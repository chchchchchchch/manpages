NAME
       pulse-daemon.conf - PulseAudio daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.pulse/daemon.conf

       /etc/pulse/daemon.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  PulseAudio  sound  server reads configuration directives from a file
       ~/.pulse/daemon.conf on startup and when that  file  doesn&apos;t  exist  from
       /etc/pulse/daemon.conf. Please note that the server also reads a configu&#8208;
       ration script on startup default.pa which also contains runtime  configu&#8208;
       ration directives.

       The  configuration  file is a simple collection of variable declarations.
       If the configuration file parser encounters either ; or # it ignores  the
       rest of the line until its end.

       For  the  settings  that take a boolean argument the values true, yes, on
       and 1 are equivalent, resp. false, no, off, 0.

GENERAL DIRECTIVES
       daemonize=  Daemonize after startup. Takes a boolean value,  defaults  to
       no. The --daemonize command line option takes precedence.

       fail=  Fail  to  start  up  if any of the directives in the configuration
       script default.pa fail. Takes a boolean argument, defaults  to  yes.  The
       --fail command line option takes precedence.

       allow-module-loading=  Allow/disallow  module loading after startup. This
       is a security feature that if dsabled makes sure that no further  modules
       may  be  loaded into the PulseAudio server after startup completed. It is
       recommended to disable this when system-instance is enabled. Please  note
       that  certain  features  like automatic hot-plug support will not work if
       this option is enabled. Takes a boolean argument, defaults  to  yes.  The
       --disallow-module-loading command line option takes precedence.

       allow-exit= Allow/disallow exit on user request. Defaults to yes.

       resample-method=  The  resampling  algorithm to use. Use one of src-sinc-
       best-quality, src-sinc-medium-quality, src-sinc-fastest,  src-zero-order-
       hold,  src-linear, trivial, speex-float-N, speex-fixed-N, ffmpeg. See the
       documentation of libsamplerate and speex for explanations of the  differ&#8208;
       ent src- and speex- methods, respectively. The method trivial is the most
       basic algorithm implemented. If you&apos;re tight on CPU consider using  this.
       On  the other hand it has the worst quality of them all. The Speex resam&#8208;
       plers take an integer quality setting in the  range  0..10  (bad...good).
       They  exist in two flavours: fixed and float. The former uses fixed point
       numbers, the latter relies on floating point  numbers.  On  most  desktop
       CPUs  the  float  point  resampler  is  a  lot faster, and it also offers
       slightly better quality. See the output of  dump-resample-methods  for  a
       complete list of all available resamplers. Defaults to speex-float-3. The
       --resample-method command line option takes precedence.  Note  that  some
       modules overwrite or allow overwriting of the resampler to use.

       enable-remixing= If disabled never upmix or downmix channels to different
       channel maps. Instead, do a simple name-based matching only. Defaults  to
       yes.

       enable-lfe-remixing=  if  disabeld when upmixing or downmixing ignore LFE
       channels. When this option is dsabled the output LFE  channel  will  only
       get  a signal when an input LFE channel is available as well. If no input
       LFE channel is available the output LFE channel will always be 0.  If  no
       output  LFE channel is available the signal on the input LFE channel will
       be ignored. Defaults to no.

       use-pid-file=   Create   a   PID   file   in   the   runtime    directory
       ($HOME/.pulse/*-runtime/pid).  If  this  is  enabled you may use commands
       like --kill or --check. If you  are  planning  to  start  more  than  one
       PulseAudio  process  per  user,  you  better disable this option since it
       effectively  disables  multiple  instances.  Takes  a  boolean  argument,
       defaults to yes. The --use-pid-file command line option takes precedence.

       cpu-limit= If disabled do not install the CPU load limiter, even on plat&#8208;
       forms where it is supported. This option is useful when debugging/profil&#8208;
       ing  PulseAudio  to  disable  disturbing SIGXCPU signals. Takes a boolean
       argument, defaults to no. The --no-cpu-limit command line argument  takes
       precedence.

       system-instance=  Run  the  daemon as system-wide instance, requires root
       priviliges. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to no. The  --system  com&#8208;
       mand line argument takes precedence.

       local-server-type=  Please  don&apos;t  use  this option if you don&apos;t have to!
       This option is currently only useful when you want D-Bus clients to use a
       remote server. This option may be removed in future versions. If you only
       want to run PulseAudio  in  the  system  mode,  use  the  system-instance
       option.  This  option  takes one of user, system or none as the argument.
       This is essentially a duplicate for the system-instance option. The  dif&#8208;
       ference is the none option, which is useful when you want to use a remote
       server with D-Bus clients. If both this and system-instance are  defined,
       this option takes precedence. Defaults to whatever the system-instance is
       set.

       enable-shm= Enable data transfer via POSIX shared memory. Takes a boolean
       argument,  defaults to yes. The --disable-shm command line argument takes
       precedence.

       shm-size-bytes= Sets the shared memory segment size for  the  daemon,  in
       bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0 it will default to some system-
       specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually  there  is  no
       need  to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel that does
       not do memory overcommit.

       lock-memory= Locks the entire PulseAudio process into memory. While  this
       might  increase  drop-out  safety when used in conjunction with real-time
       scheduling this takes away a lot of memory from other processes and might
       hence considerably slow down your system. Defaults to no.

       flat-volumes=  Enable  &apos;flat&apos;  volumes,  i.e. where possible let the sink
       volume equal the maximum of the volumes of the inputs  connected  to  it.
       Takes a boolean argument, defaults to yes.

SCHEDULING
       high-priority=  Renice the daemon after startup to become a high-priority
       process. This a good idea if you experience  drop-outs  during  playback.
       However,  this  is  a  certain security issue, since it works when called
       SUID root only, or RLIMIT_NICE is used. root is dropped immediately after
       gaining  the  nice  level  on  startup,  thus  it is presumably safe. See
       pulseaudio(1) for more information. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to
       yes. The --high-priority command line option takes precedence.

       realtime-scheduling=  Try  to  acquire  SCHED_FIFO  scheduling for the IO
       threads. The same security concerns as mentioned above apply. However, if
       PA  enters  an  endless loop, realtime scheduling causes a system lockup.
       Thus, realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted machines  for
       now.  Please  not  that  only the IO threads of PulseAudio are made real-
       time. The controlling thread is left a normally  scheduled  thread.  Thus
       enabling  the  high-priority  option is orthogonal. See pulseaudio(1) for
       more information. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to yes. The  --real&#8208;
       time command line option takes precedence.

       realtime-priority= The realtime priority to acquire, if realtime-schedul&#8208;
       ing is enabled. Note: JACK uses 10 by default, 9 for clients. Thus it  is
       recommended  to  choose  the  PulseAudio real-time priorities lower. Some
       PulseAudio threads might choose a priority a little lower or higher  than
       the specified value. Defaults to 5.

       nice-level= The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if high-priority is
       enabled. Note: on some distributions X11 uses -10 by default. Defaults to
       -11.

IDLE TIMES
       exit-idle-time=  Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this
       time in seconds passed. Use a negative value  to  disable  this  feature.
       Defaults  to  20.  The  --exit-idle-time command line option takes prece&#8208;
       dence.

       scache-idle-time= Unload autoloaded sample cache entries after being idle
       for  this time in seconds. Defaults to 20. The --scache-idle-time command
       line option takes precedence.

PATHS
       dl-search-path=  The  path  were  to  look  for  dynamic  shared  objects
       (DSOs/plugins).  You  may specify more than one path separated by colons.
       The default path depends on compile time settings.  The  --dl-search-path
       command line option takes precedence.

       default-script-file= The default configuration script file to load. Spec&#8208;
       ify an empty string for not loading a default script  file.  The  default
       behaviour is to load ~/.pulse/default.pa, and if that file does not exist
       fall back to the system wide installed version /etc/pulse/default.pa.  If
       run in system-wide mode the file /etc/pulse/system.pa is used instead. If
       -n is passed on the command line or default-script-file= is disabled  the
       default configuration script is ignored.

       load-default-script-file=  Load  the default configuration script file as
       specified in default-script-file=. Defaults to yes.

LOGGING
       log-target= The default log target. Use either stderr,  syslog  or  auto.
       The latter is equivalent to sylog in case daemonize is enabled, otherwise
       to stderr. Defaults to auto. The --log-target command line  option  takes
       precedence.

       log-level=  Log  level,  one  of debug, info, notice, warning, error. Log
       messages with a lower log level  than  specified  here  are  not  logged.
       Defaults to notice. The --log-level command line option takes precedence.
       The -v command line option might alter this setting.

       log-meta= With each logged message log the code location the message  was
       generated from. Defaults to no.

       log-time=  With each logged messages log the relative time since startup.
       Defaults to no.

       log-backtrace= When greater than 0, with each logged message log  a  code
       stack trace up the specified number of stack frames. Defaults to 0.

RESOURCE LIMITS
       See  getrlimit(2) for more information. Set to -1 if PulseAudio shall not
       touch the resource limit. Not all resource limits are  available  on  all
       operating systems.

       rlimit-as Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-rss Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-core Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-data Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-fsize Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-nofile Defaults to 256.

       rlimit-stack Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-nproc Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-locks Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-sigpending Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-msgqueue Defaults to -1.

       rlimit-memlock  Defaults  to  16  KiB.  Please  note that the JACK client
       libraries may require more locked memory.
&#12;       rlimit-nice Defaults to 31. Please make sure that the default nice  level
       as configured with nice-level fits in this resource limit, if high-prior&#8208;
       ity is enabled.

       rlimit-rtprio Defaults to 9. Please make sure that the default  real-time
       priority  level  as  configured  with  realtime-priority=  fits  in  this
       resource limit,  if  realtime-scheduling  is  enabled.  The  JACK  client
       libraries require a real-time prority of 9 by default.

       rlimit-rttime Defaults to 1000000.

DEFAULT DEVICE SETTINGS
       Most  drivers  try  to open the audio device with these settings and then
       fall back to lower settings. The default settings are CD  quality:  16bit
       native endian, 2 channels, 44100 Hz sampling.

       default-sample-format=  The  default  sampling format. Specify one of u8,
       s16le, s16be, s24le, s24be, s24-32le, s24-32be, s32le,  s32be  float32le,
       float32be, ulaw, alaw. Depending on the endianness of the CPU the formats
       s16ne, s16re, s24ne, s24re, s24-32ne, s24-32re, s32ne, s32re,  float32ne,
       float32re (for native, resp. reverse endian) are available as aliases.

       default-sample-rate= The default sample frequency.

       default-sample-channels The default number of channels.

       default-channel-map The default channel map.

       alternate-sample-rate  The  alternate sample frequency. Sinks and sources
       will use either the default-rate-rate value or this alternate value, typ&#8208;
       ically  44.1  or 48kHz. Switching between default and alternate values is
       enabled only when the sinks/sources are suspended. This option is ignored
       in  passthrough  mode where the stream rate will be used. If set to zero,
       this feature is disabled.

DEFAULT FRAGMENT SETTINGS
       Some hardware drivers require the hardware playback buffer to  be  subdi&#8208;
       vided  into several fragments. It is possible to change these buffer met&#8208;
       rics for machines with high scheduling latencies. Not all possible values
       that  may  be  configured  here are available in all hardware. The driver
       will to find the nearest setting supported. Modern drivers  that  support
       timer-based scheduling ignore these options.

       default-fragments= The default number of fragments. Defaults to 4.

       default-fragment-size-msec=The duration of a single fragment. Defaults to
       25ms (i.e. the total buffer is thus 100ms long).

DEFAULT DEFERRED VOLUME SETTINGS
       With the flat volume feature enabled, the sink HW volume is  set  to  the
       same  level  as  the highest volume input stream. Any other streams (with
       lower volumes) have the appropriate adjustment applied  in  SW  to  bring
       them  to the correct overall level. Sadly hadware mixer changes cannot be
       timed accurately and thus this change of volumes can somtimes  cause  the
       resulting  output  sound  to  be  momentarily too loud or too soft. So to
       ensure SW and HW volumes are applied concurrently without  any  glitches,
       their application needs to be synchronized. The sink implementation needs
       to support deferred volumes. The following  parameters  can  be  used  to
       refine the process.

       enable-deferred-volume= Enable deferred volume for the sinks that support
       it. This feature is enabled by default.

       deferred-volume-safety-margin-usec= The amount of time (in usec) by which
       the HW volume increases are delayed and HW volume decreases are advanced.
       Defaults to 8000 usec.

       deferred-volume-extra-delay-usec= The amount of time (in usec)  by  which
       HW volume changes are delayed. Negative values are also allowed. Defaults
       to 0.
