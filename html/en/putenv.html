PUTENV(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  PUTENV(3)



NAME
       putenv - change or add an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int putenv(char *string);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       putenv(): _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The putenv() function adds or changes the value of environment variables.
       The argument string is of the form name=value.  If name does not  already
       exist  in  the  environment, then string is added to the environment.  If
       name does exist, then the value of name in the environment is changed  to
       value.   The string pointed to by string becomes part of the environment,
       so altering the string changes the environment.

RETURN VALUE
       The putenv() function returns zero on success, or  nonzero  if  an  error
       occurs.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient space to allocate new environment.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The  putenv()  function  is  not required to be reentrant, and the one in
       libc4, libc5 and glibc 2.0 is not, but the glibc 2.1 version is.

       Description for libc4, libc5, glibc: If the argument  string  is  of  the
       form  name, and does not contain an &apos;=&apos; character, then the variable name
       is removed from the environment.  If putenv() has to allocate a new array
       environ,  and  the previous array was also allocated by putenv(), then it
       will be freed.  In no case will the old storage associated to  the  envi&#8208;
       ronment variable itself be freed.

       The  libc4  and  libc5  and  glibc  2.1.2  versions conform to SUSv2: the
       pointer string given to putenv() is used.   In  particular,  this  string
       becomes  part of the environment; changing it later will change the envi&#8208;
       ronment.  (Thus, it is an error is to call  putenv()  with  an  automatic
       variable  as  the  argument,  then return from the calling function while
       string is still part of the environment.)  However, glibc 2.0-2.1.1  dif&#8208;
       fers: a copy of the string is used.  On the one hand this causes a memory
       leak, and on the other hand it violates SUSv2.  This has  been  fixed  in
       glibc 2.1.2.

       The 4.4BSD version, like glibc 2.0, uses a copy.

       SUSv2 removes the const from the prototype, and so does glibc 2.1.3.
