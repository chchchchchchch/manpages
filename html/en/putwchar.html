PUTWCHAR(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                PUTWCHAR(3)



NAME
       putwchar - write a wide character to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t putwchar(wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The   putwchar()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       putchar(3) function.  It writes the wide character wc to stdout.  If fer&#8208;
       ror(stdout)  becomes  true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide character conver&#8208;
       sion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns  WEOF.   Otherwise
       it returns wc.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The putwchar() function returns wc if no error occurred, or WEOF to indi&#8208;
       cate an error.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of putwchar() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       It is reasonable to expect that putwchar() will actually write the multi&#8208;
       byte sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.
