PWMCONFIG(8)                                                        PWMCONFIG(8)



NAME
       pwmconfig - tests the PWM outputs of sensors and configures fancontrol


SYNOPSIS
       pwmconfig


WARNING
       pwmconfig  will  attempt  to  stop your fans, one at a time, for approxi&#8208;
       mately 5 seconds each. This may cause your processor temperature to rise.
       Verify  that  all fans are running at normal speed after this program has
       exited.  pwmconfig does its best to check that the fans are spinning when
       they  are supposed to, but due to the diversity of available motherboards
       and fans, it shouldn&apos;t be blindly trusted. Always verify by yourself.

       It is strongly recommended to run pwmconfig at a time when  there  is  no
       significant system load, to minimize the risk of overheating.


DESCRIPTION
       pwmconfig  searches  your  sensors  for pulse width modulation (PWM) con&#8208;
       trols, and tests each one to see if it controls a  fan  on  your  mother&#8208;
       board.  Note  that many motherboards do not have PWM circuitry installed,
       even if your sensor chip supports PWM.

       When a connection is established between a PWM control and a fan, pwmcon&#8208;
       fig  can  generate  a  detailed  correlation,  to show how a given fan is
       responding to various PWM duty cycles.

       Lastly, pwmconfig will enter in fancontrol configuration mode (unless you
       decide to skip that part.) In this mode, you are invited to enter several
       parameters which will determine how the fancontrol daemon  regulates  the
       speed  of  one  or more fans in your system based on temperature measure&#8208;
       ments. In particular, you will have the opportunity to establish mappings
       between  fans  and  temperature inputs, define the temperature range over
       which the speed of the fan should be adjusted  dynamically,  the  minimum
       speed at which the fan should spin, etc. See fancontrol(8) for additional
       information.


BUGS
       The term &quot;PWM&quot; is used because most fan control systems in computers  are
       based  on pulse width modulation. Some motherboards however use DC varia&#8208;
       tion instead. So, the term &quot;PWM&quot; should be seen as  a  generic  term  for
       &quot;fan speed control&quot;, regardless of the actual method used.
