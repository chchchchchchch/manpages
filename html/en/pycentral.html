DESCRIPTION

       showdefault
              Show default python version number. Deprecated, use pyversions(1)
&#12;       showsupported
              Show the supported python versions. Deprecated, use pyversions(1)

       showversions
              Show version numbers of supported  python  versions.   Deprecated,
              use pyversions(1) dh_pycentral, should not be called directly).

       version

FILES
       /etc/python/debian_config  is searched for the attribute overwrite-local.
       If set to 1, or True, existing files in /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/*-packages are
       overwritten  with  symbolic  links  to  the  pycentral  install area. The
       default is to abort the installation of a  package,  when  files  already
       exist.  This behaviour may be useful, when python libraries were manually
       installed into this directory.  The attribute byte-compile can be set  to
       a comma separated list of the values standard and optimze to indicate how
       files should be byte-compiled.
