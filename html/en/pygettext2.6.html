PYGETTEXT(1)                                                        PYGETTEXT(1)



NAME
       pygettext - Python equivalent of xgettext(1)

SYNOPSIS
       pygettext [OPTIONS] INPUTFILE ...

DESCRIPTION
       pygettext  is  deprecated.  The current version of xgettext supports many
       languages, including Python.

       pygettext uses Python&apos;s standard tokenize module to  scan  Python  source
       code,  generating .pot files identical to what GNU xgettext generates for
       C and C++ code.  From there, the standard GNU tools can be used.

       pygettext searches only for _() by default, even though GNU xgettext rec&#8208;
       ognizes  the  following  keywords: gettext, dgettext, dcgettext, and get&#8208;
       text_noop. See the -k/--keyword flag below for how to augment this.

OPTIONS
       -a, --extract-all
              Extract all strings.

       -d, --default-domain=NAME
              Rename the default output file from messages.pot to name.pot.

       -E, --escape
              Replace non-ASCII characters with octal escape sequences.

       -D, --docstrings
              Extract module, class, method, and function docstrings.  These  do
              not  need  to be wrapped in _() markers, and in fact cannot be for
              Python to consider them docstrings. (See also the -X option).

       -h, --help
              Print this help message and exit.

       -k, --keyword=WORD
              Keywords to look for in addition to the default set, which are: _

              You can have multiple -k flags on the command line.

       -K, --no-default-keywords
              Disable the default set of keywords  (see  above).   Any  keywords
              explicitly  added  with  the  -k/--keyword option are still recog&#8208;
              nized.

       --no-location
              Do not write filename/lineno location comments.

       -n, --add-location
              Write filename/lineno  location  comments  indicating  where  each
              extracted  string  is  found  in  the  source.  These lines appear
              before each msgid.  The style of comments  is  controlled  by  the
              -S/--style option.  This is the default.

       -o, --output=FILENAME
              Rename  the default output file from messages.pot to FILENAME.  If
              FILENAME is `-&apos; then the output is sent to standard out.

       -p, --output-dir=DIR
              Output files will be placed in directory DIR.
&#12;       -S, --style=STYLENAME
              Specify which style to use for location comments.  Two styles  are
              supported:

              &#183;   Solaris   # File: filename, line: line-number

              &#183;   GNU       #: filename:line

              The style name is case insensitive.  GNU style is the default.

       -v, --verbose
              Print the names of the files being processed.

       -V, --version
              Print the version of pygettext and exit.

       -w, --width=COLUMNS
              Set width of output to columns.

       -x, --exclude-file=FILENAME
              Specify  a  file  that  contains a list of strings that are not be
              extracted from the input files.  Each string to be  excluded  must
              appear on a line by itself in the file.

       -X, --no-docstrings=FILENAME
              Specify  a  file that contains a list of files (one per line) that
              should not have their docstrings extracted.  This is  only  useful
              in conjunction with the -D option above.

       If `INPUTFILE&apos; is -, standard input is read.

BUGS
       pygettext  attempts to be option and feature compatible with GNU xgettext
       where ever possible.  However some options are still missing or  are  not
       fully  implemented.   Also,  xgettext&apos;s use of command line switches with
       option arguments is broken, and in these cases,  pygettext  just  defines
       additional switches.
