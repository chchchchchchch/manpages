QJACKCTL(1)                                                          QJACKCTL(1)



NAME
       qjackctl  -  User  interface  for controlling JACK (Jack Audio Connection
       Kit)

SYNOPSIS
       qjackctl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the  qjackctl  command.   This  manual
       page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program
       does not have a manual page.


       qjackctl  is used for controlling the Jack Audio  Connection  Kit  (JACK)
       and  as  a  patchbay for ALSA MIDI devices. Qjackctl also has support for
       the JACK transport control protocol, so you can use it to start and  stop
       the  JACK  transport.  Once  you start qjackctl, you get presented with a
       single GUI window, the buttons are self-explanatory and have tooltips.


OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
