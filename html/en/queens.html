queens(6x)                     XScreenSaver manual                    queens(6x)



NAME
       queens - n queens screensaver

SYNOPSIS
       queens [-display host:display.screen] [-window] [-root] [-install] [-vis&#8208;
       ual visual] [-delay microseconds] [-wireframe] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The queens program solves the n-queens problem (where, in this program, N
       is  between  5  and 10 queens) using a straightforward backtracking algo&#8208;
       rithm.  The problem is: how may one place N queens on an  NxN  chessboard
       such that no queen can attack a sister?

OPTIONS
       queens accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -wireframe
               Render  in  wireframe instead of solid.  -fps Display the current
               frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

BUGS
       It&apos;s  not  unknown for this and other OpenGL hacks to fail under hardware
       accelaration (UtahGLX) and take the X server with them.   Texture  images
       must be 16x16 or 32x32 or 64x64 etc.
