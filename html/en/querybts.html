querybts(1)                                                          querybts(1)



NAME
       querybts - view outstanding bug reports on a debbugs server

SYNOPSIS
       querybts [options] &lt;package | number [number2]...&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       querybts is designed to provide a convenient and easy-to-use interface to
       the Debbugs bug tracking system, as used  by  Debian  and  several  other
       projects.  You can specify a package name or one or more report numbers.

OPTIONS
       The  program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`--&apos;).   A  summary  of  options  are  included
       below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       --version
              Show the version of querybts and exit.

       -A, --archive
              Browse  archived bugs instead of current reports.  Debbugs servers
              clear out closed reports after 28 days and place them in  a  sepa&#8208;
              rate  archive; this option allows those older, resolved reports to
              be viewed (at least for servers that maintain an archive).

       -B SYSTEM, --bts=SYSTEM
              Instead of the Debian bug server, use the server specified by SYS&#8208;
              TEM.  Valid options are default and debian but check --help for an
              updated list.

       -b, --buglist
              Display a bugs list for the given package.

       --latest-first
              Display the bug reports list sorted and with the latest reports at
              the top.

       --mbox-reader-cmd=MBOX_READER_CMD
              Specify  a  command to open the bug reports mbox file. You can use
              %s to substitute the mbox file to be used, and %% to insert a lit&#8208;
              eral  percent  sign.  If no %s is specified, the mbox file name is
              supplied at the end of the argument list.

       -m, --mbox
              Retrieve the given bug number(s) or package name(s) as  a  mailbox
              file, instead of viewing it. It will be dumped to standard output.

       --proxy=PROXY, --http_proxy=PROXY
              Specify  the  WWW proxy server to use to handle the queries to the
              bug tracking system.  You should only need this parameter  if  you
              are behind a firewall.

       -s, --source
              Query on source packages, rather than binary packages.

       --timeout=SECONDS
              Specify  the  network timeout, the number of seconds to wait for a
              resource to respond. If nothing is specified, a default timeout of
              1 minute is selected.

              In  case  of  a network error, there are chances it&apos;s due to a too
              low timeout: try passing the --timeout option with a higher  value
              than default.

       -u INTERFACE, --ui=INTERFACE, --interface=INTERFACE
              Specify the user interface to use.  Valid options are text, urwid,
              gtk2; default is taken from the reportbug configuration files.

       -w, --web
              Launch a web browser to view bug reports,  instead  of  using  the
              internal  interface.   This  will  also allow you to see the whole
              discussion about a particular bug at once, instead of one  message
              at a time as querybts would do.  (Only the first bug number on the
              command line will be opened.)

CONFIGURATION FILES
       querybts supports a simple run control file syntax.   Commands  are  read
       from /etc/reportbug.conf and $HOME/.reportbugrc with commands in the lat&#8208;
       ter overriding those in the former.

       Commands are not case sensitive, and currently  take  0  or  1  argument;
       arguments containing whitespace must be enclosed in quotes.

       Any line starting with # is taken to be a comment and will be ignored.

       Generally,  options  corresponding  to  the long options for querybts are
       supported, without leading -- sequences.  See  the  default  /etc/report&#8208;
       bug.conf for all acceptable options and reportbug.conf(5) for all accept&#8208;
       able options and detailed information.

       Options only supported by reportbug will be silently ignored.

ENVIRONMENT
       BROWSER
              Colon-separated list of web browsers to try; they will be tried in
              order,  until  one succeeds.  You can use %s to substitute the URL
              to be used, and %% to insert a literal percent sign.  If no %s  is
              specified, the URL will be supplied as a normal argument.

       Provides the address of a proxy server to handle the BTS query.  This
              should  be  a  valid  http  URL  for a proxy server, including any
              required port number (simply specifying a hostname, or omitting  a
              port other than 80, WILL NOT WORK).
