DESCRIPTION
       r128  is  an Xorg driver for ATI Rage 128 based video cards.  It contains
       full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit pixel depths, hardware acceleration
       of  drawing  primitives,  hardware  cursor, video modes up to 1800x1440 @
       70Hz, doublescan modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240), gamma  correction  at
       all  pixel  depths,  a  fully  programming dot clock and robust text mode
       restoration for VT switching.  Dualhead  is  supported  on  M3/M4  mobile
       chips.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The r128 driver supports all ATI Rage 128 based video cards including the
       Rage Fury AGP 32MB, the XPERT 128 AGP 16MB and the XPERT 99 AGP 8MB.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The  driver  auto-detects  all device information necessary to initialize
       the card.  However, if you have problems  with  auto-detection,  you  can
       specify:

           VideoRam - in kilobytes
           MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
           IOBase   - physical address of the MMIO registers
           ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID

       In addition, the following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;SWcursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Selects software cursor.  The default is off.

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enables  or disables all hardware acceleration.  The default is to
              enable hardware acceleration.

       Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when  in
              8  bpp mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per color
              component are used.  The default is off.

       Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV  video  overlay
              key.  The default value is undefined.

       Option &quot;Display&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Select  display  mode  for devices which support flat panels. Sup&#8208;
              ported modes are:

              &quot;FP&quot; - use flat panel;

              &quot;CRT&quot; - use cathode ray tube;
&#12;              &quot;Mirror&quot; - use both FP and CRT;

              &quot;BIOS&quot; - use mode as configured in the BIOS.

              The default is FP.


       The following Options are mostly important for non-x86 architectures:

       Option &quot;ProgramFPRegs&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable programming of the flat panel registers.  Beware
              that  this  may  damage  your panel, so use this at your own risk.
              The default depends on the device.

       Option &quot;PanelWidth&quot; &quot;integer&quot;

       Option &quot;PanelHeight&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Override the flat panel dimensions in pixels.  They  are  used  to
              program the flat panel registers and normally determined using the
              video card BIOS. If the wrong dimensions are used, the system  may
              hang.

       Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device inter&#8208;
              face (which is not supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4) for fur&#8208;
              ther  information.   Default: on for PowerPC, off for other archi&#8208;
              tectures.

       Option &quot;DMAForXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Try or don&apos;t try to use DMA for  Xv  image  transfers.  This  will
              reduce  CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause
              instabilities.  Default: off.


       The following additional Options are supported:

       Option &quot;ShowCache&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory.   A  development
              debug option.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;VGAAccess&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Tell  the  driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
              necessary for properly resuming consoles when in  VGA  text  mode,
              but  shouldn&apos;t  be  if the console is using radeonfb or some other
              graphic mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC have issues  with
              those,  and they aren&apos;t necessary unless you have a real text mode
              in console. The default is off on PowerPC  and  SPARC  and  on  on
              other architectures.


       Dualhead  Note:  The  video BIOS on some laptops interacts strangely with
       dualhead.  This can result in flickering and problems changing  modes  on
       crtc2.  If you experience these problems try toggling your laptop&apos;s video
       output switch (e.g., fn-f7, etc.)  prior  to  starting  X  or  switch  to
       another VT and back.
