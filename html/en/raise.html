RAISE(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   RAISE(3)



NAME
       raise - send a signal to the caller

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int raise(int sig);

DESCRIPTION
       The raise() function sends a signal to the calling process or thread.  In
       a single-threaded program it is equivalent to

           kill(getpid(), sig);

       In a multithreaded program it is equivalent to

           pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);

       If the signal causes a handler to be called,  raise()  will  only  return
       after the signal handler has returned.

RETURN VALUE
       raise() returns 0 on success, and nonzero for failure.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Since  version  2.3.3,  glibc implements raise() by calling tgkill(2), if
       the kernel supports that system call.  Older glibc  versions  implemented
       raise() using kill(2).

SEE ALSO
       getpid(2), kill(2), sigaction(2), signal(2), pthread_kill(3), signal(7)
