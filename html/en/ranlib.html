RANLIB(1)                     GNU Development Tools                    RANLIB(1)



NAME
       ranlib - generate index to archive.

SYNOPSIS
       ranlib [-vVt] archive

DESCRIPTION
       ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in
       the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a member of an
       archive that is a relocatable object file.

       You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.

       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows
       routines in the library to call each other without regard to their
       placement in the archive.

       The GNU ranlib program is another form of GNU ar; running ranlib is
       completely equivalent to executing ar -s.

OPTIONS
       -v
       -V
       --version
           Show the version number of ranlib.

       -t  Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
