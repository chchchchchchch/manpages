RAPT-FILE(1)                                                        RAPT-FILE(1)



NAME
       rapt-file - APT package searching utility -- search remotely

SYNOPSIS
       rapt-file [ options ] [ action ] [ pattern ]


DESCRIPTION
       rapt-file  is a command line tool for searching files in packages for the
       APT package management system.  It differs from apt-file in that it works
       with remote package indices, so it doesn&apos;t need to download full Contents
       files.

       find   Alias for search.

       list   List the contents of a package matching the pattern pattern.  This
              action  is  very  close  to the dpkg -L command except the package
              does not need to be installed or fetched.

       search Search in which package a file is included. A list of all packages
              containing the pattern pattern is returned.

              rapt-file  will  only  search  for filenames, not directory names.
              This is due to the format of the Contents files it searches.

       show   Alias for list.

OPTIONS
          -a, --architecture architecture
              Sets architecture to architecture. This option is  useful  if  you
              search  a  package  for  a  different  architecture  from  the one
              installed on your system.  It determines how the $ARCH variable in
              sources.list  is expanded (but it does not influence the search in
              any other way).

          -l, --package-only
              Only display package name; do not display file names.

          -v, --verbose
              Run rapt-file in verbose mode.

          -h, --help
              Display a short help screen.

FILES
       /etc/apt/sources.list
              Locations to fetch package contents from.

       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
              Directory with additional sources.list snippets
