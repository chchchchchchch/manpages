rcS(5)                    Debian Administrator&apos;s Manual                   rcS(5)



NAME
       rcS - variables that affect the behavior of boot scripts

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/default/rcS file contains variable settings in POSIX format:

            VAR=VAL

       Only  one  assignment  is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with &apos;#&apos;)
       are also allowed.


OPTIONS
       The following variables can be set.


       TMPTIME
              On boot the files in /tmp will be deleted  if  their  modification
              time,  file  status  time and access time are all at least TMPTIME
              days ago.  A value of 0 means that files are removed regardless of
              age.   If you don&apos;t want the system to clean /tmp then set TMPTIME
              to a negative value (e.g., -1) or to the word infinite.


       SULOGIN
              Setting this to yes causes init to spawn a sulogin on the  console
              early  in  the  boot process.  If the administrator does not login
              then the sulogin session will time out after 30  seconds  and  the
              boot process will continue.


       DELAYLOGIN
              Normally  the  system will not let non-root users log in until the
              boot process is complete and the system has finished switching  to
              the  default runlevel (usually level 2).  However, in theory it is
              safe to log in a  bit  earlier,  namely,  as  soon  as  inetd  has
              started.  Setting the variable to no allows earlier login; setting
              the variable to yes prevents it.

              Some details: The DELAYLOGIN variable controls whether or not  the
              file  /var/lib/initscripts/nologin  is  created  during  the  boot
              process and deleted at the end of it.  /etc/nologin is normally  a
              symbolic  link  to  the  latter location, and the login(1) program
              refuses to allow non-root  logins  so  long  as  (the  target  of)
              /etc/nologin  exists.   If  you  set the variable to no then it is
              advisable to ensure  that  /var/lib/initscripts/nologin  does  not
              exist.


       VERBOSE
              Setting  this  option  to  no  (in  lower case) will make the boot
              process a bit less verbose.  Setting this option to yes will  make
              the boot process a bit more verbose.


       FSCKFIX
              When  the  root  and  all  other file systems are checked, fsck is
              invoked with the -a option which means &quot;autorepair&quot;.  If there are
              major  inconsistencies  then  the fsck process will bail out.  The
              system will print a message asking the administrator to repair the
              file  system  manually and will present a root shell prompt (actu&#8208;
              ally a sulogin prompt) on the console.  Setting this option to yes
              causes  the  fsck commands to be run with the -y option instead of
              the -a option.  This will tell fsck always to repair the file sys&#8208;
              tems without asking for permission.


       ASYNCMOUNTNFS
              Set  this  to  &apos;no&apos;  to  disable  asynchronous mounting of network
              drives when the network interfaces are mounted, and instead do  it
              only  once  when  the machine boots.  The default is &apos;yes&apos;.  It is
              useful to disable this on machines where the root file  system  is
              NFS, until ifup from ifupdown works properly in such setup.


NOTE
       The  EDITMOTD, RAMRUN and UTC variables are no longer used.  The RAMLOCK,
       RAMSHM and RAMTMP variables have been moved to /etc/default/tmpfs; RAMSHM
       and  RAMTMP settings in rcS are used (if set) for backward compatibility,
       but will be overridden by settings enabled  in  /etc/default/tmpfs.   See
       tmpfs(5)  for  further  details.   The  settings  are  not  automatically
       migrated to /etc/default/tmpfs.  Please update /etc/default/tmpfs  appro&#8208;
       priately.   The  UTC  setting  is replaced by the UTC or LOCAL setting in
       /etc/adjtime,  and  should  have  been   migrated   automatically.    See
       hwclock(5)  and  hwclock(8) for further details on configuring the system
       clock.
