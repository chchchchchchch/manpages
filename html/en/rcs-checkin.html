NAME
       rcs-checkin - check files into RCS

SYNOPSIS
       rcs-checkin [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       rcs-checkin is a helper script for checking files into RCS.  This program
       is distributed with GNU Emacs.

       This program converts files with an old Emacs-style version  history  for
       use  with  the  Emacs 19 version control interface VC, which likes to use
       RCS as its back end.

       For each file to be processed, the script looks for Emacs  version  files
       related  to  it.  These  files are checked in as deltas, oldest first, so
       that the contents of the file itself becomes the latest revision  in  the
       master.

       The  first line of each file is used as its description.  The file itself
       is not deleted, as under VC with vc-keep-workfiles at its default  of  t,
       but all the version files are.

       If  an argument file is already version-controlled under RCS, any version
       files are added to the list of deltas and deleted, and then the  workfile
       is  checked  in  again as the latest version.  This is probably not quite
       what was wanted, and is the main reason VC doesn&apos;t simply call this to do
       checkins.

       In  order  to  make  it  easier  to  use  rcs-checkin  *, files which are
       detectably either RCS masters (with names ending in ,v) or Emacs  version
       files (with names containing ~) are ignored.

OPTIONS
       The program accepts no options.

SEE ALSO
       The  Emacs  version control interface is documented in the GNU Emacs man&#8208;
       ual, which  you  can  read  using Info, either from Emacs or as a  stand&#8208;
       alone program.
