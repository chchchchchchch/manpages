NAME
       rdfproc - Redland RDF processor utility

SYNOPSIS
       rdfproc [options] store-name command arg...

EXAMPLE
       rdfproc test parse http://planetrdf.com/guide/rss.rdf
       rdfproc test print
       rdfproc test serialize ntriples

DESCRIPTION
       The rdfproc utility allows parsing, querying, manipulating and  serializ&#8208;
       ing of RDF content using the Redland RDF library.   The store-name  is  a
       Redland  store name, typically a short identifier.  The arguments to com&#8208;
       mand vary and are explained in section COMMANDS below.

OPTIONS
       rdfproc uses the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options  start&#8208;
       ing with two dashes (`-&apos;) if supported by the getopt_long function.  Oth&#8208;
       erwise the short options are only available.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the options.

       -c, --contexts
              Use a store with Redland contexts.

       -n, --new
              Make a new store, overwriting any existing one.

       -o, --output FORMAT
              Set the output FORMAT for sequences of triples,  such  as  from  a
              search  (find command) to a Redland serializer.  Use -h or -o help
              to see the full list of supported formats.

       -p, --password
              Read the storage option &apos;password&apos; from  standard  input.   Termi&#8208;
              nated by end of line (&apos;\n&apos;) or end of file.  This is equivalent to
              setting it using -t or  --storage-options  but  does  not  require
              exposing the password in the argument list.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress informational messages (that go to stderr)

       -r, --results FORMAT
              Set the query results syntax format.  Use -h or -r help to see the
              full list of query result formats.

              The exact list of formats depends on what libraptor(3)  was  built
              with but is given correct in the usage message with -h.

       -s, --storage TYPE
              Set  the  Redland storage type (default &apos;hashes&apos;).  If environment
              variable RDFPROC_STORAGE_TYPE is set, the storage type given  here
              will override it.  Use -h or -s help to see the full list of query
              result formats.

       -t, --storage-options OPTIONS
              Set options  for  the  the  Redland  storage,  default  is  &quot;hash-
              type=&apos;bdb&apos;,dir=&apos;.&apos;&quot;   to  match the default storage &quot;hashes&quot;.  For
              storages types such as &apos;mysql&apos; that need extra options this  would
              typically     be     something     like     &quot;host=&apos;hostname&apos;,data&#8208;
              base=&apos;dbname&apos;,user=&apos;abc&apos;,password=&apos;pass&apos;&quot;.  If  environment  vari&#8208;
              able  RDFPROC_STORAGE_OPTIONS  is  set,  the storage options given
              here will be applied afterwards.

       -v, --version
              Print the Redland version and exit.

       -V, --verbose
              Show informational messages on stderr.

COMMANDS
       Where a node is allowed, such  as  NODE,  SUBJECT,  PREDICATE  or  OBJECT
       below,  simple  heuristics are used to guess which are blank node identi&#8208;
       fiers, URIs or literals (to add a statement  with  a  literal,  use  add-
       typed).  If the item starts with _: then it is assumed to be a blank node
       identifier, otherwise if it matches something:// it is assumed  to  be  a
       URI,  otherwise it is a literal.  Literals are only allowed as objects of
       statements and blank nodes are not allowed as predicates.

       add SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT [CONTEXT]
              Add the given triple to graph, in the optional Redland context  if
              the CONTEXT node is given.


       add-typed SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT OBJECT-LANG OBJECT-URI [CONTEXT]
              Add  the triple with the datatyped literal object to the graph, in
              the optional Redland context if CONTEXT is given.


       arc SUBJECT OBJECT

       arcs SUBJECT OBJECT
              Show one node/all nodes that match triples (SUBJECT, ?, OBJECT)


       arcs-in NODE
              Show all properties of triples with NODE as a subject.


       arcs-out NODE
              Show all properties of triples with NODE as an object.


       contains SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT
              Check if the given triple is in the graph.


       contexts
              List all the contexts in the graph (if contexts are enabled).


       find SUBJECT|- PREDICATE|- OBJECT|- [CONTEXT]
              Find matching triples to the given statement where - stands for  a
              blank that matches any node.  If CONTEXT is given, only search for
              triples in that context node.


       has-arc-in NODE ARC
              Check that there is a triple with NODE as a subject and ARC  as  a
              predicate.


       has-arc-out NODE ARC
              Check  that  there  is a triple with NODE as a object and ARC as a
              predicate.


       parse URI|FILENAME [SYNTAX| [BASE URI]]
              Parse syntax at URI into the graph using SYNTAX which can  be  one
              of  rdfxml (RDF/XML, default), ntriples, turtle, rss-tag-soup (for
              all RSS and Atoms), grddl and guess to use content hints and  pro&#8208;
              tocol  information  to work it out. (This list changes faster than
              this manual page) If FILENAME is a existing file, the  appropriate
              URI  will  be  generated  for  it.  If parsing returns errors, the
              return code will be non-0.


       parse-stream URI|FILENAME [SYNTAX [BASE URI [CONTEXT]]
              Streaming parse syntax at URI into the graph  using  SYNTAX  which
              can  be one of rdfxml (RDF/XML, default) or ntriples.  If FILENAME
              is an existing file, the appropriate URI will be generated for it.
              If  the  optional  CONTEXT  URI is given, the triples are added to
              that context.  If parsing returns errors, the return code will  be
              non-0.


       print  Print  the  graph triples in a simple format showing context nodes
              if present.


       query NAME|- URI|- QUERY-STRING
              Run QUERY-STRING query in language NAME returning  variable  bind&#8208;
              ings,  a  boolean or RDF graph depending on the query.  Query lan&#8208;
              guage can be &apos;sparql&apos; or &apos;rdql&apos;.


       remove SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT [CONTEXT]
              Remove the given triple graph, in the optional Redland context  if
              CONTEXT is given.


       remove-context CONTEXT
              Remove all triples in the graph with the Redland context CONTEXT.


       serialize [SYNTAX [URI [MIME-TYPE]]]
              Serializes  the graph to a syntax with a particular ISYNTAX URI or
              Internet Media Type/MIME  Type.   The  default  is  RDF/XML  (NAME
              &quot;rdfxml&quot;,  MIME  Type  &quot;application/rdf/xml&quot;) if none of the above
              are given.  Other alternatives are &quot;ntriples&quot; (no MIME Type).


       source PREDICATE OBJECT

       sources PREDICATE OBJECT
              Show one node/all nodes that match triples (?, PREDICATE, OBJECT)


       target SUBJECT PREDICATE

       targets SUBJECT PREDICATE
              Show one node/all nodes that match triples (SUBJECT, PREDICATE, ?)


ENVIRONMENT
       RDFPROC_STORAGE_OPTIONS can be set to provide storage options instead  of
       using  the  option  -t,  --storage-options OPTIONS.  When both are given,
       command options are applied last.

       RDFPROC_STORAGE_TYPE can be set to provide  a  storage  type  instead  of
       using  the  option  -s, --storage TYPE.  When both are given, the storage
       type from the command is used.
