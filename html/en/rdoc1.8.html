rdoc1.8(1)                                                            rdoc1.8(1)



NAME
       rdoc1.8 - Generate documentation from Ruby script files

SYNOPSIS
           rdoc1.8 [options]  [names...]

DESCRIPTION
       Files  are parsed, and the information they contain collected, before any
       output is produced. This allows cross references between all files to  be
       resolved.  If  a  name  is  a directory, it is traversed. If no names are
       specified, all Ruby files in the current directory  (and  subdirectories)
       are processed.

       Available output formatters: chm, html, ri, xml

       For information on where the output goes, use:
           rdoc --help-output

OPTIONS
       --accessor, -A accessorname[,..]
              comma  separated  list  of additional class methods that should be
              treated like &apos;attr_reader&apos; and friends. Option  may  be  repeated.
              Each  accessorname  may  have &apos;=text&apos; appended, in which case that
              text appears where the r/w/rw appears for normal accessors.

       --all, -a
              include all methods (not just public) in the output.

       --charset, -c charset
              specifies HTML character-set

       --debug, -D
              displays lots on internal stuff

       --diagram, -d
              generate diagrams showing  modules  and  classes.   You  need  dot
              V1.8.6  or  later  to  use  the --diagram option correctly. Dot is
              available                                                     from
              &lt;URL:http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/&gt;.

       --exclude, -x pattern
              do  not process files or directories matching pattern. Files given
              explicitly on the command line will never be excluded.

       --extension, -E new=old
              treat files ending with .new as if they ended with .old. Using &apos;-E
              cgi=rb&apos; will cause xxx.cgi to be parsed as a Ruby file

       --fileboxes, -F
              classes  are  put  in  boxes  which  represents files, where these
              classes reside. Classes shared between  more  than  one  file  are
              shown with list of files that sharing them.  Silently discarded if
              --diagram is not given Experimental.

       --fmt, -f formatname
              set the output formatter (see below).

       --help, -h
              print usage.

       --help-output, -O
              explain the various output options.
&#12;       --image-format, -I gif|png|jpg|jpeg
              sets output image format for diagrams. Can be png, gif, jpeg, jpg.
              If this option is omitted, png is used. Requires --diagram.

       --include, -i dir[,dir...]
              set (or add to) the list of directories to be searched when satis&#8208;
              fying :include: requests. Can be used more than once.

       --inline-source, -S
              show method source code inline, rather than via a popup link.

       --line-numbers, -N
              include line numbers in the source code

       --main, -m name
              name will be the initial page displayed.

       --merge, -M
              when creating ri output, merge processed classes  into  previously
              documented classes of the name name.

       --one-file, -1
              put all the output into a single file.

       --op, -o dir
              set the output directory.

       --opname, -n name
              set the name of the output. Has no effect for HTML.

       --promiscuous, -p
              When  documenting  a  file  that  contains  a module or class also
              defined in other files, show all stuff for  that  module/class  in
              each  files page. By default, only show stuff defined in that par&#8208;
              ticular file.

       --quiet, -q
              don&apos;t show progress as we parse.

       --ri, -r
              generate output for use by &apos;ri.&apos;  The  files  are  stored  in  the
              &apos;.rdoc&apos; directory under your home directory unless overridden by a
              subsequent --op parameter, so no special privileges are needed.

       --ri-site, -R
              generate output for use  by  &apos;ri.&apos;  The  files  are  stored  in  a
              site-wide  directory, making them accessible to others, so special
              privileges are needed.

       --ri-system, -Y
              generate output for use by &apos;ri.&apos; The files are stored  in  a  sys&#8208;
              tem-level  directory, making them accessible to others, so special
              privileges are needed. This option is intended to be  used  during
              Ruby installations.

       --show-hash, -H
              a  name  of the form #name in a comment is a possible hyperlink to
              an instance method name. When displayed, the &apos;#&apos; is removed unless
              this option is specified.

       --style, -s stylesheet-url
              specifies the URL of a separate stylesheet.

       --tab-width, -w n
              set the width of tab characters (default 8).

       --template, -T template-name
              set the template used when generating output.
&#12;       --title, -t text
              set text as the title for the output.

       --version, -v
              display  RDoc&apos;s version.

       --webcvs, -W url
              specify  a  URL  for  linking to a web frontend to CVS. If the URL
              contains a &#180;%s&apos;, the name of the current file will be substituted;
              if  the  URL doesn&apos;t contain a &apos;%s&apos;, the filename will be appended
              to it.
