READAHEAD(2)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               READAHEAD(2)



NAME
       readahead - perform file readahead into page cache

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t offset, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       readahead() populates the page cache with data from a file so that subse&#8208;
       quent reads from that file will not block on disk I/O.  The  fd  argument
       is  a file descriptor identifying the file which is to be read.  The off&#8208;
       set argument specifies the starting point from which data is to  be  read
       and  count specifies the number of bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in
       whole pages, so that offset is effectively rounded down to a page  bound&#8208;
       ary and bytes are read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal
       to (offset+count).  readahead() does not read beyond the end of the file.
       readahead()  blocks  until the specified data has been read.  The current
       file offset of the open file referred to by fd is left unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, readahead() returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned, with errno
       set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EINVAL fd  does  not  refer  to  a  file type to which readahead() can be
              applied.

VERSIONS
       The readahead() system call appeared in Linux 2.4.13; glibc  support  has
       been provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       The  readahead()  system  call  is  Linux-specific, and its use should be
       avoided in portable applications.
