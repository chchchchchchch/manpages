DESCRIPTION
       readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object files.
       The options control what particular information to display.

       elffile... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and 64-bit ELF
       files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.

       This program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more
       detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if there is a
       bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
       equivalent.  At least one option besides -v or -H must be given.

       -a
       --all
           Equivalent to specifying --file-header, --program-headers,
           --sections, --symbols, --relocs, --dynamic, --notes and
           --version-info.

       -h
       --file-header
           Displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of
           the file.

       -l
       --program-headers
       --segments
           Displays the information contained in the file&apos;s segment headers, if
           it has any.

       -S
       --sections
       --section-headers
           Displays the information contained in the file&apos;s section headers, if
           it has any.

       -g
       --section-groups
           Displays the information contained in the file&apos;s section groups, if
           it has any.

       -t
       --section-details
           Displays the detailed section information. Implies -S.

       -s
       --symbols
       --syms
           Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it has
           one.

       -e
       --headers
           Display all the headers in the file.  Equivalent to -h -l -S.

       -n
       --notes
           Displays the contents of the NOTE segments and/or sections, if any.

       -r
       --relocs
           Displays the contents of the file&apos;s relocation section, if it has
           one.

       -u
       --unwind
           Displays the contents of the file&apos;s unwind section, if it has one.
           Only the unwind sections for IA64 ELF files are currently supported.

       -d
       --dynamic
           Displays the contents of the file&apos;s dynamic section, if it has one.

       -V
       --version-info
           Displays the contents of the version sections in the file, it they
           exist.

       -A
       --arch-specific
           Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there is
           any.

       -D
       --use-dynamic
           When displaying symbols, this option makes readelf use the symbol
           table in the file&apos;s dynamic section, rather than the one in the
           symbols section.

       -x &lt;number or name&gt;
       --hex-dump=&lt;number or name&gt;
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal
           bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the
           section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
           name in the object file.

       -R &lt;number or name&gt;
       --relocated-dump=&lt;number or name&gt;
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal
           bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the
           section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
           name in the object file.  The contents of the section will be
           relocated before they are displayed.

       -p &lt;number or name&gt;
       --string-dump=&lt;number or name&gt;
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as printable strings.
           A number identifies a particular section by index in the section
           table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the
           object file.

       -c
       --archive-index
           Displays the file symbol index infomation contained in the header
           part of binary archives.  Performs the same function as the t command
           to ar, but without using the BFD library.

       -w[lLiaprmfFsoR]
       --debug-dump[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges]
           Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are
           present.  If one of the optional letters or words follows the switch
           then only data found in those specific sections will be dumped.

           Note: the =decodedline option will display the interpreted contents
           of a .debug_line section whereas the =rawline option dumps the
           contents in a raw format.

       -I
       --histogram
           Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the
           contents of the symbol tables.

       -v
       --version
           Display the version number of readelf.

       -W
       --wide
           Don&apos;t break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default readelf
           breaks section header and segment listing lines for 64-bit ELF files,
           so that they fit into 80 columns. This option causes readelf to print
           each section header resp. each segment one a single line, which is
           far more readable on terminals wider than 80 columns.

       -H
       --help
           Display the command line options understood by readelf.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
