NAME
       rlwrap - readline wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       rlwrap [rlwrap-options] command ...

DESCRIPTION
       rlwrap  runs  the  specified command, intercepting user input in order to
       provide readline&apos;s line editing, persistent history and completion.

       rlwrap tries to be completely transparent - you (or your shell) shouldn&apos;t
       notice  any  difference  between  command and rlwrap command - except the
       added readline functionality, of course.  This should even hold true when
       you  are re-directing, piping and sending signals from and to command, or
       when command manipulates its terminal settings.

       There  are  many  options  to  add  (programmable)   completion,   handle
       multi-line  input,  colour  and  re-write prompts. If you don&apos;t need them
       (and you probably don&apos;t), you can skip the rest of this manpage.

OPTIONS
       -a, --always-readline [&lt;password_prompt&gt;]
              Always remain in &quot;readline mode&quot;, regardless of command&apos;s terminal
              settings.  Use this option if you want to use rlwrap with commands
              that already use readline.  NB: With this option, rlwrap will echo
              (and save) passwords, unless you give command&apos;s password prompt as
              an argument.  The argument  is  optional;  if  given,  it  has  to
              directly follow the option  without an intervening space.

              On  a  linux  machine you can use the -N (--no-children) option to
              prevent the wrapping of pagers and editors  called  from  command;
              this should make them much more usable

              Many commands that need --always-readline may also need -t dumb to
              prevent terminal control sequences from confusing rlwrap (although
              this will annoy the above-mentioned pagers and editors)


       -A, --ansi-colour-aware
              Prompts that use colour will confuse rlwrap, especially at the end
              of long input lines. This option will make rlwrap  better  behaved
              in  such cases.  If the prompt contains anything fancier than ANSI
              colour codes, this option may actually make things worse.

       -b, --break-chars &lt;list_of_characters&gt;
              Consider the specified  characters  word-breaking  (whitespace  is
              always  word-breaking).  This  determines  what  is  considered  a
              &quot;word&quot;, both when completing and when building a  completion  word
              list from files specified by -f options following (not preceding!)
              it.  Default list (){}[],+-=&amp;^%$#@&quot;&quot;;|\ Unless -c is specified,  /
              and . (period) are included in the default list.

       -c, --complete-filenames
              Complete  filenames (filename completion is always case-sensitive,
              even with the -i option) When doing this, rlwrap  keeps  track  of
              commands working directory.

       -C, --command-name &lt;command_name&gt;|&lt;N&gt;
              Use command_name instead of command to determine the names of his&#8208;
              tory and completion files, and to initialise readline  (as  speci&#8208;
              fied  in  ~/.inputrc). A numeric argument N &gt; 0 means: use the Nth
              argument counting backwards from the end of the argument list

       -D, --history-no-dupes n
              How agressively to weed out duplicate entries from the input  his&#8208;
              tory.  If n = 0, all inputs are kept in the history list, if n = 1
              (this is the default) consecutive duplicates are dropped from  the
              list,  while  n = 2 will make rlwrap drop all previous occurrences
              of the current input from the list.

       -f, --file file
              Split file into words and add them to the  completion  word  list.
              This  option  can be given more than once, and adds to the default
              completion list in  $RLWRAP_HOME or /usr/share/rlwrap/completions.

       -g, --forget-matching regexp
              Forget (i.e. drop from history list) all input  lines  that  match
              the  POSIX  1003.2 regular expression regexp.  The match is always
              case-insensitive. regexp may be an ordinary string. For more about
              regular expressions, see  regex (7)

       -h, --help
              Print a short help message.

       -H, --history-filename file
              Read  command  history   from  file  (and  write  it back there if
              --histsize &gt;= 0)

       -i, --case-insensitive
              Ignore case when completing (filename completion remains case-sen&#8208;
              sitive). This option has to come before any -f options.

       -I, --pass-sigint-as-sigterm
              Send  a  TERM signal to command when an INT is received (e.g. when
              you press CTRL-C).

       -l, --logfile file
              When in readline mode, append command&apos;s output (including  echo&apos;ed
              user input) to file (creating file when it doesn&apos;t exist).

       -n, --no-warnings
              Don&apos;t print warnings.

       -N, --no-children
              (linux  only)  Don&apos;t  rlwrap  command&apos;s  children: whenever rlwrap
              notices that command is  waiting  for  one  of  its  children,  it
              switches  to direct mode, handing down all keypresses immediately.
              With this option commands that  need  --always-readline  can  call
              editors and pagers and still be usable.

       -m, --multi-line [&lt;newline_substitute&gt;]
              Enable  multi-line  input  using  a &quot;newline substitute&quot; character
              sequence (&quot; \ &quot;, [space-backslash-space] by default). Newline sub&#8208;
              stitutes  are  translated  to newlines before sending the input to
              command.  With this  option,  you  can  call  an  external  editor
              $RLWRAP_EDITOR   on   the   (expanded)   current  input  with  the
              rlwrap_call_editor  key  (CTRL-^  by  default)  The  argument   is
              optional;  if given, it has to directly follow the option  without
              an intervening space.

       -o, --one-shot
              Send an EOF to command after accepting the first line of input

       -O, --only-cook regexp
              Only ever &quot;cook&quot; prompts that match regexp

       -p, --prompt-colour [&lt;colour_name&gt;|&lt;Colour_name&gt;|&lt;colour_spec&gt;]
              Use one of the colour names black, red, green, yellow, blue, cyan,
              purple (=magenta) or white, or an ANSI-conformant &lt;colour_spec&gt; to
              colour any prompt displayed by command. An uppercase  colour  name
              (Yellow  or  YELLOW  )  gives a bold prompt.  Prompts that already
              contain (colour) escape sequences or one of the  readline  &quot;ignore
              markers&quot;  (ASCII  0x01  and  0x02)  are  not coloured. This option
              implies  --ansi-colour-aware.   &lt;colour   spec&gt;   has   the   form
              &lt;attr&gt;;&lt;fg&gt;[;&lt;bg&gt;]  Example:  -p&apos;1;31&apos; will give a bold red prompt
              on the current background (this is the default when no argument is
              given).  Google for &apos;ANSI color&apos; to learn more about colour codes.
              The argument is optional; if given, it has to directly follow  the
              option  without an intervening space.

       -P, --pre-given text
              Start  rlwrap  with   text in its edit buffer (this will automati&#8208;
              cally set the --always-readline option).

       -q, --quote-characters &lt;list_of_characters&gt;
              Assume that the given characters act as quotes, e.g. when matching
              parentheses.  Take care to escape the list properly for your shell
              (example: -q &quot;\&quot;&apos;&quot;, which happens to be the default,  or  -q  &quot;\&quot;&quot;
              which will be better for Lisp users)

       -r, --remember
              Put all words seen on in- and output on the completion list.

       -R, --renice
              Make  rlwrap  nicer  than  command (cf nice (1)). This may prevent
              rlwrap from interrupting command to display a prompt when  command
              is still &quot;thinking&quot; about what to output next.

       -s, --histsize &lt;N&gt;
              Limit  the  history list to N entries, truncating the history file
              (default: 300). A negative size -N means the same as N, but treats
              the history file as read-only.

       -S, --substitute-prompt &lt;prompt&gt;
              Substitute  the specified prompt for  command&apos;s own prompt. Mainly
              useful when  command doesn&apos;t have a prompt.

       -t, --set-term-name &lt;name&gt;
              Set command&apos;s TERM to &lt;name&gt;. Programs that  confuse  rlwrap  with
              fancy screen control codes can sometimes be tamed by specifying -t
              dumb

       -v, --version
              Print rlwrap version.

       -w, --wait-before-prompt &lt;timeout&gt;
              In order to determine if   command&apos;s  last  output  is  a  prompt,
              rlwrap  waits  timeout millisecs after receiving it.  Only when no
              more output has arrived, it is cooked (coloured,  filtered  and/or
              replaced  by  a  substitute  prompt)  and  displayed  as a prompt.
              Before this the prompt is displayed &quot;uncooked&quot;. Most  users  won&apos;t
              notice,  but  heavy  cookers  can prepend the timeout with a minus
              sign, making rlwrap hold back the prompt until it has been  cooked
              (&quot;patient mode&quot;). This will prevent flashing of the prompt, but it
              will also interfere with long output lines and make switches  from
              direct to readline mode less reliable. Default timeout: 40 ms

       -z, --filter &lt;filter&gt;
              Use a filter to change rlwrap&apos;s behaviour. A filter can be used to
              keep certain input out of the history, to change  the  prompt,  to
              implement  simple macros or programmable completion.. rlwrap comes
              with a special perl module (cf. RlwrapFilter(3pm)) for easy filter
              writing.  A  number of example filters are installed in the direc&#8208;
              tory  /usr/share/rlwrap/filters.  &quot;rlwrap  -z  &lt;filter&gt;&quot;  displays
              information  about  a  filter,  &quot;rlwrap -z listing&quot; lists all cur&#8208;
              rently installed filters.  If &lt;filter&gt; needs arguments, you should
              quote the whole filter command line:

                  rlwrap -z &apos;filter args&apos; command

              If  this command line contains shell metacharacters, rlwrap passes
              it to the system shell for parsing.

EXAMPLES
       Run nc (netcat) with command-line editing and history
          rlwrap nc

       Wrap smbclient (which uses readline itself), keep passwords  out  of  the
       history and don&apos;t wrap commands launched from smbclient (like more)
          rlwrap -aPassword: -N smbclient //PEANUT/C

       Wrap  gauche  (a  Scheme  interpreter)  with  a  bold blue prompt, enable
       mult-line editing and don&apos;t consider single quotes as quotes (so that the
       parentheses in (print &apos;q) match)
          rlwrap -pBlue -m -q&apos;&quot;&apos; gosh

       Get a list of all currently installed filters
          rlwrap -z listing

       Get help for the filter pipeto
          rlwrap -z pipeto

       Wrap  sqlite3, use the pipeto filter to be able to pipe the output of SQL
       commands through grep and/or less, complete (case-insensitively)  on  the
       SQL keywords in &apos;sql_words&apos;
          rlwrap -a -z pipeto -i -f sql_words sqlite3 contacts.db

       In  a  shell  script,  use rlwrap in &apos;one-shot&apos; mode as a replacement for
       read
          order=`rlwrap -S &apos;Your pizza? &apos;-H past_orders -P Margherita -o cat`


DIRECT MODE AND READLINE MODE
       Most simple console commands put your terminal either in &quot;cooked&quot;  or  in
       &quot;raw&quot;  mode.  In  cooked  mode the terminal will wait until you press the
       ENTER key before handing the entire line to  the  program,  in  raw  mode
       every key you press is handed down immediately. In cooked mode you gener&#8208;
       ally can use the backspace key, but not the  arrow  keys,  to  edit  your
       input.  Most  simple  console commands use cooked mode whenever they want
       whole input lines, and raw mode when they want  single  keypresses.  More
       sophisticated  commands tend to use raw mode all the time; they may some&#8208;
       times be rlwrappable with the -a (and -N) options.

       When you rlwrap command, rlwrap will run it a in a separate session, with
       its  own &quot;pseudo-terminal&quot; (pty), and monitor this pty to see whether the
       pty is in raw mode or in cooked mode. In the first case, rlwrap will copy
       all  input and output directly between command and your terminal (&quot;direct
       mode&quot;). In the second case, rlwrap will use readline to edit  your  input
       (&quot;readline  mode&quot;),  and  monitor command&apos;s output - every last line that
       doesn&apos;t end with a newline is a potential prompt. How it handles  such  a
       candidate prompt depends on its being in &quot;patient&quot; or &quot;impatient&quot; mode:

PATIENT AND IMPATIENT MODE
       If  command  writes a lot of output, it tends to be written (and read) in
       &quot;chunks&quot;. Not all chunks will end with a newline, and we need to  distin&#8208;
       guish  their  last  lines  from  real  prompts,  especially if we want to
       re-write (&quot;cook&quot;) prompts. rlwrap solves this (almost) by waiting a  lit&#8208;
       tle,  to  see if there is more to come. &quot;A little&quot; is 40 msec by default,
       but this can be changed with the -w option.  Normally rlwrap  writes  the
       suspected  prompt as soon as it is received, replacing it with a &quot;cooked&quot;
       version afer the wait time. This is called &quot;impatient&quot; mode. If you don&apos;t
       like  the  flashing  effect  (which  will  only occur when you &quot;cook&quot; the
       prompt heavily) you can put rlwrap in &quot;patient  mode&quot;  by   specifying  a
       negative  value  with  -w  (e.g.  -w -40). Rlwrap will then hold back the
       prompt and only print if after cooking.

COOKING PROMPTS
       If and when rlwrap decides that it has a prompt, it will perform a number
       of actions on it, depending on the given options: filtering (-z), substi&#8208;
       tuting (-S) and colouring (-p), in this  order.  The  resulting  &quot;cooked&quot;
       prompt is then printed (after erasing the &quot;raw&quot; prompt, if necessary)

SPECIAL KEYS
       Control + O
              Accept  the  current  line,  but don&apos;t put it in the history list.
              This     action     has     a      readline      command      name
              rlwrap-accept-line-and-forget

       Control + ^
              Use  an  external editor to edit the current input (this will only
              work if the -m option is set). This action has a readline  command
              name  rlwrap-call-editor

       These  special  keys  were  chosen because are not currently bound to any
       readline action. If you don&apos;t like them, (or your window manager swallows
       them) they can be re-bound more sensibly by including lines like the fol&#8208;
       lowing in your ~/.inputrc:

          &quot;\M-\C-m&quot;: rlwrap-accept-line-and-forget # ESC-ENTER
          &quot;\C-xe&quot;:   rlwrap-call-editor            # CTRL-x e

       cf. the readline(3) manpage for more about re-binding keys

ENVIRONMENT
       RLWRAP_HOME:
              directory in which the history and completion files are kept.

       RLWRAP_EDITOR (or else EDITOR, or else VISUAL):
              editor to use for multi-line input. Example:

           export RLWRAP_EDITOR=&quot;microemacs -l%L:%C&quot;
           export RLWRAP_EDITOR=&quot;vi +%L&quot;

       The last example is the default; %L and %C are replaced by line and  col&#8208;
       umn numbers corresponding to the cursor position in rlwrap&apos;s edit buffer

       RLWRAP_FILTERDIR:
              Any  executable along your PATH can in theory be used as a filter,
              but because filters have to follow a  rather  outlandish  protocol
              (cf.  RlwrapFilter  (3))  it is a good idea to keep them separate.
              This is why rlwrap adds a special filter directory to  $PATH  just
              before    launching    a    filter.    By    default,    this   is
              /usr/share/rlwrap/filters, but $RLWRAP_FILTERDIR is used if set.

SIGNALS
       A number of signals are forwarded to command: HUP INT QUIT USR1 USR2 TERM
       and  (by way of resizing command&apos;s terminal) WINCH. Some care is taken to
       handle TSTP (usually a result of a CTRL-Z from the terminal)  sensibly  -
       for  example,  after suspending rlwrap in the middle of a line edit, con&#8208;
       tinuing (by typing &apos;fg&apos;) will land you at the exact spot where  you  sus&#8208;
       pended it.

       Filters  that  take more than 1 second to respond can be interrupted by a
       CTRL-C from the terminal (although rlwrap will not survive this)

       If command changes the keystrokes that send a particular signal from  the
       keyboard (like emacs, which uses CTRL-G instead of CTRL-C) rlwrap will do
       the same.

       When command is killed by a signal, rlwrap will clean up, reset its  sig&#8208;
       nal handlers an then commit suicide by sending the same signal to itself.
       This means that your shell sees the same exit status  as  it  would  have
       seen without rlwrap.


REDIRECTION
       When  the  standard  input  is not a terminal, editing input doesn&apos;t make
       sense, so rlwrap will ignore all options and simply execute command. When
       stdout  (or stderr) is not a terminal, rlwrap will re-open it to /dev/tty
       (the users terminal) after it has started  command,   so  that  command&apos;s
       output  is  redirected  as  expected, but keyboard input and rlwrap error
       messages are still visible.

       The upshot of this is that rlwrap command behaves more or less like  com&#8208;
       mand when redirecting.


EXIT STATUS
       non-zero after a rlwrap error, or else command&apos;s exit status. rlwrap will
       always leave the terminal in a tidy state, even after a crash.

FILES
       rlwrap expects its history and completion files in $RLWRAP_HOME, but uses
       .dotfiles  in the user&apos;s home directory if this variable is not set. This
       will quickly become messy if you use rlwrap a lot.

       $RLWRAP_HOME/command_history, ~/.command_history
              History for command

       $RLWRAP_HOME/command_completions, ~/.command_completions
              Per-user completion word list for  command.  rlwrap  never  writes
              into  this list, but one can combine -l and -f options to to simu&#8208;
              late the effect of a -r option that works across invocations.

       /usr/share/rlwrap/completions/command
              System-wide completion word list for command. This  file  is  only
              consulted if the per-user completion word list is not found.

       $INPUTRC, ~/.inputrc
              Individual  readline initialisation file (See readline (3) for its
              format). rlwrap sets its application name to command  (unless  you
              use  the  -C  option), enabling different behaviours for different
              commands.  One could e.g. put the following lines in ~/.inputrc:

                 $if coqtop
                     set show-all-if-ambiguous On
                 $endif

              making rlwrap show all completions whenever it runs coqtop

BUGS and LIMITATIONS
       Though it is flexible, delivers the goods (readline  functionality),  and
       adheres  to the Unix &quot;many small tools&quot; paradigm, rlwrap  is a kludge. It
       cannot know anything about command&apos;s internal  state,  which  makes  con&#8208;
       text-sensitive  completion  impossible.  Using  the readline library from
       within command is still the best option.

       Also, because &quot;it takes two to tango&quot; there is no way for rlwrap to  syn&#8208;
       chronise its internal state with command, resulting in a number of subtle
       race conditions, where e.g. command may have changed  the  state  of  its
       terminal  before  rlwrap  has read command output that was written before
       the state change. You will  notice  these  races  especially  on  a  busy
       machine and with heavy &quot;cooking&quot; and filtering, when suddenly (and unpre&#8208;
       dictably) promtps or command output are garbled or incorrectly coloured.

       Filtering is a very recent addition, and should be considered alpha qual&#8208;
       ity.

       rlwrap  can  try, but often fails to, handle prompts that contain control
       characters.  A flter may be used to clean up the prompt.


VERSION
       This manpage documents rlwrap version 0.37

AUTHORS
       The readline library (written by Chet  Ramey)  does  all  the  hard  work
       behind  the  scenes,  the  pty-handling  code  has been taken practically
       unchanged from rxvt-2.7.10 (currently maintained by Geoff C.  Wing),  and
       completion  word  lists  are  managed  by  Damian  Ivereigh&apos;s libredblack
       library. The few remaining  lines  of  code  were  written  by  Hans  Lub
       (hanslub42@gmail.com).
