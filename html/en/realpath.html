REALPATH(1)                          Debian                          REALPATH(1)



NAME
       realpath - return the canonicalised absolute pathname

SYNOPSIS
       realpath [-s|--strip] [-z|--zero]  filename  ...
       realpath --h|--help
       realpath --v|--version

DESCRIPTION
       realpath  converts  each filename argument to an absolute pathname, which
       has no components that are symbolic links or the special .  or ..  direc&#8208;
       tory entries.  (See realpath(3) for more information.)
       Each  path  component in the filename must exist, otherwise realpath will
       fail and non-zero exit status will be returned.
       Please note that mostly the same functionality is provided  by  the  `-e&apos;
       option of the readlink(1) command.

       When  the -s option is used realpath only removes the .  and ..  directo&#8208;
       ries, but not symbolic links from filename.  If the given filename  argu&#8208;
       ment is relative (i.e.  does not start with `/&apos;), realpath -s prepends to
       it the current directory name as obtained from the getcwd(2) system  call
       before further processing.

       Each  converted  pathname  is  output  to the standard output, on its own
       line.

OPTIONS
       -s, --strip
            Only strip .  and .., components, but do not resolve symbolic links.

       -z, --zero
            Separate output filenames with the null character  instead  of  new&#8208;
            line, so it can be used with the `-0&apos; option of xargs(1).

       -h, --help
            Print short usage information.

       -v, --version
            Show realpath&apos;s version number.

EXAMPLES
       For  the  examples  below  let&apos;s  suppose that /usr/bin/X11 is a symbolic
       link, pointing to directory /usr/bin.

   Example 1
       Regardless of what the current directory is
           realpath /../usr/bin/X11/./xterm
       prints
           /usr/bin/xterm
       but
           realpath -s /../usr/bin/X11/./xterm
       outputs
           /usr/bin/X11/xterm


   Example 2
       When the current directory is /usr/bin/X11 (which  is  still  a  symbolic
       link to /usr/bin), the output of both
           realpath ./xterm
       and
           realpath  -s ./xterm
       will be
           /usr/bin/xterm


   Example 3
       Providing  that  the  current  directory is /home/user (and the directory
       exists before and during the realpath run), the  command
           realpath ../path/to/some/./non-existent/./directory/../or/../file
       will fail with the following error
           ../path/to/some/./non-existent/./directory/../or/../file: No such file or directory
       but
           realpath -s ../path/to/some/./non-existent/./directory/../or/../file
       will return
           /home/path/to/some/non-existent/file

EXIT STATUS
       realpath returns a zero exit code when all  pathnames  were  successfully
       converted.
       In  case  of  any  errors (e.g. missing or unavailable directories in the
       path), realpath prints error message to stderr  and  returns  a  non-zero
       exit code.
