RECNO(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   RECNO(3)



NAME
       recno - record number database access method

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;db.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       Note well: This page documents interfaces provided in glibc up until ver&#8208;
       sion 2.1.  Since version 2.2, glibc no longer provides these  interfaces.
       Probably,  you  are  looking  for  the APIs provided by the libdb library
       instead.

       The routine dbopen(3) is the library interface to database files.  One of
       the  supported file formats is record number files.  The general descrip&#8208;
       tion of the database access methods is in  dbopen(3),  this  manual  page
       describes only the recno specific information.

       The  record  number  data  structure  is  either variable or fixed-length
       records stored in a flat-file format, accessed by the logical record num&#8208;
       ber.   The  existence  of  record  number  five  implies the existence of
       records one through four, and the deletion of record  number  one  causes
       record number five to be renumbered to record number four, as well as the
       cursor, if positioned after record number one, to shift down one record.

       The recno access method specific data structure provided to dbopen(3)  is
       defined in the &lt;db.h&gt; include file as follows:

           typedef struct {
               unsigned long flags;
               unsigned int  cachesize;
               unsigned int  psize;
               int           lorder;
               size_t        reclen;
               unsigned char bval;
               char         *bfname;
           } RECNOINFO;

       The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

       flags  The flag value is specified by ORing any of the following values:

              R_FIXEDLEN
                     The  records  are  fixed-length,  not  byte delimited.  The
                     structure  element  reclen  specifies  the  length  of  the
                     record,  and  the structure element bval is used as the pad
                     character.  Any records, inserted into the  database,  that
                     are less than reclen bytes long are automatically padded.

              R_NOKEY
                     In  the  interface  specified  by dbopen(3), the sequential
                     record retrieval fills in both the caller&apos;s  key  and  data
                     structures.   If  the R_NOKEY flag is specified, the cursor
                     routines are not required to fill  in  the  key  structure.
                     This permits applications to retrieve records at the end of
                     files without reading all of the intervening records.

              R_SNAPSHOT
                     This flag requires that a snapshot of  the  file  be  taken
                     when dbopen(3) is called, instead of permitting any unmodi&#8208;
                     fied records to be read from the original file.
&#12;       cachesize
              A suggested maximum size, in bytes, of  the  memory  cache.   This
              value  is  only advisory, and the access method will allocate more
              memory rather than fail.  If cachesize is  0 (no  size  is  speci&#8208;
              fied) a default cache is used.

       psize  The recno access method stores the in-memory copies of its records
              in a btree.  This value is the size (in bytes) of the  pages  used
              for nodes in that tree.  If psize is 0 (no page size is specified)
              a page size is chosen based on  the  underlying  file  system  I/O
              block size.  See btree(3) for more information.

       lorder The  byte order for integers in the stored database metadata.  The
              number should represent the order as an integer; for example,  big
              endian  order would be the number 4,321.  If lorder is 0 (no order
              is specified) the current host order is used.

       reclen The length of a fixed-length record.

       bval   The delimiting byte to be used to mark the end  of  a  record  for
              variable-length  records,  and  the pad character for fixed-length
              records.  If no value is specified, newlines (&quot;\n&quot;)  are  used  to
              mark  the  end of variable-length records and fixed-length records
              are padded with spaces.

       bfname The recno access method stores the in-memory copies of its records
              in  a  btree.  If bfname is non-NULL, it specifies the name of the
              btree file, as if specified as the filename for a dbopen(3)  of  a
              btree file.

       The data part of the key/data pair used by the recno access method is the
       same as other access methods.  The key is different.  The data  field  of
       the  key  should  be  a  pointer to a memory location of type recno_t, as
       defined in th &lt;db.h&gt; include file.  This type  is  normally  the  largest
       unsigned  integral  type available to the implementation.  The size field
       of the key should be the size of that type.

       Because there can be no metadata associated  with  the  underlying  recno
       access  method files, any changes made to the default values (e.g., fixed
       record length or byte separator value) must be explicitly specified  each
       time the file is opened.

       In  the interface specified by dbopen(3), using the put interface to cre&#8208;
       ate a new record will cause the creation of multiple,  empty  records  if
       the  record  number is more than one greater than the largest record cur&#8208;
       rently in the database.

ERRORS
       The recno access method routines may fail and set errno for  any  of  the
       errors specified for the library routine dbopen(3) or the following:

       EINVAL An  attempt  was  made  to add a record to a fixed-length database
              that was too large to fit.

BUGS
       Only big and little endian byte order is supported.
