RECODE(1)                              FSF                             RECODE(1)



NAME
       recode - converts files between character sets

SYNOPSIS
       recode [OPTION]... [ [CHARSET] | REQUEST [FILE]... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Free `recode&apos; converts files between various character sets and surfaces.

       If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it is mandatory for
       the equivalent short option also.  Similarly for optional arguments.

   Listings:
       -l, --list[=FORMAT]
              list one or all known charsets and aliases

       -k, --known=PAIRS
              restrict charsets according to known PAIRS list

       -h, --header[=[LN/]NAME]
              write table NAME on stdout using LN, then exit

       -F, --freeze-tables
              write out a C module holding all tables

       -T, --find-subsets
              report all charsets being subset of others

       -C, --copyright
              display Copyright and copying conditions

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Operation modes:
       -v, --verbose
              explain sequence of steps and report progress

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              inhibit messages about irreversible recodings

       -f, --force
              force recodings even when not reversible

       -t, --touch
              touch the recoded files after replacement

       -i, --sequence=files
              use intermediate files for sequencing passes

       --sequence=memory
              use memory buffers for sequencing passes

       -p, --sequence=pipe
              use pipe machinery for sequencing passes

   Fine tuning:
       -s, --strict
              use strict mappings, even loose characters
&#12;       -d, --diacritics
              convert only diacritics or alike for HTML/LaTeX

       -S, --source[=LN]
              limit recoding to strings and comments as for LN

       -c, --colons
              use colons instead of double quotes for diaeresis

       -g, --graphics
              approximate IBMPC rulers by ASCII graphics

       -x, --ignore=CHARSET
              ignore CHARSET while choosing a recoding path

       Option -l with no FORMAT nor CHARSET list  available  charsets  and  sur&#8208;
       faces.   FORMAT is `decimal&apos;, `octal&apos;, `hexadecimal&apos; or `full&apos; (or one of
       `dohf&apos;).  Unless DEFAULT_CHARSET is set in environment, CHARSET  defaults
       to  the  locale dependent encoding, determined by LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG.
       With -k, possible before charsets are listed for the given after CHARSET,
       both    being    tabular    charsets,    with    PAIRS    of   the   form
       `BEF1:AFT1,BEF2:AFT2,...&apos;  and BEFs and AFTs being  codes  are  given  as
       decimal numbers.  LN is some language, it may be `c&apos;, `perl&apos; or `po&apos;; `c&apos;
       is the default.

       REQUEST is SUBREQUEST[,SUBREQUEST]...;  SUBREQUEST  is  ENCODING[..ENCOD&#8208;
       ING]...   ENCODING  is [CHARSET][/[SURFACE]]...; REQUEST often looks like
       BEFORE..AFTER, with BEFORE and AFTER being charsets.  An omitted  CHARSET
       implies  the  usual  charset;  an omitted [/SURFACE]... means the implied
       surfaces for CHARSET; a / with an empty surface name means no surfaces at
       all.  See the manual.

       If  none  of  -i  and -p are given, presume -p if no FILE, else -i.  Each
       FILE is recoded over itself, destroying the  original.   If  no  FILE  is
       specified, then act as a filter and recode stdin to stdout.
