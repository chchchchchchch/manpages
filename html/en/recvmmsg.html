RECVMMSG(2)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                RECVMMSG(2)



NAME
       recvmmsg - receive multiple messages on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int recvmmsg(int sockfd, struct mmsghdr *msgvec, unsigned int vlen,
                    unsigned int flags, struct timespec *timeout);

DESCRIPTION
       The  recvmmsg() system call is an extension of recvmsg(2) that allows the
       caller to receive multiple messages from a socket using a  single  system
       call.   (This has performance benefits for some applications.)  A further
       extension over recvmsg(2) is support for a timeout on the receive  opera&#8208;
       tion.

       The  sockfd argument is the file descriptor of the socket to receive data
       from.

       The msgvec argument is a pointer to an array of mmsghdr structures.   The
       size of this array is specified in vlen.

       The mmsghdr structure is defined in &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; as:

           struct mmsghdr {
               struct msghdr msg_hdr;  /* Message header */
               unsigned int  msg_len;  /* Number of received bytes for header */
           };

       The msg_hdr field is a msghdr structure, as described in recvmsg(2).  The
       msg_len field is the number of bytes returned  for  the  message  in  the
       entry.   This  field  has  the same value as the return value of a single
       recvmsg(2) on the header.

       The flags argument contains flags ORed together.  The flags are the  same
       as documented for recvmsg(2), with the following addition:

       MSG_WAITFORONE
              Turns on MSG_DONTWAIT after the first message has been received.

       The  timeout  argument points to a struct timespec (see clock_gettime(2))
       defining a timeout (seconds plus nanoseconds) for the receive  operation.
       (This  interval  will  be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and
       kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a
       small  amount.)   If  timeout  is  NULL then the operation blocks indefi&#8208;
       nitely.

       A blocking recvmmsg() call blocks until vlen messages have been  received
       or  until the timeout expires.  A nonblocking call reads as many messages
       as are available (up to the limit specified by vlen) and returns  immedi&#8208;
       ately.

       On  return  from recvmmsg(), successive elements of msgvec are updated to
       contain information about each received  message:  msg_len  contains  the
       size  of  the  received  message; the subfields of msg_hdr are updated as
       described in recvmsg(2).  The return value of the call indicates the num&#8208;
       ber of elements of msgvec that have been updated.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, recvmmsg() returns the number of messages received in msgvec;
       on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Errors are as for recvmsg(2).   In  addition,  the  following  error  can
       occur:

       EINVAL timeout is invalid.

VERSIONS
       The  recvmmsg()  system call was added in Linux 2.6.32.  Support in glibc
       was added in version 2.12.

CONFORMING TO
       recvmmsg() is Linux-specific.
