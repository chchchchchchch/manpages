regdbdump(8)                          Linux                         regdbdump(8)



NAME
       regdbdump - parse and print out regulatory rules file

SYNOPSIS
       regdbdump &lt;path-to-regulatory.bin&gt;





Description
       regdbdump can be used to parse the regulatory.bin file, the Linux wire&#8208;
       less regulatory database used by crda, and print out its contents in
       human readable format.  regdbdump will return non zero if the digital
       signature regdbdump was built with cannot verify the signature of the
       regulatory database.  Should this happen unintentionally chances are your
       regulatory.bin file is corrupted or has been tampered with.
