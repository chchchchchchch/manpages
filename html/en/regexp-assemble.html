NAME
       regexp-assemble - Assemble a list of regular expressions from a file

SYNOPSIS
         regexp-assemble -abcdfinprsStTuUvw file [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Assemble a list of regular expression either from standard input or a
       file, using the Regexp::Assemble module.

OPTIONS
       -a   look Ahead. Insert &quot;(?=...)&quot; zero-width lookahead assertions in the
            pattern, where necessary.

       -b   Blank. Ignore blank lines.

       -c   Comment. Basic comment filtering. Strip off perl/shell comments
            (&quot;\s*#.*$/&quot;).

       -d   Debug. Turns on debugging output. See Regexp::Assemble for suitable
            values.

       -i   Indent. Print the regular expression using and indent of n to
            display nesting. A.k.a pretty-printing. Implies -p.

       -n   No newline. Do not print a newline after the pattern. Useful when
            interpolating the output into a templating system or similar.

       -p   Print. Print the pattern. This is the default, however, it is
            required when the -t switch is enabled (because if you want to test
            patterns ordinarily you don&apos;t care what the the assembled pattern
            looks like).

       -r   Reduce. The default behaviour is to reduce the assembled pattern.
            Enabling this switch causes the reduction algorithm to be switched
            off. This can help you determine how much reduction is performed.

              regexp-assemble pattern.file | wc
              # versus
              regexp-assemble -r pattern.file | wc

       -s   Statistics. Print some statistics about the assembled pattern. The
            output is sent to STDERR (in order to allow the generated pattern to
            be redirected elsewhere).

       -S   Statistics only. Like -s, except that the pattern itself is not
            output. Useful with -d 8 to see the time taken.

       -t   Test. Test the assembled expression against the contents of a file.
            Each line is read from the file and is matched against the pattern.
            Lines that fail to match are printed. In other words, no output is
            good output. In this mode of operation, error status is 1 in the
            case of a failure, 0 if all lines matched.

       -T   Time. Print statistics on the time taken to reduce and assemble the
            pattern. (This is merely a lazy person&apos;s synonym for &quot;-d 8&quot;).

       -u   Unique. Carp if duplicate patterns are found.

       -U   Unroll. Transform &quot;a+&quot; et al into &quot;aa*&quot; (which may allow additional
            reductions).
&#12;       -v   Version. Print the version of the regexp-assemble script.

       -w   Word/Whole. When testing the contents of a file with &quot;-t&quot;, bracket
            the expression with &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot; in order to match the whole word or
            line from the file.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Will print out a summary of the problem if an added pattern causes the
       assembly to fail.
