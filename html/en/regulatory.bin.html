NAME
       regulatory.bin - The Linux wireless regulatory database




Description
       regulatory.bin is the file used by the Linux wireless subsystem to keep
       its regulatory database information. It is read by crda upon the Linux
       kernel&apos;s request for regulatory information for a specific ISO / IEC 3166
       alpha2 country code. The regulatory database is kept in a small binary
       format for size and code efficiency. The regulatory.bin file can be
       parsed and read in human format by using the regdbdump command. The regu&#8208;
       latory.bin file should be updated upon regulatory changes or corrections.


Upkeeping
       The regulatory database is maintained by the community as such you are
       encouraged to send any corrections or updates to the linux-wireless mail&#8208;
       ing list: linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org
