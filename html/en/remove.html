REMOVE(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  REMOVE(3)



NAME
       remove - remove a file or directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int remove(const char *pathname);

DESCRIPTION
       remove()  deletes  a  name  from the file system.  It calls unlink(2) for
       files, and rmdir(2) for directories.

       If the removed name was the last link to a file and no processes have the
       file  open, the file is deleted and the space it was using is made avail&#8208;
       able for reuse.

       If the name was the last link to a file, but any processes still have the
       file open, the file will remain in existence until the last file descrip&#8208;
       tor referring to it is closed.

       If the name referred to a symbolic link, the link is removed.

       If the name referred to a socket, FIFO, or device, the name  is  removed,
       but processes which have the object open may continue to use it.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       The errors that occur are those for unlink(2) and rmdir(2).

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Under libc4 and libc5, remove() was an alias  for  unlink(2)  (and  hence
       would not remove directories).

BUGS
       Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can cause the unexpected dis&#8208;
       appearance of files which are still being used.
