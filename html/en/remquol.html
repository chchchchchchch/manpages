REMQUO(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  REMQUO(3)



NAME
       remquo, remquof, remquol - remainder and part of quotient

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double remquo(double x, double y, int *quo);
       float remquof(float x, float y, int *quo);
       long double remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       remquo(), remquof(), remquol():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       These functions compute the remainder and part of the quotient upon divi&#8208;
       sion of x by y.  A few bits of  the  quotient  are  stored  via  the  quo
       pointer.  The remainder is returned as the function result.

       The  value  of  the remainder is the same as that computed by the remain&#8208;
       der(3) function.

       The value stored via the quo pointer has the sign  of  x / y  and  agrees
       with the quotient in at least the low order 3 bits.

       For example, remquo(29.0, 3.0) returns -1.0 and might store 2.  Note that
       the actual quotient might not fit in an integer.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the same value as the analogous  func&#8208;
       tions described in remainder(3).

       If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is an infinity, and y is not a NaN, a domain error occurs, and a NaN
       is returned.

       If y is zero, and x is not a NaN, a domain error occurs,  and  a  NaN  is
       returned.

ERRORS
       See  math_error(7)  for  information on how to determine whether an error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is an infinity or y is 0, and the other argument is not a
       NaN
              An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

       These functions do not set errno.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
