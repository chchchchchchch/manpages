NAME
       rendition - Rendition video driver

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       rendition  is an Xorg driver for Rendition/Micron based video cards.  The
       driver supports following framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (Verite V1000  only),
       16  and  24. Acceleration and multi-head configurations are not supported
       yet, but are work in progress.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The rendition driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on  the  fol&#8208;
       lowing Rendition/Micron chips:

       V1000       Verite V1000 based cards.

       V2100       Verite V2100 based cards. Diamond Stealth II S220 is the only
                   known such card.

       V2200       Verite V2200 based cards.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet names
       may optionally be specified in the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
       override the auto-detection:

           &quot;v1000&quot;, &quot;v2x00&quot;.

       The  driver  will  auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chips. If the amount of memory is detected incorrectly, the actual amount
       of  video  memory should be specified with a VideoRam entry in the config
       file &quot;Device&quot; section.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables use of the hardware cursor. Default: use HW-cursor.

       Option &quot;OverclockMem&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Increases  the  Mem/Sys  clock  to  125MHz/60MHz   from   standard
              110MHz/50MHz.  Default: Not overclocked.

       Option &quot;DacSpeed&quot; &quot;MHz&quot;
              Run  the  memory at a higher clock. Useful on some cards with dis&#8208;
              play glitches at higher resolutions. But adds the risk  to  damage
              the hardware. Use with caution.

       Option &quot;FramebufferWC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              If  writecombine  is  disabled in BIOS, and you add this option in
              configuration file, then the driver will try to request  writecom&#8208;
              bined access to the framebuffer. This can drastically increase the
              performance on unaccelerated server. Requires that  &quot;MTRR&quot;-support
              is  compiled  into  the  OS-kernel.   Default: Disabled for V1000,
              enabled for V2100/V2200.

       Option &quot;NoDDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable probing of DDC-information from your monitor. This  infor&#8208;
              mation  is  not  used yet and is only there for informational pur&#8208;
              poses.  Safe to disable if you experience problems during  startup
              of X-server.  Default: Probe DDC.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              If  this  option  is  enabled, the driver will cause the CPU to do
              each drawing operation first into a shadow frame buffer in  system
              virtual memory and then copy the result into video memory. If this
              option is not active, the CPU will draw directly into  video  mem&#8208;
              ory.   Enabling  this option is beneficial for those systems where
              reading from video memory is, on average, slower than  the  corre&#8208;
              sponding  read/modify/write  operation  in  system virtual memory.
              This is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters, and,  so,  this
              option  is  enabled  by  default  unless  acceleration is enabled.
              Default: Enabled unless acceleration is used.

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot;
              Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.   This  mode  is
              unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.


       Notes  For  the  moment  the driver defaults to not request write-combine
              for any chipset as there has been indications of problems with it.
              Use  Option  &quot;MTRR&quot;  to  let the driver request write-combining of
              memory access on the video board.
