RENICE(1)                        User Commands                       RENICE(1)

NAME
     renice &#8212; alter priority of running processes

SYNOPSIS
     renice [-n] priority [[-p] pid ...] [[-g] pgrp ...] [[-u] user ...]
     renice -h | -v

DESCRIPTION
     Renice alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes.
     The following who parameters are interpreted as process ID&apos;s, process group
     ID&apos;s, or user names.  Renice&apos;ing a process group causes all processes in
     the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.  Renice&apos;ing a
     user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling prior&#8208;
     ity altered.  By default, the processes to be affected are specified by
     their process ID&apos;s.

     Options supported by renice:

     -n, --priority
             The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user.

     -g, --pgrp
             Force who parameters to be interpreted as process group ID&apos;s.

     -u, --user
             Force the who parameters to be interpreted as user names.

     -p, --pid
             Resets the who interpretation to be (the default) process ID&apos;s.

     -v, --version
             Print version.

     -h, --help
             Print help.

     For example,

     renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

     would change the priority of process ID&apos;s 987 and 32, and all processes
     owned by users daemon and root.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority of processes
     they own, and can only monotonically increase their ``nice value&apos;&apos; (for
     security reasons) within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20), unless a nice
     resource limit is set (Linux 2.6.12 and higher).  The super-user may alter
     the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in the range
     PRIO_MIN (-20) to PRIO_MAX.  Useful priorities are: 20 (the affected pro&#8208;
     cesses will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the
     ``base&apos;&apos; scheduling priority), anything negative (to make things go very
     fast).

FILES
     /etc/passwd  to map user names to user ID&apos;s

SEE ALSO
     getpriority(2), setpriority(2)

BUGS
     Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of their own pro&#8208;
     cesses, even if they were the ones that decreased the priorities in the
     first place.
     The Linux kernel (at least version 2.0.0) and linux libc (at least version
     5.2.18) does not agree entirely on what the specifics of the systemcall
     interface to set nice values is.  Thus causes renice to report bogus previ&#8208;
     ous nice values.

HISTORY
     The renice command appeared in 4.0BSD.

AVAILABILITY
     The renice command is part of the util-linux package and is available from
     ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
