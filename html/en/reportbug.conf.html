REPORTBUG.CONF(5)                                              REPORTBUG.CONF(5)



NAME
       reportbug.conf - The configuration file for reportbug

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/reportbug.conf  -  The  configuration  file for reportbug, a program
       designed to report bugs in the Debian distribution

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the layout of the reportbug and querybts  con&#8208;
       figuration  file  and  the  available configuration options.  The default
       location of the file is /etc/reportbug.conf and the options may be  over&#8208;
       riding  in  $HOME/.reportbugrc  (which follows the same format as report&#8208;
       bug.conf).

       Please note that any configuration file has to be a valid UTF-8 document,
       and  not  in a different locale; this is particularly important in situa&#8208;
       tions where localized characters have to be used (like for realname).

FILE FORMAT
       Configuration options can be specified in the form

       option-name option-value

       True/False (boolean) options can be specified as

       boolean-option

       (if it&apos;s present, it&apos;s a True).

       Usually, no-option will disable option if option is boolean.

       Options can be specified in any order.

OPTIONS
       The summary of possible options (in alphabetical order) is as follows:
