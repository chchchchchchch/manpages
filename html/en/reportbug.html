NAME
       reportbug - reports a bug to a debbugs server

SYNOPSIS
       reportbug [options] &lt;package | pseudo-package | absolute-pathname&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       reportbug  is  primarily  designed to report bugs in the Debian distribu&#8208;
       tion; by default, it creates an email to the Debian bug  tracking  system
       at  submit@bugs.debian.org  with  information about the bug you&apos;ve found,
       and makes a carbon copy of the report for you as well.

       Using the --bts option, you can also report bugs to  other  servers  that
       use the Debian bug tracking system, debbugs.

       You  may  specify either a package name or a filename; if you use a file&#8208;
       name, it must either be an absolute filename (so beginning with a  /)  or
       if  you  want  reportbug  to  search  the  system for a filename, see the
       --filename and --path options below. If installed, also dlocate  is  used
       to identify the filename location and thus the package containing it.

       You  can  also specify a pseudo-package; these are used in the Debian bug
       tracking system to track issues that are  not  related  to  one  specific
       package.   Run  reportbug  without any arguments, then enter other at the
       package prompt, to see a list of the most commonly-used pseudo-packages.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long  options
       starting  with  two  dashes  (`--&apos;).   A  summary of options are included
       below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       --version
              Show the version of reportbug and exit.

       -A FILENAME, --attach=FILENAME
              Attach a file to the bug report; both text and  binary  files  are
              acceptable;  this option can be specified multiple times to attach
              several files.  This routine will create a  MIME  attachment  with
              the file included; in some cases (usually text files), it is prob&#8208;
              ably  better  to  use  -i/--include  option.   (Please  note  that
              Debian&apos;s  bug tracking system has limited support for MIME attach&#8208;
              ments.)

              This option supports also globbing  (i.e.  names  with  wildcards,
              like  file.*)  but  remember to include them between single quotes
              (the previous example becomes:  &apos;file.*&apos;)  else  the  shell  would
              expand it before calling reportbug leading to an error.

       -b, --no-query-bts
              Don&apos;t  check the Debian bug tracking system to see if this problem
              has already been reported; useful for offline  use  or  if  you&apos;re
              really sure it&apos;s a bug.

       --query-bts
              Check  the  Debian  bug tracking system to see if this problem has
              already been reported (default).

       -B SYSTEM, --bts=SYSTEM
              Instead of the Debian bug server (or the bug server  specified  in
              /etc/reportbug.conf, use the server specified by SYSTEM.

       --body=BODY
              Use  the specified BODY as the body of the message.  The body text
              will be wrapped at 70 columns, and the  normal  reportbug  headers
              and  footers  will be added as appropriate.  The editor prompt and
              any &quot;special&quot; prompting will be bypassed.

       --body-file=BODYFILE, --bodyfile=BODYFILE
              The contents of the (assumed to be) text  file  BODYFILE  will  be
              used  as  the  message  body.  This file is assumed to be properly
              formatted (i.e. reasonable line lengths, etc.).  The usual headers
              and  footers  will  be  added,  and  the editor step and &quot;special&quot;
              prompts will be skipped.  (BODYFILE may  also  be  a  named  pipe;
              using a device special file may lead to unusual results.)

       -c, --no-config-files
              Omit  configuration  files from the bug report without asking.  By
              default, you are asked if you want to include them; in some cases,
              doing so may cause sensitive information to be sent via email.

       -C CLASS, --class=CLASS
              Specify report class for GNATS BTSes.

       --configure
              Rerun  the reportbug first time configuration routine, and write a
              new $HOME/.reportbugrc file.  This  will  erase  any  pre-existing
              settings  in  the  file;  however,  a  backup  will  be written as
              $HOME/.reportbugrc~.

       --check-available
              Check for newer releases of  the  package  at  packages.debian.org
              (default).  In advanced and expert mode, check incoming.debian.org
              and http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html too.

       --no-check-available
              Do  not  check  for  newer  releases  of  the  package  at   pack&#8208;
              ages.debian.org.

       --debconf
              Include debconf settings in your report.

       --no-debconf
              Do not include debconf settings from your report.

       -d, --debug
              Don&apos;t  send  a  real  bug  report  to  Debian; send it to yourself
              instead.  This is primarily used for testing by the maintainer.

       --test Operate in test mode (maintainer use only).

       --draftpath=DRAFTPATH
              Save the draft (for example, when exiting and  saving  the  report
              without reporting it) into DRAFTPATH directory.

       -e EDITOR, --editor=EDITOR
              Specify  the  editor to use, overriding any EDITOR or VISUAL envi&#8208;
              ronment variable setting.

       --email=ADDRESS
              Set the email address your report should appear to  be  sent  from
              (i.e.  the  address that appears in the From header).  This should
              be the actual Internet email address on its own  (i.e.  without  a
              real  name  or  comment part, like foo@example.com).  This setting
              will override the EMAIL and DEBEMAIL  environment  variables,  but
              not REPORTBUGEMAIL.

       --envelope-from
              Specify the Envelope From mail header (also known as Return-path);
              by default it&apos;s the From address but it can be selected a  differ&#8208;
              ent one in case the MTA doesn&apos;t canonicalize local users to public
              addresses.


       --mbox-reader-cmd=MBOX_READER_CMD
              Specify a command to open the bug reports mbox file. You  can  use
              %s to substitute the mbox file to be used, and %% to insert a lit&#8208;
              eral percent sign. If no %s is specified, the mbox  file  name  is
              supplied at the end of the argument list.

       --exit-prompt
              Display  a  prompt  before exiting; this is useful if reportbug is
              run in a transient terminal (i.e. from its Debian menu entry).

       -f FILENAME, --filename=FILENAME
              Report a bug in the package containing FILENAME so you don&apos;t  have
              to  figure out what package the file belongs to.  The path will be
              searched for an exact  path  for  FILENAME  before  attempting  to
              broaden the search to all files. If dlocate is installed, FILENAME
              is actually a regular expression.

       --from-buildd=BUILDD_FORMAT
              This options is a shortcut for buildd admins to report  bugs  from
              buildd   log;  the  option  expects  a  value  in  the  format  of
              $source_$version where $source is the source package the bug  will
              be reported against and $version is its version.

       --path If  the  -f/--filename  option  is also specified, only search the
              path for the specified FILENAME.  Specifying an absolute path with
              the  -f/--filename  option (i.e. one beginning with a /) overrides
              this behavior.

       -g, --gnupg, --gpg
              Attach a digital signature to the bug report using GnuPG (the  GNU
              Privacy  Guard).   (This argument will be ignored if you are using
              an MUA to edit and send your report.)

       -G, --gnus
              Use the GNUS mail and news reader to send your report, rather than
              using the editor.

       -H HEADER, --header=HEADER
              Add  a custom RFC2822 header to your email; for example, to send a
              carbon copy of the report to  debian-68k@lists.linux-m68k.org  you
              could use -H &apos;X-Debbugs-CC: debian-68k@lists.linux-m68k.org&apos;

       -i FILE, --include=FILE
              Include  the  specified FILE as part of the body of the message to
              be edited.  Can be used multiple  times  to  add  multiple  files;
              text-only please!  From a suggestion by Michael Alan Dorman in the
              bug mailing list.  (See also the -a/--attach option.)

       -I, --no-check-installed
              Do not check whether the package  is  installed  before  filing  a
              report.   This  is generally only useful when filing a report on a
              package you know is not installed on your system.

       --check-installed
              Check if the specified package is installed when  filing  reports.
              (This is the default behavior of reportbug.)

       -j JUSTIFICATION, --justification=JUSTIFICATION
              Bugs  in  Debian  that have serious, grave, or critical severities
              must meet certain criteria to be classified as such.  This  option
              allows  you  to  specify  the justification for a release-critical
              bug, instead of being prompted for it.

       -k, --kudos
              Send appreciative email to the recorded maintainer address, rather
              than  filing  a  bug report.  (You can also send kudos to package&#8208;
              name@packages.debian.org, for packages in the Debian archive; how&#8208;
              ever,  this  option  uses  the Maintainer address from the control
              file, so it works with other package sources too.)

       -K KEYID, --keyid=KEYID
              Private key to use for PGP/GnuPG signatures.   If  not  specified,
              the  first  key  in  the  secret  keyring  that matches your email
              address will be used.

       --latest-first
              Display the bug reports list sorted and with the latest reports at
              the top.

       --license
              Show  reportbug&apos;s  copyright  and  license information on standard
              output.

       --list-cc=ADDRESS
              Send a carbon copy of the report to the  specified  list  after  a
              report number is assigned; this is the equivalent to the option -H
              &apos;X-Debbugs-CC: ADDRESS&apos;.  This option will only work  as  intended
              with debbugs systems.

       -m, --maintonly
              Only send the bug to the package maintainer; the bug tracking sys&#8208;
              tem will not send a copy to the bug report distribution lists.

       --max-attachment-size=MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE
              Specify the maximum size any attachment file can have  (this  also
              include the file for --body-file option). If an attachment file is
              too big, there could be problems in delivering the email (and also
              to  compose  it), so we set a limit to attachment size. By default
              this is 10 megabytes.

       --mirror=MIRRORS
              Add a BTS mirror.

       --mode=MODE
              Set the operating mode for  reportbug.   reportbug  currently  has
              four  operating  modes:  novice (the default), standard, advanced,
              and expert.

              novice mode is designed to minimize prompting  about  things  that
              &quot;ordinary users&quot; would be unlikely to know or care about, shifting
              the triage burden onto the maintainer.  Checking for new  versions
              is only done for the stable distribution in this mode.  It is cur&#8208;
              rently the default mode.

              standard mode includes a relatively large number  of  prompts  and
              tries  to  encourage  users to not file frivolous or duplicate bug
              reports.

              advanced mode is like standard mode,  but  may  include  shortcuts
              suitable for more advanced users of Debian, without being as close
              to the metal (and potential flamage) as expert mode.   (Currently,
              the only differences from standard mode are that it assumes famil&#8208;
              iarity with the &quot;incoming&quot; queue; it allows the reporting of  bugs
              on  &quot;dependency&quot;  packages; and it does not prompt where to insert
              the report text in the editor.)

              expert mode is designed to minimize prompts that are  designed  to
              discourage  frivolous or unnecessary bug reports, &quot;severity infla&#8208;
              tion,&quot; and the like.  In expert mode, reportbug assumes  the  user
              is  thoroughly  familiar  with Debian policies.  In practice, this
              means that reporters are no longer required to justify  setting  a
              high  severity  on a bug report, and certain automated cleanups of
              the message are bypassed.  Individuals who do not  regularly  con&#8208;
              tribute  to  the  Debian project are highly discouraged from using
              expert mode, as it can lead to flamage from maintainers when  used
              improperly.

       -M, --mutt
              Instead  of  spawning  an editor to revise the bug report, use the
              mutt mail reader to edit and send it.

       --mta=MTA
              Specify an  alternate  MTA,  instead  of  /usr/sbin/sendmail  (the
              default).  Any smtphost setting will override this one.

       --mua=MUA
              Instead  of  spawning  an editor to revise the bug report, use the
              specified MUA (mail user agent) to edit and send  it.  --mutt  and
              --nmh options are processed.

       -n, --mh, --nmh
              Instead  of  spawning  an editor to revise the bug report, use the
              comp command (part of the nmh and mh mail  systems)  to  edit  and
              send it.

       -N, --bugnumber
              Run  reportbug  against the specified bug report, useful when fol&#8208;
              lowing-up a bug and its number is already known.

       --no-bug-script
              Do not execute the bug script (if present);  this  option  can  be
              useful  together  with  --template  to  suppress every interactive
              actions, since some bug scripts can ask questions.

       --no-cc-menu
              Don&apos;t display the menu to enter additional addresses (CC).

       --no-tags-menu
              Don&apos;t display the menu to enter additional tags.

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Instead of sending an email, redirect it to  the  specified  file&#8208;
              name.

              The  output  file  is a full dump of the email message, so it con&#8208;
              tains both headers and mail body. If you want to use it as a  tem&#8208;
              plate  to create a new bug report, then you have to remove all the
              headers (mind the Subject one, though) and start the report at the
              Package pseudo-header.

       -O, --offline
              Disable  all  external  queries.  Currently has the same effect as
              --no-check-available --no-query-bts.

       -p, --print
              Instead of sending an email, print the bug report to standard out&#8208;
              put,  so  you can redirect it to a file or pipe it to another pro&#8208;
              gram.

              This option only outputs a template for a bug report (but, differ&#8208;
              ently  from  --template  it&apos;s  more interactive); you will need to
              fill in the long description.

       --paranoid
              Show the contents of the message before it is sent, including  all
              headers.  Automatically disabled if in template mode.

       --no-paranoid
              Don&apos;t  show  the  full  contents  of the message before it is sent
              (default).

       --pgp  Attach a digital signature to the bug  report  using  PGP  (Pretty
              Good  Privacy).   Please note, however, that the Debian project is
              phasing out the use of PGP in favor of GnuPG.  (This argument will
              be ignored if using an MUA to edit and send your report.)
&#12;       --proxy=PROXY, --http_proxy=PROXY
              Specify the WWW proxy server to use to handle the query of the bug
              tracking system.  You should only need this parameter if  you  are
              behind  a  firewall.   The PROXY argument should be formatted as a
              valid HTTP URL, including (if necessary) a port number; for  exam&#8208;
              ple, http://192.168.1.1:3128/.

       -P PSEUDO-HEADER, --pseudo-header=PSEUDO-HEADER
              Add a custom pseudo-header to your report; for example, to add the
              mytag usertag for the user humberto@example.com to  the  bug,  you
              could use -P &apos;User: humberto@example.com&apos; -P &apos;Usertags: mytag&apos;.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress diagnostic messages to standard error.

       -Q, --query-only
              Do not submit a bug report; just query the BTS.  Option ignored if
              you specify --no-bts-query.

       --query-source
              Query on all binary packages built by the same  source,  not  just
              the binary package specified.

       --no-query-source
              Only query on the binary package specified on the command line.

       --realname=NAME
              Set the real name (human-readable name) to use for your report.

       --report-quiet
              Register  the  bug  in  the  bug tracking system, but don&apos;t send a
              report to the package maintainer or anyone else.   Don&apos;t  do  this
              unless  you&apos;re  the  maintainer of the package in question, or you
              really know what you are doing.

       --reply-to=ADDRESS, --replyto=ADDRESS
              Set the Reply-To address header in your report.

       -s SUBJECT, --subject=SUBJECT
              Set the subject of the bug report (i.e. a brief explanation of the
              problem,  less  than  60  characters).  If you do not specify this
              switch, you will be prompted for a subject.

       -S SEVERITY, --severity=SEVERITY
              Specify a severity level, from critical,  grave,  serious,  impor&#8208;
              tant, normal, minor, and wishlist.

       --smtphost=HOST[:PORT]
              Use  the  mail  transport agent (MTA) at HOST to send your report,
              instead of your local  /usr/sbin/sendmail  program.   This  should
              generally  be  your  ISP&apos;s  outgoing mail server; you can also use
              &apos;localhost&apos; if you have a working  mail  server  running  on  your
              machine.  If the PORT is omitted, the standard port for SMTP, port
              25, is used.

       --timeout=SECONDS
              Specify the network timeout, the number of seconds to wait  for  a
              resource to respond. If nothing is specified, a default timeout of
              1 minute is selected.

              In case of a network error, there are chances it&apos;s due  to  a  too
              low  timeout: try passing the --timeout option with a higher value
              than default.

       --tls  If using SMTP, use Transport Layer Security  (TLS)  encryption  to
              secure  the  connection to the mail server.  Some SMTP servers may
              require this option.

       --smtpuser=USERNAME
              If using SMTP, use the specified USERNAME for authentication.
&#12;       --smtppasswd=PASSWORD
              If using SMTP, use the specified PASSWORD for authentication.   If
              the password isn&apos;t specified on the command line or in the config&#8208;
              uration file, a prompt will be displayed asking for it.

              Use of this option is insecure on multiuser systems.  Instead, you
              should set this option in $HOME/.reportbugrc and ensure it is only
              readable by your user (e.g. with chmod 600 $HOME/.reportbugrc).

       --src, --source
              Specify to report the bug against the source package, and not  the
              binary package (default behaviour).

       -t TYPE, --type=TYPE
              Specify  the  type  of  report  to be submitted; currently accepts
              either gnats or debbugs.

       -T TAG, --tag=TAG
              Specify a tag to be filed on this report, for example --tag=patch.
              Multiple tags can be specified using multiple -T/--tag arguments.

              Alternatively,  you  can specify the &apos;tag&apos; none to bypass the tags
              prompt without specifying any tags; this will also ignore any tags
              specified on the command line.

       --template
              Output  a  template  report  to  standard output. Differently from
              -p/--print, it tries to be not interactive, and  presents  a  tem&#8208;
              plate without user&apos;s input.

       -u INTERFACE, --interface=INTERFACE, --ui=INTERFACE
              Specify the user interface to use.  Valid options are text, urwid,
              and gtk2; default is taken from the reportbug configuration files.

       -v, --verify
              Verify the integrity of the package (if installed)  using  debsums
              before reporting.

       --no-verify
              Do not verify the integrity of the package with debsums.

       -V VERSION, --package-version=VERSION
              Specify the version of the package the problem was found in.  This
              is probably most useful if you are reporting a bug  in  a  package
              that is not installable or installed on a different system.

       -x, --no-cc
              Don&apos;t send a blind carbon copy (BCC) of the bug report to the sub&#8208;
              mitter (i.e. yourself).

       -z, --no-compress
              Don&apos;t compress configuration files by removing comments and  blank
              lines.

EXAMPLES
       reportbug lynx-ssl
              Report a bug in the lynx-ssl package.

       reportbug --path --filename=ls
              Report  a  bug in the installed package that includes a program in
              your path called ls.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       From version 0.22 on, reportbug has supported a simple run  control  file
       syntax.   Commands are read from /etc/reportbug.conf and $HOME/.reportbu&#8208;
       grc with commands in the latter overriding those in the former.

       Commands are not case sensitive, and currently  take  0  or  1  argument;
       arguments containing whitespace must be enclosed in quotes.

       Any line starting with # is taken to be a comment and will be ignored.

       Generally,  options  corresponding  to the long options for reportbug are
       supported, without leading -- sequences.  See reportbug.conf(5)  for  all
       acceptable options and detailed information.

ENVIRONMENT
       VISUAL Editor to use for editing your bug report.

       EDITOR Editor to use for editing the bug report (overridden by VISUAL).

       REPORTBUGEMAIL, EMAIL, DEBEMAIL
              Email  address  to use as your from address (in this order). If no
              environment variable exists, the default is taken from  your  user
              name and /etc/mailname.

       DEBFULLNAME, DEBNAME, NAME
              Real name to use; default is taken from /etc/passwd.

       REPLYTO
              Address for Reply-To header in outgoing mail.

       MAILCC Use the specified CC address on your email.  Note you can also use
              the -H option for this (and for Bcc&apos;s too).

       MAILBCC
              Use the specified BCC address, instead of your email address.  (CC
              and BCC based on suggestions from Herbert Thielen in the bug wish&#8208;
              list).

       http_proxy
              Provides the address of a proxy server to handle  the  BTS  query.
              This  should be a valid http URL for a proxy server, including any
              required port number (simply specifying a hostname, or omitting  a
              port other than 80, WILL NOT WORK).

NOTES
       reportbug  should probably be compatible with other bug tracking systems,
       like bugzilla (used by the GNOME  and  Mozilla  projects)  and  jitterbug
       (used by Samba, AbiSource and FreeCiv) but it isn&apos;t.
