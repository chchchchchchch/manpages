EPSTOPDF(1)                                                          EPSTOPDF(1)



NAME
       epstopdf, repstopdf - convert an EPS file to PDF

SYNOPSIS
       epstopdf [options] [epsfile]

DESCRIPTION
       epstopdf transforms the Encapsulated PostScript file epsfile (or standard
       input) so that it is guaranteed to start at the 0,0  coordinate,  and  it
       sets  a  page  size exactly corresponding to the BoundingBox.  This means
       that when Ghostscript renders it, the result needs no cropping,  and  the
       PDF  MediaBox is correct.  By default, the result is piped to Ghostscript
       and a PDF version written.

       If the bounding box is not right, of course, there are problems.

OPTIONS
       --outfile=file
              write result to file.  If this option is not given, and --nogs  or
              --filter  is  specified,  write to standard output; otherwise, the
              default is to construct the output  file  name  by  replacing  any
              extension in the input file with .pdf.

       --[no]compress
              use compression (default: on).

       --[no]debug
              write debugging info (default: off).

       --[no]embed
              embed fonts (default: on).

       --[no]exact
              scan ExactBoundingBox (default: off).

       --[no]filter
              read standard input and (unless --outfile is given) write standard
              output(default: off).

       --[no]gs
              run Ghostscript (default: on).  With --nogs, output  (to  standard
              output  by  default)  the  PostScript  that would normally be con&#8208;
              verted; that is, the input PostScript as modified by epstopdf.

       --[no]hires
              scan HiresBoundingBox (default: off).

       --gscmd=val
              pipe output to val (default: [gswin32c on Windows, else gs])

       --res=dpi
              set image resolution (default: [use gs default])

       --autorotate=val
              set AutoRotatePages (default: None); recognized val choices: None,
              All, PageByPage.  For EPS files, PageByPage is equivalent to All.

       --restricted=val
              turn  on  restricted mode (default: [on for repstopdf, else off]);
              this forbids the use of --gscmd and imposes  restrictions  on  the
              input  and output file names according to the values of openin_any
              and openout_any (see the Web2c manual, http://tug.org/web2c).

       --help display help message and exit

       --version
              display version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       Examples which produce &quot;test.pdf&quot;:
       epstopdf test.eps
       produce postscript | epstopdf --filter &gt;test.pdf
       produce postscript | epstopdf -f -d -o=test.pdf
       Example: look for HiresBoundingBox and produce corrected PostScript:
       epstopdf -d --nogs --hires test.ps &gt;testcorr.ps

BUGS
       The case of &quot;%%BoundingBox: (atend)&quot; when input is  not  seekable  (e.g.,
       from a pipe) is not supported.

       Report  bugs  in  the  program  or  this man page to tex-k@tug.org.  When
       reporting bugs, please include an input file and the command line options
       specified, so the problem can be reproduced.
