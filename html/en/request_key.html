REQUEST_KEY(2)             Linux Key Management Calls             REQUEST_KEY(2)



NAME
       request_key - request a key from the kernel&apos;s key management facility

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;

       key_serial_t request_key(const char *type, const char *description,
                                const char *callout_info,
                                key_serial_t keyring);

DESCRIPTION
       request_key()  asks  the  kernel  to  find  a  key of the given type that
       matches the specified description and, if successful, to attach it to the
       nominated keyring and to return its serial number.

       request_key() first recursively searches all the keyrings attached to the
       calling process in the order  thread-specific  keyring,  process-specific
       keyring and then session keyring for a matching key.

       If  request_key()  is  called  from a program invoked by request_key() on
       behalf of some other process to generate a key, then the keyrings of that
       other process will be searched next, using that other process&apos;s UID, GID,
       groups and security context to control access.

       The keys in each keyring searched are checked  for  a  match  before  any
       child  keyrings are recursed into.  Only keys that are searchable for the
       caller may be found, and only searchable keyrings may be searched.

       If the key is not found then, if callout_info is set, this function  will
       attempt  to  look  further  afield.   In such a case, the callout_info is
       passed to a user-space service such as /sbin/request-key to generate  the
       key.

       If  that is unsuccessful also, then an error will be returned, and a tem&#8208;
       porary negative key will be installed in  the  nominated  keyring.   This
       will  expire  after  a  few  seconds,  but will cause subsequent calls to
       request_key() to fail until it does.

       The keyring serial number may be that of a valid  keyring  to  which  the
       caller has write permission, or it may be a special keyring ID:

       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller&apos;s thread-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller&apos;s process-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller&apos;s session-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller&apos;s UID-specific keyring.

       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller&apos;s UID-session keyring.

       If  a  key  is  created, no matter whether it&apos;s a valid key or a negative
       key, it will displace any other key of the same type and description from
       the destination keyring.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success  request_key() returns the serial number of the key it found.
       On error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have been  set  to
       an appropriate error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The keyring wasn&apos;t available for modification by the user.

       EINTR  The request was interrupted by a signal.

       EDQUOT The key quota for this user would be exceeded by creating this key
              or linking it to the keyring.

       EKEYEXPIRED
              An expired key was found, but no replacement could be obtained.

       EKEYREJECTED
              The attempt to generate a new key was rejected.

       EKEYREVOKED
              A revoked key was found, but no replacement could be obtained.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to create a key.

       ENOKEY No matching key was found.

LINKING
       Although this is a Linux system call, it is not present in libc  but  can
       be found rather in libkeyutils.  When linking, -lkeyutils should be spec&#8208;
       ified to the linker.
