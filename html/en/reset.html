tset(1)                                                                  tset(1)



NAME
       tset, reset - terminal initialization

SYNOPSIS
       tset [-IQVcqrsw] [-] [-e ch] [-i ch] [-k ch] [-m mapping] [terminal]
       reset [-IQVcqrsw] [-] [-e ch] [-i ch] [-k ch] [-m mapping] [terminal]

DESCRIPTION
       Tset  initializes  terminals.  Tset first determines the type of terminal
       that you are using.  This determination is done  as  follows,  using  the
       first terminal type found.

       1. The terminal argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the TERM environmental variable.

       3.  (BSD  systems  only.)  The terminal type associated with the standard
       error output device in the /etc/ttys file.  (On System-V-like UNIXes  and
       systems  using  that  convention,  getty  does  this  job by setting TERM
       according to the type passed to it by /etc/inittab.)

       4. The default terminal type, ``unknown&apos;&apos;.

       If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the -m option
       mappings are then applied (see the section TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING for more
       information).  Then, if the terminal type begins  with  a  question  mark
       (``?&apos;&apos;),  the user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal type.  An
       empty response confirms the type, or, another  type  can  be  entered  to
       specify a new type.  Once the terminal type has been determined, the ter&#8208;
       minfo entry for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminfo entry is found
       for the type, the user is prompted for another terminal type.

       Once  the terminfo entry is retrieved, the window size, backspace, inter&#8208;
       rupt and line kill characters (among many other things) are set  and  the
       terminal  and  tab  initialization strings are sent to the standard error
       output.  Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill  characters  have
       changed,  or  are  not set to their default values, their values are dis&#8208;
       played to the standard error output.  Use the -c or -w option  to  select
       only  the  window  sizing  versus  the  other initialization.  If neither
       option is given, both are assumed.

       When invoked as reset, tset sets cooked and echo modes, turns off  cbreak
       and  raw modes, turns on newline translation and resets any unset special
       characters to their default values before doing the terminal  initializa&#8208;
       tion described above.  This is useful after a program dies leaving a ter&#8208;
       minal in an abnormal state.  Note, you may have to type

           &lt;LF&gt;reset&lt;LF&gt;

       (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get  the  terminal  to
       work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state.  Also,
       the terminal will often not echo the command.

       The options are as follows:

       -c   Set control characters and modes.  -e Set the erase character to ch.

       -I   Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the termi&#8208;
            nal.

       -i   Set the interrupt character to ch.
&#12;       -k   Set the line kill character to ch.

       -m   Specify  a  mapping from a port type to a terminal.  See the section
            TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING for more information.

       -Q   Do not display any values for the erase,  interrupt  and  line  kill
            characters.   Normally  tset displays the values for control charac&#8208;
            ters which differ from the system&apos;s default values.

       -q   The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the  ter&#8208;
            minal  is  not  initialized in any way.  The option `-&apos; by itself is
            equivalent but archaic.

       -r   Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

       -s   Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize  the  environment
            variable  TERM  to the standard output.  See the section SETTING THE
            ENVIRONMENT for details.

       -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this  program,  and
            exits.

       -w   Resize the window to match the size deduced via setupterm.  Normally
            this has no effect, unless setupterm is not able to detect the  win&#8208;
            dow size.

       The  arguments  for  the  -e, -i, and -k options may either be entered as
       actual characters or by using the `hat&apos; notation, i.e., control-h may  be
       specified as ``^H&apos;&apos; or ``^h&apos;&apos;.

SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT
       It  is  often  desirable to enter the terminal type and information about
       the terminal&apos;s capabilities into the shell&apos;s environment.  This  is  done
       using the -s option.

       When  the  -s  option is specified, the commands to enter the information
       into the shell&apos;s environment are written to the standard output.  If  the
       SHELL  environmental  variable ends in ``csh&apos;&apos;, the commands are for csh,
       otherwise, they are for sh.  Note, the csh commands  set  and  unset  the
       shell  variable  noglob,  leaving  it  unset.   The following line in the
       .login or .profile files will initialize the environment correctly:

           eval `tset -s options ... `

TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
       When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current system
       information  is  incorrect)  the terminal type derived from the /etc/ttys
       file or the TERM environmental variable is often something  generic  like
       network, dialup, or unknown.  When tset is used in a startup script it is
       often desirable to provide information about the type of terminal used on
       such ports.

       The  purpose  of the -m option is to map from some set of conditions to a
       terminal type, that is, to tell tset ``If I&apos;m on this port at a  particu&#8208;
       lar speed, guess that I&apos;m on that kind of terminal&apos;&apos;.

       The  argument  to  the  -m  option  consists of an optional port type, an
       optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional colon
       (``:&apos;&apos;) character and a terminal type.  The port type is a string (delim&#8208;
       ited by either the operator or the colon character).  The operator may be
       any  combination  of  ``&gt;&apos;&apos;, ``&lt;&apos;&apos;, ``@&apos;&apos;, and ``!&apos;&apos;; ``&gt;&apos;&apos; means greater
       than, ``&lt;&apos;&apos; means less than, ``@&apos;&apos; means equal to and ``!&apos;&apos;  inverts  the
       sense  of  the  test.  The baud rate is specified as a number and is com&#8208;
       pared with the speed of the standard error output (which  should  be  the
       control terminal).  The terminal type is a string.
&#12;       If  the  terminal  type is not specified on the command line, the -m map&#8208;
       pings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and  baud  rate
       match  the  mapping,  the terminal type specified in the mapping replaces
       the current type.  If more than  one  mapping  is  specified,  the  first
       applicable mapping is used.

       For example, consider the following mapping: dialup&gt;9600:vt100.  The port
       type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification is  9600,
       and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of this mapping is to specify
       that if the terminal type is dialup, and the baud rate  is  greater  than
       9600 baud, a terminal type of vt100 will be used.

       If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any baud rate.
       If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any port type.
       For  example,  -m  dialup:vt100  -m  :?xterm  will cause any dialup port,
       regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and  any  non-
       dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm.  Note, because of the
       leading question mark, the user will be queried on a default port  as  to
       whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.

       No  whitespace characters are permitted in the -m option argument.  Also,
       to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that  the  entire
       -m option argument be placed within single quote characters, and that csh
       users insert a backslash character (``\&apos;&apos;) before any  exclamation  marks
       (``!&apos;&apos;).

HISTORY
       The  tset  command  appeared  in BSD 3.0.  The ncurses implementation was
       lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources for  a  terminfo  environment  by
       Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  tset  utility  has been provided for backward-compatibility with BSD
       environments (under most modern UNIXes, /etc/inittab and getty(1) can set
       TERM  appropriately  for each dial-up line; this obviates what was tset&apos;s
       most important use).  This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD tset,  with
       a few exceptions specified here.

       The  -S option of BSD tset no longer works; it prints an error message to
       stderr and dies.  The -s option only sets TERM, not TERMCAP.  Both  these
       changes  are  because  the  TERMCAP variable is no longer supported under
       terminfo-based ncurses, which makes tset -S useless (we made it die nois&#8208;
       ily rather than silently induce lossage).

       There  was  an  undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking tset via a link
       named `TSET` (or via any other name beginning with an upper-case  letter)
       set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been omitted.

       The  -A,  -E, -h, -u and -v options were deleted from the tset utility in
       4.4BSD.  None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all  are  of  limited
       utility at best.  The -a, -d, and -p options are similarly not documented
       or useful, but were retained as they appear to be in widespread use.   It
       is  strongly recommended that any usage of these three options be changed
       to use the -m option instead.  The -n option remains, but has no  effect.
       The -adnp options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.

       It  is  still  permissible  to specify the -e, -i, and -k options without
       arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage  be  fixed
       to explicitly specify the character.

       As  of  4.4BSD,  executing tset as reset no longer implies the -Q option.
       Also, the interaction between the - option and the terminal  argument  in
       some historic implementations of tset has been removed.

ENVIRONMENT
       The tset command uses these environment variables:
&#12;       SHELL
            tells tset whether to initialize TERM using sh or csh syntax.

       TERM Denotes  your terminal type.  Each terminal type is distinct, though
            many are similar.

       TERMCAP
            may denote the location of a termcap database.   If  it  is  not  an
            absolute  pathname,  e.g., begins with a `/&apos;, tset removes the vari&#8208;
            able from the environment before looking for the  terminal  descrip&#8208;
            tion.

FILES
       /etc/ttys
            system  port  name  to  terminal type mapping database (BSD versions
            only).

       /etc/terminfo
