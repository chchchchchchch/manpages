NAME
       resgen, resgen2 - Mono/CLI Resource Generator

SYNOPSIS
       resgen source.ext [dest.ext]

       resgen /compile source.ext[,dest.resources] [...]

       resgen2

DESCRIPTION
       Convert a resource file from one format to another.

       The currently supported formats are text, resources, resx and po.

       .txt, .text

              Used  to process text files, the format of the text file is of the
              form:

                   key=value

              The value argument can contain special characters as long as  they
              are  escaped.    The  escape sequences currently supported are \n,
              \r, \t, \\ (to get the escape sequence itself)  and  with  resgen2
              unicode  escape  sequences  are  supported  with the \uXXXX escape
              sequence, where XXXX is a four digit number.

              Lines that start with the # or ; character are considered comments
              and ignored.

       &apos;.resources&apos;

              This   is   the   binary  file  format  implemented  by  the  Sys&#8208;
              tem.Resources.ResourceReader class, part of mscorlib.dll

       &apos;.resx&apos;

              This  is  the  binary  file  format  implemented   by   the   Sys&#8208;
              tem.Resources.ResXResourceReader class.  This class is not part of
              mscorlib.dll, this class is part of System.Windows.Forms.

       &apos;.po&apos;.

              PO files are the source files used by the Unix gettext infrastruc&#8208;
              ture that is typically used to internationalize applications.

              Lines starting with the &apos;#&apos; character are comment lines.

              The file contains many instance of strings like this:

                   msgid KEY
                   msgstr VALUE

              The  KEY is typically the string to translate and the VALUE is the
              translation.  On PO files instead of using codes as the KEY (as it
              is  customary with resource files) the KEY is typically a complete
              english message that applications embed in their source  code  and
              will be used as a fallback if no translation resources are used.

              Since  resources  are key value pairs, the extended features in PO
              files are not supported (plurals and support for N-cases).

              To learn more about the po file format, use your info browser  and
              point it to the &quot;(gettext)PO Files&quot; node.

       If the destination file is not specified, source.resources will be used.

       The /compile option takes a list of .resX or .txt files to convert to the
       output file name.

OPTIONS
       -compile

              This switch instructs resgen to compile multiple files.   It  must
              appear before any resources are specified on the command line.

       -usesourcepath

              This option is only available for resgen2, and it instructs resgen
              to resolve relative paths using the directory of the resx file  as
              current directory.

FILES
       This  program  will  load  referenced  assemblies  from the Mono assembly
       cache.
