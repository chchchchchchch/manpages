RESIZE(1)                                                              RESIZE(1)



NAME
       resize  -  set  environment and terminal settings to current xterm window
       size

SYNOPSIS
       resize [ -u | -c ] [ -s [ row col ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Resize prints a shell command for  setting  the  appropriate  environment
       variables  to  indicate  the  current size of xterm window from which the
       command is run.  For this output to take effect, resize  must  either  be
       evaluated as part of the command line (usually done with a shell alias or
       function) or else redirected to a file which can then be read  in.   From
       the  C  shell  (usually  known as /bin/csh), the following alias could be
       defined in the user&apos;s .cshrc:

               %  alias rs &apos;set noglob; eval `resize`&apos;

       After resizing the window, the user would type:

               %  rs

       Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually  known  as  /bin/sh)  that
       don&apos;t  have command functions will need to send the output to a temporary
       file and then read it back in with the &#8220;.&#8221; command:

               $  resize &gt; /tmp/out
               $  . /tmp/out

       Resize determines the user&apos;s current shell by first checking if $SHELL is
       set, and using that.  Otherwise it determines the user&apos;s shell by looking
       in the password file.  Generally Bourne-shell variants (including ksh) do
       not  modify  $SHELL,  so  it is possible for resize to be confused if one
       runs resize from a Bourne shell spawned from a C shell.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with resize:

       -u      This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be gener&#8208;
               ated even if the user&apos;s current shell isn&apos;t /bin/sh.

       -c      This  option  indicates that C shell commands should be generated
               even if the user&apos;s current shell isn&apos;t /bin/csh.

       -s [rows columns]
               This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences  will  be
               used  instead of the VT100-style xterm escape codes.  If rows and
               columns are given, resize will ask the xterm  to  resize  itself.
               However, the window manager may choose to disallow the change.

       Note  that  the  Sun  console  escape sequences are recognized by XFree86
       xterm and by dtterm.  The resize program may  be  installed  as  sunsize,
       which causes makes it assume the -s option.

       The rows and columns arguments must appear last; though they are normally
       associated with the -s option, they are parsed separately.

FILES
       /etc/termcap   for the base termcap entry to modify.

       ~/.cshrc       user&apos;s alias for the command.
&#12;ENVIRONMENT
       TERM           set to &quot;xterm&quot; if not already set.

       TERMCAP        variable set on systems using termcap

       COLUMNS, LINES variables set on systems using terminfo
