REVPATH(1)                                                            REVPATH(1)



NAME
       revpath  -  generate  a  relative path that can be used to undo a change-
       directory

SYNOPSIS
       revpath path

DESCRIPTION
       The revpath program prints out a relative path that is the ``reverse&apos;&apos; or
       ``inverse&apos;&apos; of path.  Start with two directories top and bottom, with the
       latter below the former, and path is the location of bottom  relative  to
       top.   The  output  of revpath is the location of top relative to bottom.
       The resulting path contains a trailing `/&apos; character when the  result  is
       non-trivial.   If  path  is  equivalent  to  `.&apos;, the resulting output is
       empty.  If path is invalid in some way (e.g., doesn&apos;t represent the  path
       to  a  subdirectory)  the  output is also empty and no error messages are
       ever generated.

DIAGNOSTICS
       There are no diagnostics.  Error conditions are silently ignored, and the
       exit status is always 0.

BUGS
       It  isn&apos;t possible to reverse arbitrary relative paths.  If any path ele&#8208;
       ment between the two end points of path is a symbolic link,  the  results
       will probably be incorrect.
