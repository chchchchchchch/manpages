RFCOMM(1)                                                              RFCOMM(1)



NAME
       rfcomm - RFCOMM configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
       rfcomm [ options ] &lt; command &gt; &lt; dev &gt;

DESCRIPTION
       rfcomm  is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the RFCOMM configuration
       of the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. If no command  is  given,
       or  if the option -a is used, rfcomm prints information about the config&#8208;
       ured RFCOMM devices.

OPTIONS
       -h     Gives a list of possible commands.

       -a     Prints information about all configured RFCOMM devices.

       -r     Switch TTY into raw mode (doesn&apos;t work with &quot;bind&quot;).

       -f &lt;file&gt;
              Specify alternate config file.

       -i &lt;hciX&gt; | &lt;bdaddr&gt;
              The command is applied to device  -A  Enable  authentication.   -E
              Enable encryption.  -S Secure connection.  -M Become the master of
              a piconet.  hciX , which must be the name or  the  address  of  an
              installed  Bluetooth device. If not specified, the command will be
              use the first available Bluetooth device.

       -A     Enable authentification

       -E     Enable encryption

       -S     Secure connection

       -M     Become the master of a piconet

       -L &lt;seconds&gt;
              Set linger timeout

COMMANDS
       show &lt;dev&gt;
              Display the information about the specified device.

       connect &lt;dev&gt; [bdaddr] [channel]
              Connect the RFCOMM device to the remote Bluetooth  device  on  the
              specified  channel.  If  no  channel is specified, it will use the
              channel number 1. If also the Bluetooth address is  left  out,  it
              tries  to  read the data from the config file. This command can be
              terminated with the key sequence CTRL-C.

       listen &lt;dev&gt; [channel] [cmd]
              Listen on a specified RFCOMM channel for incoming connections.  If
              no  channel  is specified, it will use the channel number 1, but a
              channel must be specified before cmd. If cmd is given, it will  be
              executed as soon as a client connects. When the child process ter&#8208;
              minates or the client  disconnect,  the  command  will  terminate.
              Occurrences  of  {}  in  cmd  will  be replaced by the name of the
              device used by the connection. This command can be terminated with
              the key sequence CTRL-C.

       watch &lt;dev&gt; [channel] [cmd]
              Watch  is  identical  to listen except that when the child process
              terminates or the client disconnect, the command will restart lis&#8208;
              tening with the same parameters.

       bind &lt;dev&gt; [bdaddr] [channel]
              This  binds  the  RFCOMM  device to a remote Bluetooth device. The
              command did not establish a connection to the  remote  device,  it
              only creates the binding. The connection will be established right
              after an application tries to open the RFCOMM device. If no  chan&#8208;
              nel  number  is  specified,  it  uses the channel number 1. If the
              Bluetooth address is also left out, it tries to read the data from
              the config file.

              If  all  is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all devices that
              have bind yes set in the config will be bound.

       release &lt;dev&gt;
              This command releases a defined RFCOMM binding.

              If all is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all bindings  will
              be  removed.   This  command didn&apos;t care about the settings in the
              config file.
