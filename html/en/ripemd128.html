DESCRIPTION
       This package is an implementation in Tcl of the RIPEMD-128 message-digest
       algorithm  (1).  This  algorithm  takes an arbitrary quantity of data and
       generates a 128-bit message digest from the input. The  RIPEMD-128  algo&#8208;
       rithm  is  based upon the MD4 algorithm (2, 4) but has been cryptographi&#8208;
       cally strengthened against weaknesses that have been found  in  MD4  (4).
       RIPEMD-128  has been designed to be a drop-in replacement for MD4 and MD5
       (5). If security is the major  consideration,  then  RIPEMD-160  or  SHA1
       should be considered.

       This  package will use Trf to accelerate the digest computation if avail&#8208;
       able. In the absence of an accelerator package the  pure-Tcl  implementa&#8208;
       tion will be used.

COMMANDS
       ::ripemd::ripemd128 ?-hex? [ -channel channel | -file filename | string ]
              Calculate  the RIPEMD-128 digest of the data given in string. This
              is returned as a binary string by default. Giving the -hex  option
              will return a hexadecimal encoded version of the digest.

              The data to be hashed can be specified either as a string argument
              to the ripemd128 command, or as a filename or a  pre-opened  chan&#8208;
              nel.  If  the -filename argument is given then the file is opened,
              the data read and hashed and the file is closed. If  the  -channel
              argument is given then data is read from the channel until the end
              of file. The channel is not closed.

              Only one of -file, -channel or string should be given.

       ::ripemd::hmac128 ?-hex? -key key [ -channel channel | -file  filename  |
       string ]
              Calculate an Hashed Message Authentication digest (HMAC) using the
              RIPEMD-128 digest algorithm. HMACs are described in RFC  2104  (6)
              and  provide  a RIPEMD-128 digest that includes a key. All options
              other than -key are as for the ::ripemd::ripemd128 command.

PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
       For the programmer, hash functions can be viewed as a bucket  into  which
       one  pours  data.  When  you  have  finished, you extract a value that is
       uniquely derived from the data that was poured into the bucket. The  pro&#8208;
       gramming  interface  to  the  hash operates on a token (equivalent to the
       bucket).  You  call  RIPEMD128Init  to  obtain  a  token  and  then  call
       RIPEMD128Update  as  many  times  as required to add data to the hash. To
       release  any  resources  and  obtain  the  hash  value,  you  then   call
       RIPEMD128Final.  An  equivalent set of functions gives you a keyed digest
       (HMAC).

       If you have critcl and have built the tcllibc package then the  implemen&#8208;
       tation of the hashing function will be performed by compiled code. Alter&#8208;
       natively if both the Trf and Memchan extensions are available then  these
       will  be  used. Finally the package will revert to a pure-Tcl implementa&#8208;
       tion.  The programming interface remains the same, however.

       ::ripemd::RIPEMD128Init
              Begins a new RIPEMD-128 hash. Returns a token ID that must be used
              for the remaining functions.

       ::ripemd::RIPEMD128Update token data
              Add  data to the hash identified by token. Calling RIPEMD128Update
              $token &quot;abcd&quot; is equivalent to calling RIPEMD128Update $token &quot;ab&quot;
              followed by RIPEMD128Update $token &quot;cb&quot;. See EXAMPLES.

       ::ripemd::RIPEMD128Final token
              Returns  the  hash  value  and releases any resources held by this
              token. Once this command completes the token will be invalid.  The
              result  is  a  binary  string of 16 bytes representing the 128 bit
              RIPEMD-128 digest value.

       ::ripemd::RIPEHMAC128Init key
              This is equivalent to the ::ripemd::RIPEMD128Init  command  except
              that it requires the key that will be included in the HMAC.

       ::ripemd::RIPEHMAC128Update token data

       ::ripemd::RIPEHMAC128Final token
              These commands are identical to the RIPEMD128 equivalent commands.
