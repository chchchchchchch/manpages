NAME
       rl - Randomize Lines.

SYNOPSIS
       rl [OPTION]...  [FILE]...


DESCRIPTION
       rl  reads  lines  from  a  input  file or stdin, randomizes the lines and
       outputs a specified number of lines.  It does this  with  only  a  single
       pass over the input while trying to use as little memory as possible.


       -c, --count=N
              Select  the number of lines to be returned in the output.  If this
              argument is omitted all the lines in the file will be returned  in
              random order.  If the input contains less lines than specified and
              the --reselect option below is not specified a warning is  printed
              and all lines are returned in random order.


       -r, --reselect
              When  using  this  option  a  single line may be selected multiple
              times.  The default behaviour is that any input line will only  be
              selected once.  This option makes it possible to specify a --count
              option with more lines than the file actually holds.


       -o, --output=FILE
              Send randomized lines to FILE instead of stdout.


       -d, --delimiter=DELIM
              Use specified character as  a  &quot;line&quot;  delimiter  instead  of  the
              newline character.


       -0, --null
              Input  lines  are  terminated by a null character.  This option is
              useful to process the output of the GNU find -print0 option.


       -n, --line-number
              Output lines are numbered with the  line  number  from  the  input
              file.


       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Be quiet about any errors or warnings.


       -h, --help
              Show short summary of options.


       -v, --version
              Show version of program.


EXAMPLES
       Some simple demonstrations of how rl can help you do everyday tasks.
&#12;       Play a random sound after 4 minutes (perfect for toast):
           sleep 240 ; play `find /sounds -name &#180;*.au&#180; -print | rl --count=1`

       Play the 15 most recent .mp3 files in random order.
           ls -c *.mp3 | head -n 15 | rl  | xargs --delimiter=&#180;\n&#180; play

       Roll a dice:
           seq 6 | rl --count 2

       Roll a dice 1000 times and see which number comes up more often:
           seq 6 | rl --reselect --count 1000 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

       Shuffle the words of a sentence:
           echo -n &quot;The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.&quot; \
             | rl --delimiter=&#180; &#180;;echo

       Find all movies and play them in random order.
           find . -name &#180;*.avi&#180; -print0 | rl -0 | xargs -n 1 -0 mplayer
       Because -0 is used filenames with spaces (even newlines and other unusual
       characters) in them work.


BUGS
       The program currently does not have very smart memory management.  If you
       feed  it  huge  files  and expect it to fully randomize all lines it will
       completely read the file in memory. If you specify the --count option  it
       will  only  use  the  memory required for storing the specified number of
       lines.  Improvements on this area are on the TODO list.

       The program uses  the  rand()  system  random  function.   This  function
       returns  a  number between 0 and RAND_MAX, which may not be very large on
       some  systems.   This  will  result  in  non-random  results  for   files
       containing more lines than RAND_MAX.

       Note  that  if  you  specify multiple input files they are randomized per
       file.  This is a different result from when you cat  all  the  files  and
       pipe the result into rl.
