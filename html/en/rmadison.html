NAME
       rmadison -- Remotely query the Debian archive database about packages

SYNOPSIS
       rmadison [OPTIONS] PACKAGE ...

DESCRIPTION
       dak ls queries the Debian archive database (&quot;projectb&quot;) and displays
       which package version is registered per architecture/component/suite.
       The CGI at http://qa.debian.org/madison.php provides that service without
       requiring SSH access to ftp-master.debian.org or the mirror on
       ries.debian.org. This script, rmadison, is a command line frontend to
       this CGI.

OPTIONS
       -a, --architecture=ARCH
           only show info for ARCH(s)

       -b, --binary-type=TYPE
           only show info for binary TYPE

       -c, --component=COMPONENT
           only show info for COMPONENT(s)

       -g, --greaterorequal
           show buildd &apos;dep-wait pkg &gt;= {highest version}&apos; info

       -G, --greaterthan
           show buildd &apos;dep-wait pkg &gt;&gt; {highest version}&apos; info

       -h, --help
           show this help and exit

       -s, --suite=SUITE
           only show info for this suite

       -S, --source-and-binary
           show info for the binary children of source pkgs

       -t, --time
           show projectb snapshot and reload time (not supported by all
           archives)

       -u, --url=URL[,URL ...]
           use URL for the query. Supported shorthands are
            debian or qa http://qa.debian.org/madison.php
            bpo http://backports.debian.org/cgi-bin/madison.cgi
            debug http://debug.debian.net/cgi-bin/madison.cgi
            ubuntu http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/madison.cgi
            udd http://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/madison.cgi

           See the RMADISON_URL_MAP_ variable below for a method to add new
           shorthands.

       --version
           show version and exit

       --no-conf, --noconf
           don&apos;t read the devscripts configuration files

       ARCH, COMPONENT and SUITE can be comma (or space) separated lists, e.g.
       --architecture=m68k,i386

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
       sourced by a shell in that order to set configuration variables. Command
       line options can be used to override configuration file settings.
       Environment variable settings are ignored for this purpose. The currently
       recognised variables are:

       RMADISON_URL_MAP_SHORTHAND=URL
           Add an entry to the set of shorthand URLs listed above. SHORTHAND
           should be replaced with the shorthand form to be used to refer to
           URL.

           Multiple shorthand entries may be specified by using multiple
           RMADISON_URL_MAP_* variables.

       RMADISON_DEFAULT_URL=URL
           Set the default URL to use unless overridden by a command line
           option.

       RMADISON_ARCHITECTURE=ARCH
           Set the default architecture to use unless overridden by a command
           line option.  To run an unrestricted query when RMADISON_ARCHITECTURE
           is set, use --architecture=&apos;*&apos;.

NOTES
       dak ls also supports -r, --regex to treat PACKAGE as a regex. Since that
       can easily DoS the database (&quot;-r .&quot;), this option is not supported by the
       CGI and rmadison.

       dak ls was formerly called madison.

       The protocol used by rmadison is fairly simple, the CGI accepts query the
       parameters a, b, c, g, G, s, S, t, and package. The parameter text is
       passed to enable plain-text output.
