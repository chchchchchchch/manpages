PolyglotMan(1)                                                    PolyglotMan(1)



NAME
       PolyglotMan,  rman  -  reverse compile man pages from formatted form to a
       number of source formats: ASCII, roff, TkMan, Tk, Sections,  HTML,  SGML,
       MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, POD.

SYNOPSIS
       rman [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Up-to-date   instructions  can  be  found  at  http://polyglotman.source&#8208;
       forge.net/rman.html


       PolyglotMan  takes man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX and
       transforms  them into any of a number of text source formats. PolyglotMan
       was formerly known as RosettaMan. The name of the binary is still  called
       rman,  for  scripts  that  depend  on that name; mnemonically, just think
       &quot;reverse man&quot;. Previously PolyglotMan  required pages to be formatted  by
       nroff(1)  prior  to its processing. With version 3.0, it prefers [tn]roff
       source and usually produces results that are better yet. And source  pro&#8208;
       cessing is the only way to translate tables. Source format translation is
       not as mature as formatted, however, so try formatted  translation  as  a
       backup.

       In parsing [tn]roff source, one could implement an arbitrarily large sub&#8208;
       set of [tn]roff, which I did not and will not do, so the results  can  be
       off.  I  did  implement  a significant subset of those used in man pages,
       however, including tbl (but not eqn), if tests, and general macro defini&#8208;
       tions,  so usually the results look great. If they don&apos;t, format the page
       with nroff before sending it to PolyglotMan. If PolyglotMan doesn&apos;t  rec&#8208;
       ognize a key macro used by a large class of pages, however, e-mail me the
       source and a uuencoded nroff-formatted page and I&apos;ll see what I  can  do.
       When  running PolyglotMan with man page source that includes or redirects
       to other [tn]roff source using the .so (source or inclusion)  macro,  you
       should  be  in  the parent directory of the page, since pages are written
       with   this   assumption.   For   example,   if   you   are   translating
       /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1, first cd into /usr/share/man.

       PolyglotMan   accepts man pages from: SunOS, Sun Solaris, Hewlett-Packard
       HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka  Digital  UNIX,  DEC  Ultrix,  SGI  IRIX,
       Linux,  FreeBSD,  SCO.  Source  processing works for: SunOS, Sun Solaris,
       Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX, DEC Ultrix.
       It  can  produce printable ASCII-only (control characters stripped), sec&#8208;
       tion headers-only, Tk, TkMan, [tn]roff  (traditional  man  page  source),
       XML,  HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, Perl 5 POD. A modular architecture
       permits easy addition of additional output formats.

       The latest version of  PolyglotMan  is  available  from  http://polyglot&#8208;
       man.sourceforge.net/ .

OPTIONS
       The  following  options should not be used with any others and exit Poly&#8208;
       glotMan without processing any input.

       -h|--help      Show list of command line options and exit.

       -v|--version   Show version number and exit.

       You should specify the filter first, as this sets a number of parameters,
       and then specify other options.

       -f|--filter                                     &lt;ASCII|roff|TkMan|Tk|Sec&#8208;
       tions|HTML|XML|MIME|LaTeX|LaTeX2e|RTF|POD&gt;
                      Set the output filter. Defaults to ASCII.

       -S|--source    PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine  whether  its
                      input  is  source or formatted; use this option to declare
                      source input.

       -F|--format|--formatted
                      PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine  whether  its
                      input  is  source or formatted; use this option to declare
                      formatted input.

       -l|--title printf-string
                      In HTML mode this sets the &lt;TITLE&gt; of the man pages, given
                      the same parameters as -r .

       -r|--reference|--manref printf-string
                      In  HTML  and XML modes this sets the URL form by which to
                      retrieve other man pages. The string can use two  supplied
                      parameters:  the  man  page name and its section. (See the
                      Examples section.)  If the string is null (as if set  from
                      a  shell  by  &quot;-r &apos;&apos;&quot;), `-&apos; or `off&apos;, then man page refer&#8208;
                      ences will not be HREFs, just  set  in  italics.  If  your
                      printf  supports  XPG3  positions  specifier,  this can be
                      quite flexible.

       -V|--volumes &lt;colon-separated list&gt;
                      Set the list of valid volumes to check against when  look&#8208;
                      ing  for  cross-references to other man pages. Defaults to
                      1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:o:l:n:p (volume names can be  multichar&#8208;
                      acter). If an non-whitespace string in the page is immedi&#8208;
                      ately followed by a left  parenthesis,  then  one  of  the
                      valid volumes, and ends with optional other characters and
                      then a right parenthesis--then that string is reported  as
                      a  reference  to  another  manual  page. If this -V string
                      starts with an equals sign, then  no  optional  characters
                      are  allowed  between  the match to the list of valids and
                      the right parenthesis. (This  option  is  needed  for  SCO
                      UNIX.)

       The following options apply only when formatted pages are given as input.
       They do not apply to or are always handled correctly with the source.

       -b|--subsections
                      Try to recognize subsection titles in addition to  section
                      titles.  This can cause problems on some UNIX flavors.

       -K|--nobreak   Indicate  manual  pages  don&apos;t  have page breaks, so don&apos;t
                      look for footers and headers  around  them.  (Older  nroff
                      -man  macros  always  put  in page breaks, but lately some
                      vendors have realized  that  printouts  are  made  through
                      troff(1),  whereas  nroff -man is used to format pages for
                      reading on screen, and so have  eliminated  page  breaks.)
                      PolyglotMan   usually  gets  this  right even without this
                      flag.

       -k|--keep      Keep headers and footers, as a canonical report at the end
                      of  the  page.  changeleft  Move changebars, such as those
                      found in the Tcl/Tk manual pages, to the left. --&gt;  notag&#8208;
                      gressive  Disable  aggressive man page parsing. Aggressive
                      manual, which is on by default, page parsing elides  head&#8208;
                      ers and footers, identifies sections and more. --&gt;

       -n|--name name Set  name  of man page (used in roff format). If the file&#8208;
                      name is given in the form &quot; name . section &quot;, the name and
                      section are automatically determined. If the page is being
                      parsed from [tn]roff source and it has a  .TH  line,  this
                      information is extracted from that line.

       -p|--paragraph paragraph mode toggle. The filter determines whether lines
                      should be linebroken as they were  by  nroff,  or  whether
                      lines  should  be  flowed together into paragraphs. Mainly
                      for internal use.

       -s|section #   Set volume (aka section) number of man page (used in  roff
                      format).  tables Turn on aggressive table parsing. --&gt;

       -t|--tabstops #
                      For  those  macros  sets  that use tabs in place of spaces
                      where possible in order to reduce the number of characters
                      used, set tabstops every #  columns. Defaults to 8.

NOTES ON FILTER TYPES
   ROFF
       Some  flavors of UNIX ship man page without [tn]roff source, making one&apos;s
       laser printer little more than a laser-powered daisy wheel.  This  filter
       tries  to  intuit  the  original  [tn]roff  directives, which can then be
       recompiled by [tn]roff.

   TkMan
       TkMan(1), a hypertext man page browser,  uses  PolyglotMan  to  show  man
       pages  without the (usually) useless headers and footers on each page. It
       also collects section and (optionally) subsection heads for direct access
       from  a  pulldown menu. TkMan and Tcl/Tk, the toolkit in which it&apos;s writ&#8208;
       ten, are available via anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/

   Tk
       This option outputs the text in a series of Tcl lists consisting of text-
       tags  pairs, where tag names roughly correspond to HTML.  This output can
       be inserted into a Tk text widget by doing an  eval  &lt;textwidget&gt;  insert
       end  &lt;text&gt;  .  This format should be relatively easily parsible by other
       programs that want both the text and the tags. See also ASCII.

   ASCII
       When printed on a line printer, man pages try  to  produce  special  text
       effects  by overstriking characters with themselves (to produce bold) and
       underscores (underlining). Other text processing software, such  as  text
       editors,  searchers, and indexers, must counteract this. The ASCII filter
       strips away this formatting. Piping nroff output  through  col  -b   also
       strips  away this formatting, but it leaves behind unsightly page headers
       and footers. Also see Tk.

   Sections
       Dumps section and (optionally) subsection titles. This  might  be  useful
       for another program that processes man pages.

   HTML
       With  a  simple  extension  to a HTTP server for Mosaic(1) or other World
       Wide Web browser, PolyglotMan  can produce high quality HTML on the  fly.
       Several  such  extensions  and pointers to several others are included in
       PolyglotMan &apos;s contrib  directory.

   XML
       This is appoaching the Docbook DTD, but I&apos;m hoping that  someone  with  a
       real  interest  in this will polish the tags generated. Try it to see how
       close the tags are now.

   MIME
       MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) as defined by RFC 1563, good
       for  consumption  by  MIME-aware e-mailers or as Emacs (&gt;=19.29) enriched
       documents.

   LaTeX and LaTeX2e
       Why not?

   RTF
       Use output on Mac or NeXT or whatever. Maybe take random  man  pages  and
       integrate  them  better with NeXT&apos;s documentation system.  Maybe NeXT has
       its own man page macros that do this.
&#12;   PostScript and FrameMaker
       To produce PostScript, use groff  or psroff . To produce FrameMaker  MIF,
       use FrameMaker&apos;s builtin filter. In both cases you need [tn]roff  source,
       so if you only have a formatted version of the manual page, use Polyglot&#8208;
       Man &apos;s roff filter first.

EXAMPLES
       To  convert the formatted  man page named ls.1  back into [tn]roff source
       form:

       rman -f roff /usr/local/man/cat1/ls.1 &gt; /usr/local/man/man1/ls.1

       Long man pages are often compressed to  conserve  space  (compression  is
       especially effective on formatted man pages as many of the characters are
       spaces). As it is a long man page, it probably has subsections, which  we
       try  to  separate out (some macro sets don&apos;t distinguish subsections well
       enough for PolyglotMan to detect them). Let&apos;s convert this to LaTeX  for&#8208;
       mat:

       pcat  /usr/catman/a_man/cat1/automount.z  |  rman -b -n automount -s 1 -f
       latex &gt; automount.man

       Alternatively, man 1 automount | rman -b -n automount -s  1  -f  latex  &gt;
       automount.man

       For  HTML/Mosaic  users,  PolyglotMan   can,  without modification of the
       source code, produce HTML links that point to other HTML man pages either
       pregenerated  or  generated  on  the fly. First let&apos;s assume pregenerated
       HTML versions of man pages  stored  in  /usr/share/man/html  .   Generate
       these one-by-one with the following form:
       rman      -f      html      -r      &apos;http:/usr/share/man/html/%s.%s.html&apos;
       /usr/share/man/cat1/ls.1 &gt; /usr/share/man/html/ls.1.html

       If you&apos;ve extended your HTML client to  generate  HTML  on  the  fly  you
       should use something like:
       rman -f html -r &apos;http:~/bin/man2html?%s:%s&apos; /usr/share/man/cat1/ls.1
       when generating HTML.

BUGS/INCOMPATIBILITIES
       PolyglotMan  is not perfect in all cases, but it usually does a good job,
       and in any case reduces the problem of  converting  man  pages  to  light
       editing.

       Tables in formatted pages, especially H-P&apos;s, aren&apos;t handled very well. Be
       sure to pass in source for the page to recognize tables.

       The man pager woman(1) applies its own idea of formatting for man  pages,
       which  can  confuse  PolyglotMan . Bypass woman  by passing the formatted
       manual page text directly into PolyglotMan .

       The [tn]roff output format uses fB to turn on boldface. If your macro set
       requires .B, you&apos;ll have to a postprocess the PolyglotMan output.
