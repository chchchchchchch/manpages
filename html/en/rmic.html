Name
       rmic - The Java RMI Compiler

       rmic  generates  stub, skeleton, and tie classes for remote objects using
       either the JRMP or IIOP protocols. Also generates OMG IDL.

SYNOPSIS
       rmic [ options ] package-qualified-class-name(s)


DESCRIPTION
       The rmic compiler generates stub and skeleton class files (JRMP protocol)
       and  stub  and  tie class files (IIOP protocol) for remote objects. These
       classes files are  generated  from  compiled  Java  programming  language
       classes that are remote object implementation classes. A remote implemen&#8208;
       tation class is a class that implements  the  interface  java.rmi.Remote.
       The  class  names  in the rmic command must be for classes that have been
       compiled successfully with the javac command and must  be  fully  package
       qualified.  For example, running rmic on the class file name HelloImpl as
       shown here:

       rmic hello.HelloImpl


       creates the HelloImpl_Stub.class file in the  hello  subdirectory  (named
       for the class&apos;s package).

       A skeleton for a remote object is a JRMP protocol server-side entity that
       has a method that dispatches calls to the actual remote object  implemen&#8208;
       tation.

       A  tie for a remote object is a server-side entity similar to a skeleton,
       but which communicates with the client using the IIOP protocol.

       A stub is a client-side proxy for a remote object  which  is  responsible
       for  communicating  method  invocations  on  remote objects to the server
       where the actual remote object implementation resides. A client&apos;s  refer&#8208;
       ence  to  a  remote object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local
       stub.

       By default, rmic generates stub classes that use the 1.2 JRMP stub proto&#8208;
       col  version  only, as if the -v1.2 option had been specified. (Note that
       the -vcompat option was the default in releases prior to  5.0.)  Use  the
       -iiop option to generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol.

       A  stub  implements  only the remote interfaces, not any local interfaces
       that the remote object also implements. Because a  JRMP  stub  implements
       the  same  set of remote interfaces as the remote object itself, a client
       can use the Java programming language&apos;s built-in  operators  for  casting
       and  type checking. For IIOP, the PortableRemoteObject.narrow method must
       be used.

OPTIONS
          -bootclasspath path
             Overrides location of bootstrap class files

          -classpath path
             Specifies the path rmic uses to look up classes. This option  over&#8208;
             rides  the  default  or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is
             set. Directories are separated by colons. Thus the  general  format
             for path is:
             For example:

          -d directory
             Specifies  the  root  destination directory for the generated class
             hierarchy. You can use this option to specify a destination  direc&#8208;
             tory  for  the stub, skeleton, and tie files. For example, the com&#8208;
             mand
             % rmic -d /java/classes foo.MyClass
             would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from MyClass into
             the directory /java/classes/foo. If the -d option is not specified,
             the default behavior is as if &quot;-d .&quot; were  specified:  the  package
             hierarchy  of the target class is created in the current directory,
             and stub/tie/skeleton files are placed within  it.  (Note  that  in
             some  previous  versions of rmic, if -d was not specified, then the
             package hierarchy was not created, and all of the output files were
             placed directly in the current directory.)


          -extdirs path
             Overrides location of installed extensions

          -g Enables  generation  of  all debugging information, including local
             variables. By default, only line number information is generated.

          -idl
             Causes rmic to generate OMG IDL for the classes specified  and  any
             classes  referenced. IDL provides a purely declarative, programming
             language-independent way of specifying an object&apos;s API. The IDL  is
             used as a specification for methods and data that can be written in
             and invoked from any language that provides  CORBA  bindings.  This
             includes Java and C++ among others. See the Java Language to IDL
             Mapping @
             http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/java_language_map&#8208;
             ping_to_omg_idl.htm (OMG) document for a complete description.
             When the -idl option is used, other options also include:

             -always or -alwaysgenerate
                Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer
                than the input class.

             -factory
                Uses factory keyword in generated IDL.

             -idlModule  fromJavaPackage[.class]  toIDLModule
                Specifies IDLEntity package mapping. For example:  -idlModule
                foo.bar my::real::idlmod.

             -idlFile  fromJavaPackage[.class]  toIDLFile
                Specifies IDLEntity file mapping. For example:  -idlFile
                test.pkg.X TEST16.idl.

          -iiop
             Causes rmic to generate IIOP stub and tie classes, rather than JRMP
             stub and skeleton classes. A stub class is a local proxy for a
             remote object and is used by clients to send calls to a server.
             Each remote interface requires a stub class, which implements that
             remote interface. A client&apos;s reference to a remote object is actu&#8208;
             ally a reference to a stub. Tie classes are used on the server side
             to process incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the proper
             implementation class. Each implementation class requires a tie
             class.
             Invoking rmic with the -iiop generates stubs and ties that conform
             to this naming convention:
             _&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
             _&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class
             When the -iiop option is used, other options also include:
&#12;             -always or -alwaysgenerate
                Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer
                than the input class.

             -nolocalstubs
                Do not create stubs optimized for same-process clients and
                servers.

             -noValueMethods
                Must be used with the -idl option. Prevents addition of value&#8208;
                type methods and initializers to emitted IDL. These methods and
                initializers are optional for valuetypes, and are generated
                unless the -noValueMethods option is specified when using the
                -idl option.

             -poa
                Changes the inheritance from org.omg.CORBA_2_3.porta&#8208;
                ble.ObjectImpl to org.omg.PortableServer.Servant. The Portable&#8208;
                Server module for the Portable Object Adapter @
                http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech&#8208;
                notes/guides/idl/POA.html (POA) defines the native Servant type.
                In the Java programming language, the Servant type is mapped to
                the Java org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It serves as the
                base class for all POA servant implementations and provides a
                number of methods that may be invoked by the application pro&#8208;
                grammer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA itself
                and may be overridden by the user to control aspects of servant
                behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to Java Language Mapping Specifi&#8208;
                cation, CORBA V 2.3.1 ptc/00-01-08.pdf.

          -J Used in conjunction with any java option, it passes the option fol&#8208;
             lowing the -J (no spaces between the -J and the option) on to the
             java interpreter.

          -keep or -keepgenerated
             Retains the generated .java source files for the stub, skeleton,
             and/or tie classes and writes them to the same directory as the
             .class files.

          -nowarn
             Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any
             warnings.

          -nowrite
             Does not write compiled classes to the file system.

          -vcompat
             Generates stub and skeleton classes compatible with both the 1.1
             and 1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions. (This option was the default
             in releases prior to 5.0.) The generated stub classes will use the
             1.1 stub protocol version when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine
             and will use the 1.2 stub protocol version when loaded into a 1.2
             (or later) virtual machine. The generated skeleton classes will
             support both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol versions. The generated
             classes are relatively large in order to support both modes of
             operation.

          -verbose
             Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what
             classes are being compiled and what class files are being loaded.

          -v1.1
             Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub protocol
             version only. Note that this option is only useful for generating
             stub classes that are serialization-compatible with pre-existing,
             statically-deployed stub classes that were generated by the rmic
             tool from JDK 1.1 and that cannot be upgraded (and dynamic class
             loading is not being used).

          -v1.2
             (default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol
             version only. No skeleton classes are generated with this option
             because skeleton classes are not used with the 1.2 stub protocol
             version. The generated stub classes will not work if they are
             loaded into a JDK 1.1 virtual machine.
