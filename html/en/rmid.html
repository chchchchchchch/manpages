Name
       rmid - The Java RMI Activation System Daemon

       rmid starts the activation system daemon that allows objects to be regis&#8208;
       tered and activated in a virtual machine (VM).

SYNOPSIS
       rmid [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The rmid tool starts the activation system daemon. The activation  system
       daemon  must  be  started before activatable objects can be either regis&#8208;
       tered with the activation system or activated in a VM. See the Java RMI
       Specification @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html and
       Activation tutorials @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/activa&#8208;
       tion/overview.html for details on how to write programs that use activat&#8208;
       able remote objects.

       The daemon can be started by executing the rmid command, and specifying a
       security policy file, as follows:

           rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy


       Note: When running Sun&apos;s implementation of rmid, by default you will need
       to specify a security policy file so that rmid can verify whether or not
       the information in each ActivationGroupDesc is allowed to be used to
       launch a VM for an activation group. Specifically, the command and
       options specified by the CommandEnvironment and any Properties passed to
       an ActivationGroupDesc&apos;s constructor must now be explicitly allowed in
       the security policy file for rmid. The value of the sun.rmi.activa&#8208;
       tion.execPolicy property dictates the policy that rmid uses to determine
       whether or not the information in an ActivationGroupDesc may be used to
       launch a VM for an activation group.

       Executing rmid by default

          o starts the Activator and an internal registry on the default port,
            1098, and

          o binds an ActivationSystem to the name java.rmi.activation.Activa&#8208;
            tionSystem in this internal registry.


       To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must specify the -port
       option when starting up rmid. For example,

           rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099


       starts the activation system daemon and a registry on the registry&apos;s
       default port, 1099.

   Starting rmid from inetd/xinetd
       An alternative to starting rmid from the command line is to configure
       inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) to start rmid on demand.

       When rmid starts up, it attempts to obtain an inherited channel (inher&#8208;
       ited from inetd/xinetd) by invoking the System.inheritedChannel method.
       If the inherited channel is null or not an instance of java.nio.chan&#8208;
       nels.ServerSocketChannel, then rmid assumes that it was not started by
       inetd/xinetd, and it starts up as described above.

       If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel instance, then rmid
       uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained from the ServerSocketChannel as
       the server socket that accepts requests for the remote objects it
       exports, namely the registry in which the java.rmi.activation.Activation&#8208;
       System is bound and the java.rmi.activation.Activator remote object. In
       this mode, rmid behaves the same as when it is started from the command
       line, except:

          o Output printed to System.err is redirected to a file. This file is
            located in the directory specified by the java.io.tmpdir system
            property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp) with the prefix &quot;rmid-err&quot; and
            the suffix &quot;tmp&quot;.

          o The -port option is disallowed. If this option is specified, rmid
            will exit with an error message.

          o The -log option is required. If this option is not specified, rmid
            will exit with an error message.


       See the man pages for inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) for details on
       how to configure services to be started on demand.

OPTIONS
          -C&lt;someCommandLineOption&gt;
             Specifies an option that is passed as a command-line argument to
             each child process (activation group) of rmid when that process is
             created. For example, you could pass a property to each virtual
             machine spawned by the activation system daemon:
                 rmid -C-Dsome.property=value
             This ability to pass command-line arguments to child processes can
             be useful for debugging. For example, the following command:
                 rmid -C-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true
             will enable server-call logging in all child VMs.

          -J&lt;someCommandLineOption&gt;
             Specifies an option that is passed to the java interpreter running
             rmid. For example, to specify that rmid use a policy file named
             rmid.policy, the -J option can be used to define the java.secu&#8208;
             rity.policy property on rmid&apos;s command line, for example:
                 rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

          -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=&lt;policy&gt;
             Specifies the policy that rmid employs to check commands and com&#8208;
             mand-line options used to launch the VM in which an activation
             group runs. Please note that this option exists only in Sun&apos;s
             implementation of the Java RMI activation daemon. If this property
             is not specified on the command line, the result is the same as if
             -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default were specified. The pos&#8208;
             sible values of &lt;policy&gt; can be default, &lt;policyClassName&gt;, or
             none:

             o default (or if this property is unspecified)

             The default execPolicy allows rmid to execute commands with spe&#8208;
             cific command-line options only if rmid has been granted permission
             to execute those commands and options in the security policy file
             that rmid uses. Only the default activation group implementation
             can be used with the default execution policy.

             rmid launches a VM for an activation group using the information in
             the group&apos;s registered activation group descriptor, an Activation&#8208;
             GroupDesc. The group descriptor specifies an optional Activation&#8208;
             GroupDesc.CommandEnvironment which includes the command to execute
             to start the activation group as well as any command line options
             to be added to the command line. By default, rmid uses the java
             command found in java.home. The group descriptor also contains
             properties overrides that are added to the command line as options
             defined as:
                 -D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

             The permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission is used to grant
             rmid permission to execute a command, specified in the group
             descriptor&apos;s CommandEnvironment to launch an activation group. The
             permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission is used to allow
             rmid to use command-line options, specified as properties overrides
             in the group descriptor or as options in the CommandEnvironment,
             when launching the activation group.

             When granting rmid permission to execute various commands and
             options, the permissions ExecPermission and ExecOptionPermission
             need to be granted universally (i.e., granted to all code sources).

                ExecPermission
                   The ExecPermission class represents permission for rmid to
                   execute a specific command to launch an activation group.

                Syntax
                The name of an ExecPermission is the path name of a command to
                grant rmid permission to execute. A path name that ends in &quot;/*&quot;
                indicates all the files contained in that directory (where &quot;/&quot;
                is the file-separator character, File.separatorChar). A path
                name that ends with &quot;/-&quot; indicates all files and subdirectories
                contained in that directory (recursively). A path name consist&#8208;
                ing of the special token &quot;&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;&quot; matches any file.

                Note: A path name consisting of a single &quot;*&quot; indicates all the
                files in the current directory, while a path name consisting of
                a single &quot;-&quot; indicates all the files in the current directory
                and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the
                current directory.

                ExecOptionPermission
                   The ExecOptionPermission class represents permission for rmid
                   to use a specific command-line option when launching an acti&#8208;
                   vation group. The name of an ExecOptionPermission is the
                   value of a command line option.

                Syntax
                Options support a limited wildcard scheme. An asterisk signifies
                a wildcard match, and it may appear as the option name itself
                (i.e., it matches any option), or an asterisk may appear at the
                end of the option name only if the asterisk follows either a &quot;.&quot;
                or &quot;=&quot;.

                For example: &quot;*&quot; or &quot;-Dfoo.*&quot; or &quot;-Da.b.c=*&quot; is valid, &quot;*foo&quot; or
                &quot;-Da*b&quot; or &quot;ab*&quot; is not.

                Policy file for rmid
                   When granting rmid permission to execute various commands and
                   options, the permissions ExecPermission and ExecOptionPermis&#8208;
                   sion need to be granted universally (i.e., granted to all
                   code sources). It is safe to grant these permissions univer&#8208;
                   sally because only rmid checks these permissions.

                An example policy file that grants various execute permissions
                to rmid is:
                grant {
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        &quot;/files/apps/java/jdk1.7.0/solaris/bin/java&quot;;

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        &quot;/files/apps/rmidcmds/*&quot;;

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        &quot;-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy&quot;;

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        &quot;-Djava.security.debug=*&quot;;

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        &quot;-Dsun.rmi.*&quot;;
                };
                The first permission granted allow rmid to execute the 1.7.0
                version of the java command, specified by its explicit path
                name. Note that by default, the version of the java command
                found in java.home is used (the same one that rmid uses), and
                does not need to be specified in the policy file. The second
                permission allows rmid to execute any command in the directory
                /files/apps/rmidcmds.

                The third permission granted, an ExecOptionPermission, allows
                rmid to launch an activation group that defines the security
                policy file to be /files/policies/group.policy. The next permis&#8208;
                sion allows the java.security.debug property to be used by an
                activation group. The last permission allows any property in the
                sun.rmi property name hierarchy to be used by activation groups.

                To start rmid with a policy file, the java.security.policy prop&#8208;
                erty needs to be specified on rmid&apos;s command line, for example:

                rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

             o &lt;policyClassName&gt;

             If the default behavior is not flexible enough, an administrator
             can provide, when starting rmid, the name of a class whose checkEx&#8208;
             ecCommand method is executed in order to check commands to be exe&#8208;
             cuted by rmid.

             The policyClassName specifies a public class with a public,
             no-argument constructor and an implementation of the following
             checkExecCommand method:
                 public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc,
                                              String[] command)
                     throws SecurityException;
             Before launching an activation group, rmid calls the policy&apos;s
             checkExecCommand method, passing it the activation group descriptor
             and an array containing the complete command to launch the activa&#8208;
             tion group. If the checkExecCommand throws a SecurityException,
             rmid will not launch the activation group and an ActivationExcep&#8208;
             tion will be thrown to the caller attempting to activate the
             object.

             o none

             If the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property value is &quot;none&quot;, then
             rmid will not perform any validation of commands to launch activa&#8208;
             tion groups.

          -log dir
             Specifies the name of the directory the activation system daemon
             uses to write its database and associated information. The log
             directory defaults to creating a directory, log, in the directory
             in which the rmid command was executed.

          -port port
             Specifies the port rmid&apos;s registry uses. The activation system dae&#8208;
             mon binds the ActivationSystem, with the name java.rmi.activa&#8208;
             tion.ActivationSystem, in this registry. Thus, the ActivationSystem
             on the local machine can be obtained using the following Nam&#8208;
             ing.lookup method call:
                 import java.rmi.*;
                 import java.rmi.activation.*;

                 ActivationSystem system; system = (ActivationSystem)
                 Naming.lookup(&quot;//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem&quot;);

          -stop
             Stops the current invocation of rmid, for a port specified by the
             -port option. If no port is specified, it will stop the rmid run&#8208;
             ning on port 1098.
