Name
       rmiregistry - The Java Remote Object Registry

          The  rmiregistry command starts a remote object registry on the speci&#8208;
          fied port on the current host.


SYNOPSIS
       rmiregistry [port]


DESCRIPTION
       The rmiregistry command creates and starts a remote  object  registry  on
       the  specified port on the current host. If port is omitted, the registry
       is started on port 1099. The rmiregistry command produces no  output  and
       is typically run in the background. For example:

       rmiregistry &amp;

       A  remote  object  registry is a bootstrap naming service that is used by
       RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to names. Clients  on
       local  and  remote  hosts can then look up remote objects and make remote
       method invocations.

       The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object on which
       an  application needs to invoke methods. That object in turn will provide
       application-specific support for finding other objects.

       The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class are used to get
       a registry operating on the local host or local host and port.

       The  URL-based methods of the java.rmi.Naming class operate on a registry
       and can be used to look up a remote object on any host, and on the  local
       host:  bind  a simple (string) name to a remote object, rebind a new name
       to a remote object (overriding the old binding), unbind a remote  object,
       and list the URLs bound in the registry.

OPTIONS
          -J Used in conjunction with any java option, it passes the option fol&#8208;
             lowing the -J (no spaces between the -J and the option) on  to  the
             java interpreter.
