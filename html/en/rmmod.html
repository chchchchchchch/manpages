RMMOD(8)                              rmmod                             RMMOD(8)



NAME
       rmmod - Simple program to remove a module from the Linux Kernel

SYNOPSIS
       rmmod [-f] [-w] [-s] [-v] [modulename]

DESCRIPTION
       rmmod is a trivial program to remove a module (when module unloading
       support is provided) from the kernel. Most users will want to use
       modprobe(8) with the -r option instead.

OPTIONS
       -v --verbose
           Print messages about what the program is doing. Usually rmmod prints
           messages only if something goes wrong.

       -f --force
           This option can be extremely dangerous: it has no effect unless
           CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD was set when the kernel was compiled. With
           this option, you can remove modules which are being used, or which
           are not designed to be removed, or have been marked as unsafe (see
           lsmod(8)).

       -w --wait
           Normally, rmmod will refuse to unload modules which are in use. With
           this option, rmmod will isolate the module, and wait until the module
           is no longer used. Nothing new will be able to use the module, but
           it&apos;s up to you to make sure the current users eventually finish with
           it. See lsmod(8)) for information on usage counts.

       -s --syslog
           Send errors to syslog instead of standard error.

       -V --version
           Show version of program and exit.
