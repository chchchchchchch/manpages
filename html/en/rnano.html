RNANO(1)                                                                RNANO(1)



NAME
       rnano  - Restricted mode for Nano&apos;s ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico
       clone


SYNOPSIS
       rnano [OPTIONS] [[+LINE,COLUMN] FILE]...


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the rnano command.

       nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico, the
       default  editor  included  in the non-free Pine package. Rather than just
       copying Pico&apos;s look and feel, nano also implements some missing (or  dis&#8208;
       abled  by default) features in Pico, such as &quot;search and replace&quot; and &quot;go
       to line and column number&quot;.

       rnano is a restricted version of nano, which only  edits  specific  files
       and doesn&apos;t allow the user access to the filesystem or a command shell.

       In restricted mode, nano will not:

       &#183; read or write to any file not specified on the command line;

       &#183; read any nanorc files;

       &#183; allow suspending;

       &#183; allow  a file to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a differ&#8208;
         ent name;

       &#183; use backup files or spell checking.


OPTIONS
       +LINE,COLUMN
              Places cursor at line number LINE and  column  number  COLUMN  (at
              least  one  of which must be specified) on startup, instead of the
              default of line 1, column 1.

       -?     Same as -h (--help).

       -h (--help)
              Show a summary of command line options and exit.

       -V (--version)
              Show the current version number and exit.

       See the nano(1) manpage for the complete documentation of nano.
