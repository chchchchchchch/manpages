ROFF(7)                                                                  ROFF(7)



NAME
       roff - concepts and history of roff typesetting

DESCRIPTION
       roff  is  the  general  name for a set of text formatting programs, known
       under names like troff, nroff, ditroff, groff, etc.  A roff  system  con&#8208;
       sists of an extensible text formatting language and a set of programs for
       printing and converting to other text formats.  Unix-like operating  sys&#8208;
       tems distribute a roff system as a core package.

       The most common roff system today is the free software implementation GNU
       roff, groff(1).  groff implements the look-and-feel and functionality  of
       its ancestors, with many extensions.

       The  ancestry of roff is described in section HISTORY.  In this document,
       the term roff always refers to the general class of roff programs, not to
       the roff command provided in early UNIX systems.

       In  spite  of its age, roff is in wide use today, for example, the manual
       pages on UNIX systems (man pages), many software books, system documenta&#8208;
       tion,  standards,  and corporate documents are written in roff.  The roff
       output for text devices is still unmatched, and its graphical output  has
       the  same  quality as other free type-setting programs and is better than
       some of the commercial systems.

       roff is used to format UNIX manual pages, (or man  pages),  the  standard
       documentation system on many UNIX-derived operating systems.

       This  document  describes the history of the development of the roff sys&#8208;
       tem; some usage aspects common to all roff versions, details on the  roff
       pipeline, which is usually hidden behind front-ends like groff(1); a gen&#8208;
       eral overview of the formatting language;  some  tips  for  editing  roff
       files; and many pointers to further readings.

HISTORY
       Document formatting by computer dates back to the 1960s.  The roff system
       itself is intimately connected to the  Unix  operating  system,  but  its
       roots go back to the earlier operating systems CTSS and Multics.

   The Predecessor RUNOFF
       roff&apos;s  ancestor  RUNOFF was written in the MAD language by Jerry Saltzer
       for the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS), a project of the Massachu&#8208;
       setts  Institute  of  Technology (MIT), in 1963 and 1964 &#8211; note that CTSS
       commands were all uppercase.

       In 1965, MIT&apos;s Project MAC teamed with Bell Telephone Laboratories  (BTL)
       and   General   Electric   to   begin   the   Multics   system   &#10216;http://
       www.multicians.org&#10217;.  A command called runoff was written for Multics  in
       the late 60s in the BCPL language, by Bob Morris, Doug McIlroy, and other
       members of the Multics team.

       Like its CTSS ancestor, Multics runoff formatted an input file consisting
       of text and command lines; commands began with a period and were two let&#8208;
       ters.  Output from these commands was to terminal  devices  such  as  IBM
       Selectric  terminals.  Multics runoff had additional features added, such
       as the ability to do two-pass formatting; it became the main  format  for
       Multics documentation and text processing.

       BCPL and runoff were ported to the GCOS system at Bell Labs when BTL left
       the development of Multics.

   The Classical nroff/troff System
       At BTL, there was a need to drive the Graphic Systems CAT  typesetter,  a
       graphical  output  device from a PDP-11 computer running Unix.  As runoff
       was too limited for this task it was further developed into a more power&#8208;
       ful  text  formatting system by Joseph F. Ossanna, who already programmed
       several runoff ports.

       The name runoff was shortened to roff.  The greatly enlarged language  of
       Ossanna&apos;s  version  already  included all elements of a full roff system.
       All modern roff systems try to implement compatibility  to  this  system.
       So Joe Ossanna can be called the father of all roff systems.

       This first roff system had three formatter programs.

       troff  (typesetter  roff)  generated a graphical output for the CAT type&#8208;
              setter as its only device.

       nroff  produced text output suitable for terminals and line printers.

       roff   was the reimplementation of the former  runoff  program  with  its
              limited  features;  this  program was abandoned in later versions.
              Today, the name roff is used to refer to a troff/nroff sytem as  a
              whole.

       Ossanna&apos;s  first  version was written in the PDP-11 assembly language and
       released in 1973.  Brian Kernighan joined the roff development by rewrit&#8208;
       ing  it  in  the  C  programming language.  The C version was released in
       1975.

       The syntax of the formatting language of  the  nroff/troff  programs  was
       documented  in the famous Troff User&apos;s Manual [CSTR #54], first published
       in 1976, with further revisions up to 1992 by Brian Kernighan.  This doc&#8208;
       ument  is  the specification of the classical troff.  All later roff sys&#8208;
       tems tried to establish compatibility with this specification.

       After Ossanna&apos;s death in 1977, Kernighan went on with  developing  troff.
       In  the  late 1970s, Kernighan equipped troff with a general interface to
       support more devices, the intermediate output format, and the postproces&#8208;
       sor system.  This completed the structure of a roff system as it is still
       in use today; see section USING ROFF.   In  1979,  these  novelties  were
       described  in  the paper [CSTR #97].  This new troff version is the basis
       for all existing newer troff systems, including groff.  On some  systems,
       this device independent troff got a binary of its own, called ditroff(7).
       All modern troff programs already provide the full  ditroff  capabilities
       automatically.

   Availability
       The  source  code  of  both  the ancient Unix and classical troff weren&apos;t
       available for two decades.  Meanwhile, it is accessible  again  (on-line)
       for non-commercial use, cf. section SEE ALSO.

   Free roff
       The most important free roff project was the GNU implementation of troff,
       written from scratch by James Clark and put under the GNU Public  License
       &#10216;http://www.gnu.org/copyleft&#10217;.   It  was  called  groff  (GNU roff).  See
       groff(1) for an overview.

       The groff system is still actively developed.  It is  compatible  to  the
       classical  troff,  but  many extensions were added.  It is the first roff
       system that is available on almost all operating  systems  &#8211;  and  it  is
       free.  This makes groff the de-facto roff standard today.

       An  alternative  is Gunnar Ritter&apos;s Heirloom Documentation Tools &#10216;http://
       heirloom.sf.net&#10217; project, started in 2005, which provides  enhanced  ver&#8208;
       sions of the various roff tools found in the OpenSolaris and Plan 9 oper&#8208;
       ating systems, now available under free licenses.

USING ROFF
       Most people won&apos;t even notice that they are actually  using  roff.   When
       you  read  a  system  manual page (man page) roff is working in the back&#8208;
       ground.  roff documents  can  be  viewed  with  a  native  viewer  called
       xditview(1x), a standard program of the X window distribution, see X(7x).
       But using roff explicitly isn&apos;t difficult either.

       Some roff implementations provide wrapper programs that make it  easy  to
       use the roff system on the shell command line.  For example, the GNU roff
       implementation groff(1) provides command line options to avoid  the  long
       command  pipes  of classical troff; a program grog(1) tries to guess from
       the document which arguments should be used for a run  of  groff;  people
       who do not like specifying command line options should try the groffer(1)
       program for graphically displaying groff files and man pages.

   The roff Pipe
       Each roff system consists of preprocessors, roff formatter programs,  and
       a set of device postprocessors.  This concept makes heavy use of the pip&#8208;
       ing mechanism, that is, a series of programs  is  called  one  after  the
       other,  where  the  output  of  each program in the queue is taken as the
       input for the next program.

              cat file | ... | preproc | ... | troff options | postproc

       The preprocessors generate roff code that is fed into  a  roff  formatter
       (e.g.  troff),  which  in  turn generates intermediate output that is fed
       into a device postprocessor program for printing or final output.

       All of these parts use programming languages of their own; each  language
       is  totally  unrelated to the other parts.  Moreover, roff macro packages
       that were tailored for special purposes can be included.

       Most roff documents use the macros of some package, intermixed with  code
       for  one  or more preprocessors, spiced with some elements from the plain
       roff language.  The full power of the roff formatting language is  seldom
       needed  by  users;  only programmers of macro packages need to know about
       the gory details.

   Preprocessors
       A roff preprocessor is any program that generates output  that  syntacti&#8208;
       cally obeys the rules of the roff formatting language.  Each preprocessor
       defines a language of its own that is translated into roff code when  run
       through  the  preprocessor program.  Parts written in these languages may
       be included within a roff document; they are identified by  special  roff
       requests  or macros.  Each document that is enhanced by preprocessor code
       must be run through all corresponding preprocessors before it is fed into
       the  actual  roff  formatter  program, for the formatter just ignores all
       alien code.  The preprocessor programs extract  and  transform  only  the
       document parts that are determined for them.

       There  are a lot of free and commercial roff preprocessors.  Some of them
       aren&apos;t available on each system, but there is a small set  of  preproces&#8208;
       sors  that  are  considered as an integral part of each roff system.  The
       classical preprocessors are

              tab (@); lb l.  tbl@for  tables.   eqn@for  mathematical  formul&#230;.
              pic@for  drawing  diagrams.   refer@for  bibliographic references.
              soelim@for  including  macro  files   from   standard   locations.
              chem@for drawing chemical formul&#230;.

       Other known preprocessors that are not available on all systems include

              tab (@); lb l.  grap@for constructing graphical elements.  grn@for
              including gremlin(1) pictures.

   Formatter Programs
       A roff formatter is a program that parses documents written in  the  roff
       formatting  language  or uses some of the roff macro packages.  It gener&#8208;
       ates intermediate output, which is intended  to  be  fed  into  a  single
       device  postprocessor  that must be specified by a command-line option to
       the formatter program.  The documents must have been run through all nec&#8208;
       essary preprocessors before.

       The  output  produced  by  a roff formatter is represented in yet another
       language, the intermediate output format or troff output.  This  language
       was  first  specified  in  [CSTR #97]; its GNU extension is documented in
       groff_out(5).  The intermediate output language is  a  kind  of  assembly
       language  compared to the high-level roff language.  The generated inter&#8208;
       mediate output is optimized for a special device, but the language is the
       same for every device.

       The roff formatter is the heart of the roff system.  The traditional roff
       had two formatters, nroff  for  text  devices  and  troff  for  graphical
       devices.

       Often,  the name troff is used as a general term to refer to both format&#8208;
       ters.

   Devices and Postprocessors
       Devices are hardware interfaces like printers, text or  graphical  termi&#8208;
       nals,  etc., or software interfaces such as a conversion into a different
       text or graphical format.

       A roff postprocessor is a program that transforms  troff  output  into  a
       form  suitable  for  a  special device.  The roff postprocessors are like
       device drivers for the output target.

       For each device there is a postprocessor program  that  fits  the  device
       optimally.   The  postprocessor  parses the generated intermediate output
       and generates device-specific code that is sent directly to the device.

       The names of the devices and the postprocessor  programs  are  not  fixed
       because they greatly depend on the software and hardware abilities of the
       actual  computer.   For  example,  the  classical  devices  mentioned  in
       [CSTR #54] have greatly changed since the classical times.  The old hard&#8208;
       ware doesn&apos;t exist any longer and  the  old  graphical  conversions  were
       quite imprecise when compared to their modern counterparts.

       For  example, the Postscript device post in classical troff had a resolu&#8208;
       tion of 720 units per inch, while groff&apos;s ps device has 72000, a  refine&#8208;
       ment of factor 100.

       Today  the operating systems provide device drivers for most printer-like
       hardware, so it isn&apos;t necessary to write a special hardware postprocessor
       for each printer.

ROFF PROGRAMMING
       Documents  using  roff are normal text files decorated by roff formatting
       elements.  The roff formatting language is quite powerful; it is almost a
       full  programming language and provides elements to enlarge the language.
       With these, it became possible to develop macro packages  that  are  tai&#8208;
       lored  for  special  applications.   Such macro packages are much handier
       than plain roff.  So most people will choose a macro package without wor&#8208;
       rying about the internals of the roff language.

   Macro Packages
       Macro  packages  are  collections of macros that are suitable to format a
       special kind of documents in a convenient way.  This  greatly  eases  the
       usage  of  roff.   The  macro definitions of a package are kept in a file
       called name.tmac (classically tmac.name).  All tmac files are  stored  in
       one or more directories at standardized positions.  Details on the naming
       of macro packages and their placement is found in groff_tmac(5).

       A macro package that is to be used in a document can be announced to  the
       formatter by the command line option -m, see troff(1), or it can be spec&#8208;
       ified within a document using the file inclusion  requests  of  the  roff
       language, see groff(7).

       Famous  classical  macro packages are man for traditional man pages, mdoc
       for BSD-style manual pages; the macro sets for books, articles, and  let&#8208;
       ters are me (probably from the first name of its creator Eric Allman), ms
       (from Manuscript Macros), and mm (from Memorandum Macros).

   The roff Formatting Language
       The classical roff formatting language is documented in the Troff  User&apos;s
       Manual [CSTR #54].  The roff language is a full programming language pro&#8208;
       viding requests, definition of macros,  escape  sequences,  string  vari&#8208;
       ables, number or size registers, and flow controls.

       Requests are the predefined basic formatting commands similar to the com&#8208;
       mands at the shell prompt.  The user  can  define  request-like  elements
       using  predefined  roff elements.  These are then called macros.  A docu&#8208;
       ment writer will not note any difference in usage for requests or macros;
       both are written on a line on their own starting with a dot.

       Escape  sequences  are roff elements starting with a backslash `\&apos;.  They
       can be inserted anywhere, also in the midst of text in a line.  They  are
       used  to implement various features, including the insertion of non-ASCII
       characters with \(, font changes with \f, in-line comments with  \&quot;,  the
       escaping of special control characters like \\, and many other features.

       Strings are variables that can store a string.  A string is stored by the
       .ds request.  The stored string can be retrieved later by the  \*  escape
       sequence.

       Registers  store  numbers  and  sizes.   A  register  can be set with the
       request .nr and its value can be retrieved by the escape sequence \n.

FILE NAME EXTENSIONS
       Manual pages (man pages) take the section number as a  file  name  exten&#8208;
       sion, e.g., the filename for this document is roff.7, i.e., it is kept in
       section 7 of the man pages.

       The classical macro packages take the package name as an extension,  e.g.
       file.me  for  a  document  using  the  me  macro package, file.mm for mm,
       file.ms for ms, file.pic for pic files, etc.

       But there is no general naming scheme for roff documents, though  file.tr
       for  troff  file is seen now and then.  Maybe there should be a standard&#8208;
       ization for the filename extensions of roff files.

       File name extensions can be very handy in conjunction  with  the  less(1)
       pager.  It provides the possibility to feed all input into a command-line
       pipe that is specified in the shell environment variable LESSOPEN.   This
       process is not well documented, so here an example:

              LESSOPEN=&apos;|lesspipe %s&apos;

       where  lesspipe  is either a system supplied command or a shell script of
       your own.

EDITING ROFF
       The best program for editing a roff document is Emacs  (or  Xemacs),  see
       emacs(1).   It  provides  an nroff mode that is suitable for all kinds of
       roff dialects.  This mode can be activated by the following methods.

       When editing a file within Emacs the mode can be changed by  typing  `M-x
       nroff-mode&apos;,  where M-x means to hold down the Meta key (or Alt) and hit&#8208;
       ting the x key at the same time.

       But it is also possible to have the mode automatically selected when  the
       file is loaded into the editor.

       &#183;      The  most  general  method  is  to include the following 3 comment
              lines at the end of the file.

                     .\&quot; Local Variables:
                     .\&quot; mode: nroff
                     .\&quot; End:

       &#183;      There is a set of file name extensions, e.g. the  man  pages  that
              trigger the automatic activation of the nroff mode.

       &#183;      Theoretically, it is possible to write the sequence

                     .\&quot; -*- nroff -*-

              as  the first line of a file to have it started in nroff mode when
              loaded.  Unfortunately, some applications such as the man  program
              are confused by this; so this is deprecated.

       All roff formatters provide automated line breaks and horizontal and ver&#8208;
       tical spacing.  In order to not disturb this, the following tips  can  be
       helpful.

       &#183;      Never  include  empty or blank lines in a roff document.  Instead,
              use the empty request (a line consisting of a dot only) or a  line
              comment .\&quot; if a structuring element is needed.

       &#183;      Never  start a line with whitespace because this can lead to unex&#8208;
              pected behavior.  Indented paragraphs can be constructed in a con&#8208;
              trolled way by roff requests.

       &#183;      Start  each sentence on a line of its own, for the spacing after a
              dot is handled differently depending on whether it  terminates  an
              abbreviation  or a sentence.  To distinguish both cases, do a line
              break after each sentence.

       &#183;      To additionally use the auto-fill mode in Emacs,  it  is  best  to
              insert  an  empty  roff  request (a line consisting of a dot only)
              after each sentence.

       The following example shows how optimal roff editing could look.

              This is an example for a
              .I roff
              document.
              .
              This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.
              .
              This is a longer sentence stretching over several
              lines; abbreviations like `cf.&apos; are easily
              identified because the dot is not followed by a
              line break.
              .
              In the output, this will still go to the same
              paragraph.

       Besides Emacs, some other editors provide nroff  style  files  too,  e.g.
       vim(1), an extension of the vi(1) program.

       GNU roff
              The  groff  web  site &#10216;http://www.gnu.org/software/groff&#10217; provides
              the free roff implementation groff, the actual standard roff.

   Historical roff Documentation
       Many classical troff documents are still available on-line.  The two main
       manuals of the troff language are

       [CSTR #54]
              J. F. Ossanna, Nroff/Troff User&apos;s Manual &#10216;http://cm.bell-labs.com/
              cm/cs/cstr/54.ps.gz&#10217;; Bell Labs, 1976; revised by Brian Kernighan,
              1992.

              1982.

       The &#8220;little language&#8221; roff papers are

              Labs, April 1986.

   Manual Pages
       Due to its complex structure, a full roff system has many man pages, each
       describing  a  single aspect of roff.  Unfortunately, there is no general
       naming scheme for the documentation among the different roff  implementa&#8208;
       tions.
&#12;       In  groff,  the  man page groff(1) contains a survey of all documentation
       available in groff.

       On other systems, you are on your own,  but  troff(1)  might  be  a  good
       starting point.
