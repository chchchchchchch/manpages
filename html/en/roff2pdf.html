NAME
       roff2pdf - transform roff code into pdf mode

SYNOPSIS
       roff2pdf [groffer_option...] [--] [filespec...]
       roff2pdf -h | --help
       roff2pdf -v | --version

       The options -v and --version print the version information of the program
       to standard output and exit.  The options -h and  --help  print  a  usage
       information  of  the  program  to  standard  output  and stop the program
       instantly.

       All other options are assumed to be groffer options.  They are internally
       passed  to  groffer.   They  override  the  behavior of the program.  The
       options are optional, they can be omitted.

       The filespec arguments correspond to the filespec arguments  of  groffer.
       So  they  are either the names of existing, readable files or - for stan&#8208;
       dard input, or the name of a man page or a  groffer(1)  man  page  search
       pattern.  If no filespec is specified standard input is assumed automati&#8208;
       cally.
