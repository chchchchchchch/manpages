DESCRIPTION
       Route manipulates the kernel&apos;s IP routing tables.  Its primary use is  to
       set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via an interface after
       it has been configured with the ifconfig(8) program.

       When the add or del options are used, route modifies the routing  tables.
       Without these options, route displays the current contents of the routing
       tables.


OPTIONS
       -A family
              use the specified address family (eg `inet&apos;;  use  `route  --help&apos;
              for a full list).


       -F     operate  on the kernel&apos;s FIB (Forwarding Information Base) routing
              table.  This is the default.

       -C     operate on the kernel&apos;s routing cache.


       -v     select verbose operation.

       -n     show numerical addresses instead of trying to  determine  symbolic
              host  names. This is useful if you are trying to determine why the
              route to your nameserver has vanished.

       -e     use netstat(8)-format for displaying the routing table.  -ee  will
              generate a very long line with all parameters from the routing ta&#8208;
              ble.


       del    delete a route.

       add    add a new route.

       target the destination network or host. You can provide IP  addresses  in
              dotted decimal or host/network names.

       -net   the target is a network.

       -host  the target is a host.

       netmask NM
              when adding a network route, the netmask to be used.
&#12;       gw GW  route  packets via a gateway.  NOTE: The specified gateway must be
              reachable first. This usually means that you  have  to  set  up  a
              static route to the gateway beforehand. If you specify the address
              of one of your local interfaces, it will be used to  decide  about
              the  interface to which the packets should be routed to. This is a
              BSDism compatibility hack.

       metric M
              set the metric field in the routing table (used  by  routing  dae&#8208;
              mons) to M.

       mss M  set  the  TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for connections over this
              route to M bytes.  The default is the device MTU minus headers, or
              a  lower MTU when path mtu discovery occurred. This setting can be
              used to force smaller TCP packets on the other end when  path  mtu
              discovery  does  not  work (usually because of misconfigured fire&#8208;
              walls that block ICMP Fragmentation Needed)

       window W
              set the TCP window size for  connections  over  this  route  to  W
              bytes.  This  is  typically  only  used on AX.25 networks and with
              drivers unable to handle back to back frames.

       irtt I set the initial round trip time (irtt) for  TCP  connections  over
              this  route  to  I  milliseconds (1-12000). This is typically only
              used on AX.25 networks. If omitted the RFC 1122 default  of  300ms
              is used.

       reject install a blocking route, which will force a route lookup to fail.
              This is for example used to mask out  networks  before  using  the
              default route.  This is NOT for firewalling.

       mod, dyn, reinstate
              install  a dynamic or modified route. These flags are for diagnos&#8208;
              tic purposes, and are generally only set by routing daemons.

       dev If force the route to be associated with the specified device, as the
              kernel  will  otherwise try to determine the device on its own (by
              checking already existing routes and  device  specifications,  and
              where  the  route  is added to). In most normal networks you won&apos;t
              need this.

              If dev If is the last option on the command line, the word dev may
              be  omitted, as it&apos;s the default. Otherwise the order of the route
              modifiers (metric - netmask - gw - dev) doesn&apos;t matter.


EXAMPLES
       route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 dev lo
              adds the normal loopback entry, using netmask 255.0.0.0 and  asso&#8208;
              ciated  with  the &quot;lo&quot; device (assuming this device was previously
              set up correctly with ifconfig(8)).


       route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
              adds a route to the local network  192.56.76.x  via  &quot;eth0&quot;.   The
              word &quot;dev&quot; can be omitted here.


       route del default
              deletes  the  current default route, which is labeled &quot;default&quot; or
              0.0.0.0 in the destination field of the current routing table.


       route add default gw mango-gw
              adds a default route  (which  will  be  used  if  no  other  route
              matches).   All packets using this route will be gatewayed through
              &quot;mango-gw&quot;. The device which will actually be used for that  route
              depends  on  how  we  can  reach  &quot;mango-gw&quot; - the static route to
              &quot;mango-gw&quot; will have to be set up before.


       route add ipx4 sl0
              Adds the route to the &quot;ipx4&quot; host via the SLIP interface (assuming
              that &quot;ipx4&quot; is the SLIP host).


       route add -net 192.57.66.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw ipx4
              This  command  adds  the net &quot;192.57.66.x&quot; to be gatewayed through
              the former route to the SLIP interface.


       route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
              This is an obscure one documented so people know  how  to  do  it.
              This  sets  all  of  the  class  D (multicast) IP routes to go via
              &quot;eth0&quot;. This is the correct normal configuration line with a  mul&#8208;
              ticasting kernel.


       route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject
              This   installs   a   rejecting  route  for  the  private  network
              &quot;10.x.x.x.&quot;


OUTPUT
       The output of the kernel routing table is organized in the following col&#8208;
       umns

       Destination
              The destination network or destination host.

       Gateway
              The gateway address or &apos;*&apos; if none set.

       Genmask
              The  netmask for the destination net; &apos;255.255.255.255&apos; for a host
              destination and &apos;0.0.0.0&apos; for the default route.

       Flags  Possible flags include
              U (route is up)
              H (target is a host)
              G (use gateway)
              R (reinstate route for dynamic routing)
              D (dynamically installed by daemon or redirect)
              M (modified from routing daemon or redirect)
              A (installed by addrconf)
              C (cache entry)
              !  (reject route)

       Metric The &apos;distance&apos; to the target (usually counted in hops). It is  not
              used by recent kernels, but may be needed by routing daemons.

       Ref    Number  of  references  to this route. (Not used in the Linux ker&#8208;
              nel.)

       Use    Count of lookups for the route.  Depending on the use of -F and -C
              this will be either route cache misses (-F) or hits (-C).

       Iface  Interface to which packets for this route will be sent.

       MSS    Default maximum segment size for TCP connections over this route.

       Window Default window size for TCP connections over this route.
&#12;       irtt   Initial RTT (Round Trip Time). The kernel uses this to guess about
              the best TCP protocol  parameters  without  waiting  on  (possibly
              slow) answers.

       HH (cached only)
              The  number  of  ARP  entries  and cached routes that refer to the
              hardware header cache for the cached route. This will be -1  if  a
              hardware  address  is  not  needed for the interface of the cached
              route (e.g. lo).

       Arp (cached only)
              Whether or not the hardware address for the cached route is up  to
              date.

HISTORY
       Route   for  Linux  was  originally  written  by  Fred  N.   van  Kempen,
       &lt;waltje@uwalt.nl.mugnet.org&gt; and then modified  by  Johannes  Stille  and
       Linus  Torvalds  for  pl15. Alan Cox added the mss and window options for
       Linux 1.1.22. irtt support and merged with netstat from Bernd Eckenfels.
