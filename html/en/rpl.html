             Use a temporary directory for storing temporary files, usually the

             temporary files in the same directory as the file being modified.

     -a, --all
             Do not ignore files and directories starting with .

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     An effort has been made to make the program behave as much as the original
     rpl as necessary.  Where it has been possible to make improvements,
     improvements have been made.  This implementation lacks many of the bugs in
     the original.

EXAMPLES
     Replace all occurences of &#8220;F&#8221; (on word boundaries) with &#8220;A&#8221; in all text
     files under the grades/ directory:
           $ rpl -Rwd -x&apos;.txt&apos; &apos;F&apos; &apos;A&apos; grades/

SEE ALSO
     find(1), sed(1).

HISTORY
     This program was written for Debian as a free replacement for the non-free
     rpl program by Joe Laffey.
