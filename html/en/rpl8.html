rpl8(8)                                                                  rpl8(8)



NAME
       rpl8 - Firmware loader for DVD drives

SYNOPSIS
       rpl8 /dev/cdrom [-[dump-only]|firmwarefile]

DESCRIPTION
       rpl8  is a program for Linux 2.4 and upwards that uploads firmware to DVD
       drives (mostly DVD+RW).

       rpl8 stands for RICOH Program Loader 8, though it also  supports  Program
       Loader 9.

       The  program  never updates Program Loader code so that you should always
       be able to downgrade your firmware in case something goes wrong.

       So far rpl8 has been tested with the following:
       * HP dvd100i
       * Ricoh MP5120A
       * Philips DVDRW208
       * HP dvd200i

       To run rpl8 correctly, make sure you have no media in drive.   Optionally
       go to single user mode and reboot after uploading the new firmware.

OPTIONS
       -[dump-only]
              Only  backs  up  the firmware.  Note that you might have to reboot
              even after this.

BUGS
       Getting messages like this is &quot;normal&quot;

              ide-scsi: Strange, packet command initiated yet DRQ isn&apos;t asserted
