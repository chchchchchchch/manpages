RPMKEYS(8)                                                            RPMKEYS(8)



NAME
       rpmkeys - RPM Keyring

SYNOPSIS
       rpmkeys {--import|--checksig}


DESCRIPTION
       The general forms of rpm digital signature commands are

       rpmkeys --import PUBKEY ...

       rpmkeys {-K|--checksig} PACKAGE_FILE ...



       The  --checksig option checks all the digests and signatures contained in
       PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity and origin of the package. Note that
       signatures are now verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
       useful to verify all of the digests  and  signatures  associated  with  a
       package.

       Digital  signatures  cannot  be  verified without a public key.  An ASCII
       armored public key can be added to the rpm database  using  --import.  An
       imported  public  key  is carried in a header, and key ring management is
       performed exactly like package management.  For  example,  all  currently
       imported public keys can be displayed by:

       rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*

       Details  about  a specific public key, when imported, can be displayed by
       querying.  Here&apos;s information about the Red Hat GPG/DSA key:

       rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e

       Finally, public keys can be erased after importing  just  like  packages.
       Here&apos;s how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA key

       rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e

       rpmkeys --help - as rpm supports customizing the options via popt aliases
       it&apos;s impossible to guarantee that what&apos;s described in the manual  matches
       what&apos;s available.
