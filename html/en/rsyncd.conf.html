rsyncd.conf(5)                                                    rsyncd.conf(5)



NAME
       rsyncd.conf - configuration file for rsync in daemon mode

SYNOPSIS
       rsyncd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The rsyncd.conf file is the runtime configuration file for rsync when run
       as an rsync daemon.

       The rsyncd.conf file controls authentication, access, logging and  avail&#8208;
       able modules.

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists  of  modules and parameters. A module begins with the
       name of the module in square brackets and continues until the next module
       begins. Modules contain parameters of the form &quot;name = value&quot;.

       The  file  is  line-based -- that is, each newline-terminated line repre&#8208;
       sents either a comment, a module name or a parameter.

       Only the first equals sign in  a  parameter  is  significant.  Whitespace
       before or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading, trailing and
       internal whitespace in module and parameter names is irrelevant.  Leading
       and  trailing  whitespace  in  a  parameter  value is discarded. Internal
       whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim.

       Any line beginning with a hash (#) is ignored, as  are  lines  containing
       only whitespace.  Note that a hash in the middle of a line is used as-is,
       hence it is not possible to put a comment at the end of a parameter;  the
       hash and following text becomes part of the parameter.

       Any  line  ending in a \ is &quot;continued&quot; on the next line in the customary
       UNIX fashion.

       The values following the equals sign  in  parameters  are  all  either  a
       string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 0/1
       or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean  values,  but  is  pre&#8208;
       served in string values.

LAUNCHING THE RSYNC DAEMON
       The rsync daemon is launched by specifying the --daemon option to rsync.

       The  daemon  must  run with root privileges if you wish to use chroot, to
       bind to a port numbered under 1024 (as is the default  873),  or  to  set
       file  ownership.   Otherwise,  it  must  just have permission to read and
       write the appropriate data, log, and lock files.

       You can launch it either via inetd, as a stand-alone daemon, or  from  an
       rsync  client  via  a  remote shell.  If run as a stand-alone daemon then
       just run the command &quot;rsync --daemon&quot; from a suitable startup script.

       When run via inetd you should add a line like this to /etc/services:

         rsync           873/tcp


       and a single line something like this to /etc/inetd.conf:

         rsync   stream  tcp     nowait  root   /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon
&#12;       Replace &quot;/usr/bin/rsync&quot; with the path to where you have rsync  installed
       on your system.  You will then need to send inetd a HUP signal to tell it
       to reread its config file.

       Note that you should not send the rsync daemon a HUP signal to  force  it
       to  reread  the rsyncd.conf file. The file is re-read on each client con&#8208;
       nection.

GLOBAL PARAMETERS
       The first parameters in the file  (before  a  [module]  header)  are  the
       global parameters.

       You may also include any module parameters in the global part of the con&#8208;
       fig file in which case the supplied value will override the  default  for
       that parameter.

       motd file
              This  parameter  allows  you  to specify a &quot;message of the day&quot; to
              display to clients on each connect.  This  usually  contains  site
              information and any legal notices. The default is no motd file.

       pid file
              This  parameter  tells the rsync daemon to write its process ID to
              that file.  If the file already  exists,  the  rsync  daemon  will
              abort rather than overwrite the file.

       port   You  can  override  the  default port the daemon will listen on by
              specifying this value (defaults to 873).  This is ignored  if  the
              daemon is being run by inetd, and is superseded by the --port com&#8208;
              mand-line option.

       address
              You can override the default IP address the daemon will listen  on
              by  specifying this value.  This is ignored if the daemon is being
              run by inetd, and is  superseded  by  the  --address  command-line
              option.

       socket options
              This parameter can provide endless fun for people who like to tune
              their systems to the utmost degree.  You  can  set  all  sorts  of
              socket  options which may make transfers faster (or slower!). Read
              the man page for the setsockopt() system call for details on  some
              of  the  options  you  may  be  able to set. By default no special
              socket options are set.  These settings can also be specified  via
              the --sockopts command-line option.

MODULE PARAMETERS
       After  the  global parameters you should define a number of modules, each
       module exports a directory tree as a symbolic name. Modules are  exported
       by  specifying  a module name in square brackets [module] followed by the
       parameters for that module.  The module name cannot contain a slash or  a
       closing  square  bracket.  If the name contains whitespace, each internal
       sequence of whitespace will be changed into a single space, while leading
       or trailing whitespace will be discarded.

       comment
              This  parameter  specifies  a description string that is displayed
              next to the module name when clients obtain a  list  of  available
              modules. The default is no comment.

       path   This  parameter specifies the directory in the daemon&#8217;s filesystem
              to make available in this module.  You must specify this parameter
              for each module in rsyncd.conf.

              It  is  fine  if the path includes internal spaces -- they will be
              retained verbatim (which means that you shouldn&#8217;t  try  to  escape
              them).   If your final directory has a trailing space (and this is
              somehow not something you wish to fix), append a trailing slash to
              the path to avoid losing the trailing whitespace.

       use chroot
              If  &quot;use  chroot&quot;  is  true,  the  rsync daemon will chroot to the
              &quot;path&quot; before starting the file transfer with  the  client.   This
              has the advantage of extra protection against possible implementa&#8208;
              tion security holes, but it has  the  disadvantages  of  requiring
              super-user  privileges, of not being able to follow symbolic links
              that are either absolute or outside of the new root path,  and  of
              complicating  the  preservation  of  users and groups by name (see
              below).

              As an additional safety feature, you can specify a dot-dir in  the
              module&#8217;s  &quot;path&quot;  to  indicate  the  point where the chroot should
              occur.  This allows rsync to run in a chroot with a  non-&quot;/&quot;  path
              for  the top of the transfer hierarchy.  Doing this guards against
              unintended library loading (since those absolute paths will not be
              inside the transfer hierarchy unless you have used an unwise path&#8208;
              name), and lets you setup libraries for the chroot that  are  out&#8208;
              side  of the transfer.  For example, specifying &quot;/var/rsync/./mod&#8208;
              ule1&quot; will chroot  to  the  &quot;/var/rsync&quot;  directory  and  set  the
              inside-chroot path to &quot;/module1&quot;.  If you had omitted the dot-dir,
              the chroot would have used the whole path, and  the  inside-chroot
              path would have been &quot;/&quot;.

              When  &quot;use  chroot&quot; is false or the inside-chroot path is not &quot;/&quot;,
              rsync will: (1) munge symlinks by  default  for  security  reasons
              (see  &quot;munge symlinks&quot; for a way to turn this off, but only if you
              trust your users), (2)  substitute  leading  slashes  in  absolute
              paths   with   the   module&#8217;s   path  (so  that  options  such  as
              --backup-dir, --compare-dest, etc. interpret an absolute  path  as
              rooted  in  the  module&#8217;s &quot;path&quot; dir), and (3) trim &quot;..&quot; path ele&#8208;
              ments from args if rsync believes they  would  escape  the  module
              hierarchy.  The default for &quot;use chroot&quot; is true, and is the safer
              choice (especially if the module is not read-only).

              When this parameter is enabled, rsync  will  not  attempt  to  map
              users  and  groups  by  name (by default), but instead copy IDs as
              though --numeric-ids had  been  specified.   In  order  to  enable
              name-mapping,  rsync  needs to be able to use the standard library
              functions for looking up names and IDs (i.e.   getpwuid()  ,  get&#8208;
              grgid()  ,  getpwname()  , and getgrnam() ).  This means the rsync
              process in the chroot hierarchy will need to have  access  to  the
              resources   used   by   these   library  functions  (traditionally
              /etc/passwd  and  /etc/group,  but  perhaps   additional   dynamic
              libraries as well).

              If you copy the necessary resources into the module&#8217;s chroot area,
              you should protect them through your OS&#8217;s normal user/group or ACL
              settings  (to  prevent  the rsync module&#8217;s user from being able to
              change them),  and  then  hide  them  from  the  user&#8217;s  view  via
              &quot;exclude&quot;  (see how in the discussion of that parameter).  At that
              point it will be safe to enable the mapping of users and groups by
              name using the &quot;numeric ids&quot; daemon parameter (see below).

              Note also that you are free to setup custom user/group information
              in the chroot area that is different from your normal system.  For
              example, you could abbreviate the list of users and groups.

       numeric ids
              Enabling  this  parameter disables the mapping of users and groups
              by name for the current daemon module.  This prevents  the  daemon
              from  trying  to  load  any user/group-related files or libraries.
              This enabling makes the transfer  behave  as  if  the  client  had
              passed  the  --numeric-ids  command-line option.  By default, this
              parameter  is  enabled  for  chroot  modules  and   disabled   for
              non-chroot modules.

              A  chroot-enabled  module  should  not have this parameter enabled
              unless you&#8217;ve taken steps to ensure that the module has the neces&#8208;
              sary  resources  it  needs  to translate names, and that it is not
              possible for a user to change those resources.

       munge symlinks
              This parameter tells rsync to modify all incoming  symlinks  in  a
              way  that  makes  them unusable but recoverable (see below).  This
              should help protect your files from user trickery when your daemon
              module  is writable.  The default is disabled when &quot;use chroot&quot; is
              on and the inside-chroot path is &quot;/&quot;, otherwise it is enabled.

              If you disable this parameter on a daemon that is  not  read-only,
              there  are  tricks  that a user can play with uploaded symlinks to
              access daemon-excluded items (if your module  has  any),  and,  if
              &quot;use  chroot&quot;  is  off,  rsync can even be tricked into showing or
              changing data that is outside the module&#8217;s path (as access-permis&#8208;
              sions allow).

              The  way  rsync disables the use of symlinks is to prefix each one
              with the string &quot;/rsyncd-munged/&quot;.  This prevents the  links  from
              being  used  as  long as that directory does not exist.  When this
              parameter is enabled, rsync will refuse to run if that path  is  a
              directory or a symlink to a directory.  When using the &quot;munge sym&#8208;
              links&quot; parameter in a chroot area that has an  inside-chroot  path
              of  &quot;/&quot;,  you  should add &quot;/rsyncd-munged/&quot; to the exclude setting
              for the module so that a user can&#8217;t try to create it.

              Note:  rsync makes no attempt to verify that any pre-existing sym&#8208;
              links in the module&#8217;s hierarchy are as safe as you want them to be
              (unless, of course, it just copied in the  whole  hierarchy).   If
              you  setup  an rsync daemon on a new area or locally add symlinks,
              you can manually protect your symlinks from being abused  by  pre&#8208;
              fixing  &quot;/rsyncd-munged/&quot;  to  the start of every symlink&#8217;s value.
              There is a perl script in the support directory of the source code
              named &quot;munge-symlinks&quot; that can be used to add or remove this pre&#8208;
              fix from your symlinks.

              When this parameter is disabled on  a  writable  module  and  &quot;use
              chroot&quot;  is  off  (or the inside-chroot path is not &quot;/&quot;), incoming
              symlinks will be modified to drop a leading slash  and  to  remove
              &quot;..&quot;  path  elements  that  rsync believes will allow a symlink to
              escape the module&#8217;s hierarchy.  There  are  tricky  ways  to  work
              around  this,  though,  so  you had better trust your users if you
              choose this combination of parameters.

       charset
              This specifies the name of the character set in which the module&#8217;s
              filenames  are  stored.  If the client uses an --iconv option, the
              daemon will use the value of the &quot;charset&quot; parameter regardless of
              the  character  set  the  client actually passed.  This allows the
              daemon to support charset conversion in a  chroot  module  without
              extra  files in the chroot area, and also ensures that name-trans&#8208;
              lation is done in a consistent manner.  If the &quot;charset&quot; parameter
              is  not set, the --iconv option is refused, just as if &quot;iconv&quot; had
              been specified via &quot;refuse options&quot;.

              If you wish to force users to always use --iconv for a  particular
              module, add &quot;no-iconv&quot; to the &quot;refuse options&quot; parameter.  Keep in
              mind that this will restrict access to your  module  to  very  new
              rsync clients.
&#12;       max connections
              This  parameter allows you to specify the maximum number of simul&#8208;
              taneous connections you will allow.  Any clients  connecting  when
              the  maximum  has been reached will receive a message telling them
              to try later.  The default is 0, which means no limit.  A negative
              value disables the module.  See also the &quot;lock file&quot; parameter.

       log file
              When  the  &quot;log  file&quot; parameter is set to a non-empty string, the
              rsync daemon will log messages to the indicated file  rather  than
              using syslog. This is particularly useful on systems (such as AIX)
              where syslog() doesn&#8217;t work for chrooted programs.   The  file  is
              opened before chroot() is called, allowing it to be placed outside
              the transfer.  If this value is set on a per-module basis  instead
              of  globally,  the global log will still contain any authorization
              failures or config-file error messages.

              If the daemon fails to open the specified file, it will fall  back
              to using syslog and output an error about the failure.  (Note that
              the failure to open the specified log file  used  to  be  a  fatal
              error.)

       syslog facility
              This  parameter  allows you to specify the syslog facility name to
              use when logging messages from the rsync daemon. You may  use  any
              standard  syslog  facility  name  which is defined on your system.
              Common names are auth, authpriv, cron,  daemon,  ftp,  kern,  lpr,
              mail,  news, security, syslog, user, uucp, local0, local1, local2,
              local3, local4, local5, local6 and local7. The default is  daemon.
              This  setting  has  no  effect  if  the  &quot;log  file&quot;  setting is a
              non-empty string (either  set  in  the  per-modules  settings,  or
              inherited from the global settings).

       max verbosity
              This parameter allows you to control the maximum amount of verbose
              information that you&#8217;ll allow the daemon to  generate  (since  the
              information  goes  into  the  log  file).  The default is 1, which
              allows the client to request one level of verbosity.

       lock file
              This parameter specifies the file to use to support the &quot;max  con&#8208;
              nections&quot;  parameter. The rsync daemon uses record locking on this
              file to ensure that the max connections limit is not exceeded  for
              the   modules   sharing   the   lock   file.    The   default   is
              /var/run/rsyncd.lock.

       read only
              This parameter determines whether clients will be able  to  upload
              files  or  not.  If &quot;read only&quot; is true then any attempted uploads
              will fail. If &quot;read only&quot; is false then uploads will  be  possible
              if  file permissions on the daemon side allow them. The default is
              for all modules to be read only.

       write only
              This parameter determines whether clients will be able to download
              files or not. If &quot;write only&quot; is true then any attempted downloads
              will fail. If &quot;write only&quot; is false then downloads will be  possi&#8208;
              ble  if  file  permissions  on  the  daemon  side allow them.  The
              default is for this parameter to be disabled.

       list   This parameter determines if this module should be listed when the
              client asks for a listing of available modules. By setting this to
              false you can create hidden modules. The default is for modules to
              be listable.

       uid    This parameter specifies the user name or user ID that file trans&#8208;
              fers to and from that module should take place as when the  daemon
              was  run  as  root.  In  combination with the &quot;gid&quot; parameter this
              determines what file permissions are available. The default is uid
              -2, which is normally the user &quot;nobody&quot;.

       gid    This  parameter  specifies  the  group  name or group ID that file
              transfers to and from that module should take place  as  when  the
              daemon  was run as root. This complements the &quot;uid&quot; parameter. The
              default is gid -2, which is normally the group &quot;nobody&quot;.

       fake super
              Setting &quot;fake super = yes&quot; for a module causes the daemon side  to
              behave  as if the --fake-super command-line option had been speci&#8208;
              fied.  This allows the full attributes of  a  file  to  be  stored
              without having to have the daemon actually running as root.

       filter The  daemon has its own filter chain that determines what files it
              will let the client access.  This chain is not sent to the  client
              and  is  independent of any filters the client may have specified.
              Files excluded by the daemon filter chain (daemon-excluded  files)
              are  treated as non-existent if the client tries to pull them, are
              skipped with an error message if the client  tries  to  push  them
              (triggering  exit code 23), and are never deleted from the module.
              You can use daemon filters to prevent clients from downloading  or
              tampering with private administrative files, such as files you may
              add to support uid/gid name translations.

              The daemon filter chain  is  built  from  the  &quot;filter&quot;,  &quot;include
              from&quot;,  &quot;include&quot;,  &quot;exclude  from&quot;,  and &quot;exclude&quot; parameters, in
              that order of priority.  Anchored patterns  are  anchored  at  the
              root  of  the module.  To prevent access to an entire subtree, for
              example, &quot;/secret&quot;, you must exclude everything  in  the  subtree;
              the  easiest  way  to  do  this is with a triple-star pattern like
              &quot;/secret/***&quot;.

              The &quot;filter&quot; parameter takes a space-separated list of daemon fil&#8208;
              ter  rules, though it is smart enough to know not to split a token
              at an internal space in a rule (e.g. &quot;- /foo  - /bar&quot; is parsed as
              two  rules).   You  may specify one or more merge-file rules using
              the normal syntax.  Only one &quot;filter&quot; parameter  can  apply  to  a
              given  module in the config file, so put all the rules you want in
              a single parameter.  Note that per-directory merge-file  rules  do
              not  provide  as  much protection as global rules, but they can be
              used to make --delete work better during a client download  opera&#8208;
              tion  if  the per-dir merge files are included in the transfer and
              the client requests that they be used.

       exclude
              This parameter takes a space-separated list of daemon exclude pat&#8208;
              terns.  As with the client --exclude option, patterns can be qual&#8208;
              ified with &quot;- &quot; or &quot;+ &quot; to  explicitly  indicate  exclude/include.
              Only one &quot;exclude&quot; parameter can apply to a given module.  See the
              &quot;filter&quot; parameter for a description of how excluded files  affect
              the daemon.

       include
              Use  an &quot;include&quot; to override the effects of the &quot;exclude&quot; parame&#8208;
              ter.  Only one &quot;include&quot; parameter can apply to  a  given  module.
              See the &quot;filter&quot; parameter for a description of how excluded files
              affect the daemon.

       exclude from
              This parameter specifies the name of a file  on  the  daemon  that
              contains daemon exclude patterns, one per line.  Only one &quot;exclude
              from&quot; parameter can apply to a given module; if you have  multiple
              exclude-from  files,  you  can specify them as a merge file in the
              &quot;filter&quot; parameter.  See the &quot;filter&quot; parameter for a  description
              of how excluded files affect the daemon.

       include from
              Analogue  of &quot;exclude from&quot; for a file of daemon include patterns.
              Only one &quot;include from&quot; parameter can apply  to  a  given  module.
              See the &quot;filter&quot; parameter for a description of how excluded files
              affect the daemon.

       incoming chmod
              This parameter allows you to  specify  a  set  of  comma-separated
              chmod  strings  that  will  affect the permissions of all incoming
              files (files that  are  being  received  by  the  daemon).   These
              changes  happen  after all other permission calculations, and this
              will even override destination-default and/or existing permissions
              when  the client does not specify --perms.  See the description of
              the --chmod rsync option and the chmod(1) manpage for  information
              on the format of this string.

       outgoing chmod
              This  parameter  allows  you  to  specify a set of comma-separated
              chmod strings that will affect the  permissions  of  all  outgoing
              files  (files  that  are  being  sent out from the daemon).  These
              changes happen first, making the sent  permissions  appear  to  be
              different  than  those  stored  in  the  filesystem  itself.   For
              instance, you could disable group write permissions on the  server
              while  having it appear to be on to the clients.  See the descrip&#8208;
              tion of the --chmod rsync option  and  the  chmod(1)  manpage  for
              information on the format of this string.

       auth users
              This parameter specifies a comma and space-separated list of user&#8208;
              names that will be allowed to connect to this  module.  The  user&#8208;
              names  do not need to exist on the local system. The usernames may
              also contain shell wildcard characters. If  &quot;auth  users&quot;  is  set
              then  the client will be challenged to supply a username and pass&#8208;
              word to connect to the module. A challenge response authentication
              protocol  is  used for this exchange. The plain text usernames and
              passwords are stored in the file specified by the  &quot;secrets  file&quot;
              parameter.  The  default  is  for  all users to be able to connect
              without a password (this is called &quot;anonymous rsync&quot;).

              See also the section entitled &quot;USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES  VIA  A
              REMOTE SHELL CONNECTION&quot; in rsync(1) for information on how handle
              an   rsyncd.conf-level   username   that    differs    from    the
              remote-shell-level  username  when using a remote shell to connect
              to an rsync daemon.

       secrets file
              This parameter specifies the name of  a  file  that  contains  the
              username:password  pairs used for authenticating this module. This
              file is only consulted if the &quot;auth users&quot; parameter is specified.
              The  file is line based and contains username:password pairs sepa&#8208;
              rated by a single colon. Any line starting with a hash (#) is con&#8208;
              sidered  a  comment  and is skipped. The passwords can contain any
              characters but be warned that many  operating  systems  limit  the
              length  of  passwords  that can be typed at the client end, so you
              may find that passwords longer than 8 characters don&#8217;t work.

              There is no default for the &quot;secrets  file&quot;  parameter,  you  must
              choose  a  name (such as /etc/rsyncd.secrets).  The file must nor&#8208;
              mally not be readable by &quot;other&quot;; see &quot;strict modes&quot;.

       strict modes
              This parameter determines whether or not the  permissions  on  the
              secrets file will be checked.  If &quot;strict modes&quot; is true, then the
              secrets file must not be readable by any user ID  other  than  the
              one  that the rsync daemon is running under.  If &quot;strict modes&quot; is
              false, the check is not performed.  The  default  is  true.   This
              parameter  was  added  to accommodate rsync running on the Windows
              operating system.

       hosts allow
              This parameter allows you to specify a list of patterns  that  are
              matched  against  a connecting clients hostname and IP address. If
              none of the patterns match then the connection is rejected.

              Each pattern can be in one of five forms:

              o      a dotted decimal IPv4 address of the form  a.b.c.d,  or  an
                     IPv6  address  of  the  form a:b:c::d:e:f. In this case the
                     incoming machine&#8217;s IP address must match exactly.

              o      an address/mask in the form ipaddr/n where ipaddr is the IP
                     address  and  n  is  the number of one bits in the netmask.
                     All IP addresses which match the masked IP address will  be
                     allowed in.

              o      an address/mask in the form ipaddr/maskaddr where ipaddr is
                     the IP address and maskaddr is the netmask in dotted  deci&#8208;
                     mal   notation   for   IPv4,  or  similar  for  IPv6,  e.g.
                     ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:: instead  of  /64.  All  IP  addresses
                     which match the masked IP address will be allowed in.

              o      a  hostname. The hostname as determined by a reverse lookup
                     will be matched (case  insensitive)  against  the  pattern.
                     Only an exact match is allowed in.

              o      a hostname pattern using wildcards. These are matched using
                     the same rules as normal unix  filename  matching.  If  the
                     pattern matches then the client is allowed in.


              Note  IPv6  link-local  addresses  can have a scope in the address
              specification:

                  fe80::1%link1
                  fe80::%link1/64
                  fe80::%link1/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::


              You can also combine &quot;hosts allow&quot; with a  separate  &quot;hosts  deny&quot;
              parameter. If both parameters are specified then the &quot;hosts allow&quot;
              parameter is checked first and a match results in the client being
              able  to connect. The &quot;hosts deny&quot; parameter is then checked and a
              match means that the host is rejected. If the host does not  match
              either  the  &quot;hosts allow&quot; or the &quot;hosts deny&quot; patterns then it is
              allowed to connect.

              The default is no &quot;hosts allow&quot; parameter, which means  all  hosts
              can connect.

       hosts deny
              This  parameter  allows you to specify a list of patterns that are
              matched against a connecting clients hostname and IP  address.  If
              the  pattern  matches  then  the  connection  is rejected. See the
              &quot;hosts allow&quot; parameter for more information.

              The default is no &quot;hosts deny&quot; parameter, which  means  all  hosts
              can connect.

       ignore errors
              This  parameter  tells  rsyncd  to ignore I/O errors on the daemon
              when deciding whether to run the delete  phase  of  the  transfer.
              Normally  rsync  skips  the  --delete  step if any I/O errors have
              occurred in order to prevent disastrous deletion due to  a  tempo&#8208;
              rary resource shortage or other I/O error. In some cases this test
              is counter productive so you can use this parameter  to  turn  off
              this behavior.

       ignore nonreadable
              This  tells  the  rsync daemon to completely ignore files that are
              not readable by the user. This is useful for public archives  that
              may  have  some  non-readable files among the directories, and the
              sysadmin doesn&#8217;t want those files to be seen at all.

       transfer logging
              This parameter enables per-file logging of downloads  and  uploads
              in  a  format  somewhat  similar to that used by ftp daemons.  The
              daemon always logs the transfer at the end, so if  a  transfer  is
              aborted, no mention will be made in the log file.

              If  you  want  to  customize  the  log lines, see the &quot;log format&quot;
              parameter.

       log format
              This parameter allows you to specify the format used  for  logging
              file  transfers when transfer logging is enabled.  The format is a
              text string containing embedded single-character escape  sequences
              prefixed  with a percent (%) character.  An optional numeric field
              width may also be specified between the  percent  and  the  escape
              letter (e.g. &quot;%-50n %8l %07p&quot;).

              The  default  log  format is &quot;%o %h [%a] %m (%u) %f %l&quot;, and a &quot;%t
              [%p] &quot; is always prefixed when using the &quot;log file&quot; parameter.  (A
              perl  script  that  will  summarize  this  default  log  format is
              included in the rsync source code distribution  in  the  &quot;support&quot;
              subdirectory: rsyncstats.)

              The single-character escapes that are understood are as follows:

              o      %a the remote IP address

              o      %b the number of bytes actually transferred

              o      %B the permission bits of the file (e.g. rwxrwxrwt)

              o      %c  the  total size of the block checksums received for the
                     basis file (only when sending)

              o      %f the filename (long form on sender; no trailing &quot;/&quot;)

              o      %G the gid of the file (decimal) or &quot;DEFAULT&quot;

              o      %h the remote host name

              o      %i an itemized list of what is being updated

              o      %l the length of the file in bytes

              o      %L the string &quot; -&gt; SYMLINK&quot;, &quot; =&gt; HARDLINK&quot;, or  &quot;&quot;  (where
                     SYMLINK or HARDLINK is a filename)

              o      %m the module name

              o      %M the last-modified time of the file

              o      %n the filename (short form; trailing &quot;/&quot; on dir)

              o      %o  the  operation, which is &quot;send&quot;, &quot;recv&quot;, or &quot;del.&quot; (the
                     latter includes the trailing period)

              o      %p the process ID of this rsync session
&#12;              o      %P the module path

              o      %t the current date time

              o      %u the authenticated username or an empty string

              o      %U the uid of the file (decimal)


              For a list of what the characters mean that are  output  by  &quot;%i&quot;,
              see the --itemize-changes option in the rsync manpage.

              Note  that  some  of  the  logged output changes when talking with
              older rsync versions.  For instance, deleted files were only  out&#8208;
              put as verbose messages prior to rsync 2.6.4.

       timeout
              This  parameter  allows you to override the clients choice for I/O
              timeout for this module. Using this parameter you can ensure  that
              rsync  won&#8217;t  wait on a dead client forever. The timeout is speci&#8208;
              fied in seconds. A value of zero  means  no  timeout  and  is  the
              default.  A  good  choice  for  anonymous rsync daemons may be 600
              (giving a 10 minute timeout).

       refuse options
              This parameter allows you to specify  a  space-separated  list  of
              rsync command line options that will be refused by your rsync dae&#8208;
              mon.  You may specify the full option name, its one-letter  abbre&#8208;
              viation, or a wild-card string that matches multiple options.  For
              example, this would refuse --checksum (-c)  and  all  the  various
              delete options:

                  refuse options = c delete


              The  reason  the  above  refuses  all  delete  options is that the
              options imply --delete, and implied options are refused just  like
              explicit options.  As an additional safety feature, the refusal of
              &quot;delete&quot; also refuses remove-source-files when the daemon  is  the
              sender;  if you want the latter without the former, instead refuse
              &quot;delete-*&quot; -- that refuses all the delete modes without  affecting
              --remove-source-files.

              When  an option is refused, the daemon prints an error message and
              exits.  To prevent all compression when serving files, you can use
              &quot;dont  compress = *&quot; (see below) instead of &quot;refuse options = com&#8208;
              press&quot; to avoid returning an error to a client that requests  com&#8208;
              pression.

       dont compress
              This  parameter  allows  you to select filenames based on wildcard
              patterns that should not be compressed when pulling files from the
              daemon  (no  analogous  parameter  exists to govern the pushing of
              files to a daemon).  Compression is  expensive  in  terms  of  CPU
              usage,  so  it  is  usually good to not try to compress files that
              won&#8217;t compress well, such as already compressed files.

              The &quot;dont compress&quot; parameter  takes  a  space-separated  list  of
              case-insensitive  wildcard  patterns. Any source filename matching
              one of the patterns will not be compressed during transfer.

              See the --skip-compress parameter in the rsync(1) manpage for  the
              list  of file suffixes that are not compressed by default.  Speci&#8208;
              fying a value  for  the  &quot;dont  compress&quot;  parameter  changes  the
              default when the daemon is the sender.

       pre-xfer exec, post-xfer exec
              You may specify a command to be run before and/or after the trans&#8208;
              fer.  If the pre-xfer exec command fails, the transfer is  aborted
              before it begins.

              The  following  environment variables will be set, though some are
              specific to the pre-xfer or the post-xfer environment:

              o      RSYNC_MODULE_NAME: The name of the module being accessed.

              o      RSYNC_MODULE_PATH: The path configured for the module.

              o      RSYNC_HOST_ADDR: The accessing host&#8217;s IP address.

              o      RSYNC_HOST_NAME: The accessing host&#8217;s name.

              o      RSYNC_USER_NAME: The accessing user&#8217;s  name  (empty  if  no
                     user).

              o      RSYNC_PID: A unique number for this transfer.

              o      RSYNC_REQUEST:  (pre-xfer only) The module/path info speci&#8208;
                     fied by the user (note that the user can  specify  multiple
                     source   files,  so  the  request  can  be  something  like
                     &quot;mod/path1 mod/path2&quot;, etc.).

              o      RSYNC_ARG#: (pre-xfer only) The pre-request  arguments  are
                     set   in   these  numbered  values.  RSYNC_ARG0  is  always
                     &quot;rsyncd&quot;, and the last value contains a single period.

              o      RSYNC_EXIT_STATUS: (post-xfer only) the server side&#8217;s  exit
                     value.   This  will  be  0 for a successful run, a positive
                     value for an error that the server generated, or  a  -1  if
                     rsync  failed  to  exit  properly.  Note that an error that
                     occurs on the client side does not currently  get  sent  to
                     the  server  side, so this is not the final exit status for
                     the whole transfer.

              o      RSYNC_RAW_STATUS: (post-xfer only) the raw exit value  from
                     waitpid() .


              Even  though the commands can be associated with a particular mod&#8208;
              ule, they are run using the permissions of the user  that  started
              the  daemon  (not the module&#8217;s uid/gid setting) without any chroot
              restrictions.

AUTHENTICATION STRENGTH
       The authentication protocol used in rsync is a 128 bit  MD4  based  chal&#8208;
       lenge  response  system.  This is fairly weak protection, though (with at
       least one brute-force hash-finding algorithm publicly available),  so  if
       you want really top-quality security, then I recommend that you run rsync
       over ssh.  (Yes, a future version of rsync will switch over to a stronger
       hashing method.)

       Also  note  that the rsync daemon protocol does not currently provide any
       encryption of the data that is  transferred  over  the  connection.  Only
       authentication  is provided. Use ssh as the transport if you want encryp&#8208;
       tion.

       Future versions of rsync may support SSL for  better  authentication  and
       encryption, but that is still being investigated.

EXAMPLES
       A  simple  rsyncd.conf  file  that allow anonymous rsync to a ftp area at
       /home/ftp would be:

       [ftp]
               path = /home/ftp
               comment = ftp export area
&#12;
       A more sophisticated example would be:

       uid = nobody
       gid = nobody
       use chroot = yes
       max connections = 4
       syslog facility = local5
       pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid

       [ftp]
               path = /var/ftp/./pub
               comment = whole ftp area (approx 6.1 GB)

       [sambaftp]
               path = /var/ftp/./pub/samba
               comment = Samba ftp area (approx 300 MB)

       [rsyncftp]
               path = /var/ftp/./pub/rsync
               comment = rsync ftp area (approx 6 MB)

       [sambawww]
               path = /public_html/samba
               comment = Samba WWW pages (approx 240 MB)

       [cvs]
               path = /data/cvs
               comment = CVS repository (requires authentication)
               auth users = tridge, susan
               secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets



       The /etc/rsyncd.secrets file would look something like this:

              tridge:mypass
              susan:herpass
