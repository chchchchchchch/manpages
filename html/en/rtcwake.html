RTCWAKE(8)                    System Administration                   RTCWAKE(8)



NAME
       rtcwake - enter a system sleep state until specified wakeup time

SYNOPSIS
       rtcwake [-hvVluan] [-d device] [-m standby_mode] {-t time_t|-s seconds}

DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to enter a system sleep state until specified wakeup
       time.

       This uses cross-platform Linux interfaces to enter a system sleep  state,
       and  leave  it no later than a specified time.  It uses any RTC framework
       driver that supports standard driver model wakeup flags.

       This is normally used like the old apmsleep utility, to wake from a  sus&#8208;
       pend state like ACPI S1 (standby) or S3 (suspend-to-RAM).  Most platforms
       can implement those without analogues of BIOS, APM, or ACPI.

       On some systems, this can also be used  like  nvram-wakeup,  waking  from
       states  like  ACPI S4 (suspend to disk).  Not all systems have persistent
       media that are appropriate for such suspend modes.

   Options
       -v | --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -h | --help
              Display a short help message that shows how to use the program.

       -V | --version
              Displays version information and exists.

       -n | --dry-run
              This option does everything but actually setup alarm, suspend sys&#8208;
              tem or wait for the alarm.

       -a | --auto
              Reads  the clock mode (whether the hardware clock is set to UTC or
              local time) from  /etc/adjtime.  That&apos;s  the  location  where  the
              hwclock(8) stores that information. This is the default.

       -l | --local
              Assumes  that  the hardware clock is set to local time, regardless
              of the contents of /etc/adjtime.

       -u | --utc
              Assumes that the hardware clock is  set  to  UTC  (Universal  Time
              Coordinated), regardless of the contents of /etc/adjtime.

       -d device | --device device
              Uses device instead of rtc0 as realtime clock. This option is only
              relevant if your system has more than one  RTC.  You  may  specify
              rtc1, rtc2, ... here.

       -s seconds | --seconds seconds
              Sets the wakeup time to seconds in future from now.

       -t time_t | --time time_t
              Sets  the  wakeup  time to the absolute time time_t. time_t is the
              time in seconds since 1970-01-01, 00:00 UTC. Use the date(1)  tool
              to convert between human-readable time and time_t.
&#12;       -m mode | --mode mode
              Use standby state mode. Valid values are:

              standby
                     ACPI  state  S1.  This  state  offers minimal, though real,
                     power savings, while providing a very  low-latency  transi&#8208;
                     tion back to a working system. This is the default mode.

              mem    ACPI  state S3 (Suspend-to-RAM). This state offers signifi&#8208;
                     cant power savings as everything in the system is put  into
                     a  low-power  state,  except for memory, which is placed in
                     self-refresh mode to retain its contents.

              disk   ACPI state S4  (Suspend-to-disk).  This  state  offers  the
                     greatest power savings, and can be used even in the absence
                     of low-level platform support for  power  management.  This
                     state  operates similarly to Suspend-to-RAM, but includes a
                     final step of writing memory contents to disk.

              off    ACPI  state  S5  (Poweroff).  This  is  done   by   calling
                     &apos;/sbin/shutdown&apos;.   Not  officially  supported by ACPI, but
                     usually working.

              no     Don&apos;t suspend. The rtcwake command  sets  RTC  wakeup  time
                     only.

              on     Don&apos;t  suspend,  but  read  RTC  device  until  alarm  time
                     appears. This mode is useful for debugging.

              disable
                     Disable previously set alarm.

              show   Print alarm information in format: &quot;alarm: off|on  &lt;time&gt;&quot;.
                     The  time is in ctime() output format, e.g. &quot;alarm: on  Tue
                     Nov 16 04:48:45 2010&quot;.

NOTES
       Some PC systems can&apos;t currently exit sleep states such as mem using  only
       the  kernel  code accessed by this driver.  They need help from userspace
       code to make the framebuffer work again.

HISTORY
       The program was posted several times  on  LKML  and  other  lists  before
       appearing  in  kernel  commit  message  for  Linux  2.6 in the GIT commit
       87ac84f42a7a580d0dd72ae31d6a5eb4bfe04c6d.

       The rtcwake command is part of the util-linux package  and  is  available
       from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
