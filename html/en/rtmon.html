RTMON(8)                                                                RTMON(8)



NAME
       rtmon - listens to and monitors RTnetlink

SYNOPSIS
       rtmon [ options ] file FILE [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rtmon command.

       rtmon listens on netlink socket and monitors routing table changes.

       rtmon  can  be  started before the first network configuration command is
       issued.  For example if you insert:

       rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log

       in a startup script, you will be able to view  the  full  history  later.
       Certainly,  it  is  possible  to start rtmon at any time. It prepends the
       history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment of starting.


OPTIONS
       rtmon supports the following options:

       -Version
              Print version and exit.

       help   Show summary of options.

       file FILE [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]
              Log output to FILE. LISTofOBJECTS is the list of object types that
              we want to monitor.  It may contain &apos;link&apos;, &apos;address&apos;, &apos;route&apos; and
              &apos;all&apos;. &apos;link&apos; specifies the network device, &apos;address&apos; the protocol
              (IP  or IPv6) address on a device, &apos;route&apos; the routing table entry
              and &apos;all&apos; does what the name says.

       -family [ inet | inet6 | link | help ]
              Specify protocol family. &apos;inet&apos; is IPv4, &apos;inet6&apos; is  IPv6,  &apos;link&apos;
              means  that  no  networking protocol is involved and &apos;help&apos; prints
              usage information.

       -4     Use IPv4. Shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     Use IPv6. Shortcut for -family inet6.

       -0     Use a special family identifier meaning that no networking  proto&#8208;
              col is involved. Shortcut for -family link.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       # rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log
              Log to file /var/log/rtmon.log, then run:

       # ip monitor file /var/log/rtmon.log
              to display logged output from file.
