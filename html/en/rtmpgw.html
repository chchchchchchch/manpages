DESCRIPTION
       rtmpgw is a server for streaming media content from RTMP out to HTTP.

       rtmpgw listens for HTTP requests that specify RTMP stream parameters  and
       then  returns  the  RTMP  data  in the HTTP response. The only valid HTTP
       request is &quot;GET /&quot; but additional options can be provided in  URL-encoded
       fashion.  Options specified on the command line will be used as defaults,
       which can be overridden by options in the HTTP request.

OPTIONS
   Network Parameters
       These options define how to connect to the media server.

       --rtmp         -r url
              URL of the server and media content.

       --host         -n hostname
              Overrides the hostname in the RTMP URL.

       --port         -c port
              Overrides the port number in the RTMP URL.

       --protocol     -l number
              Overrides the protocol in the RTMP URL.
                0 = rtmp
                1 = rtmpt
                2 = rtmpe
                3 = rtmpte
                4 = rtmps
                5 = rtmpts

       --socks        -S host:port
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy.

   Connection Parameters
       These options define the content of the RTMP Connect request packet.   If
       correct values are not provided, the media server will reject the connec&#8208;
       tion attempt.

       --app          -a app
              Name of application to connect to on the  RTMP  server.  Overrides
              the  app in the RTMP URL. Sometimes the rtmpdump URL parser cannot
              determine the app name automatically, so it must be given  explic&#8208;
              itly using this option.

       --tcUrl        -t url
              URL      of      the      target      stream.      Defaults     to
              rtmp[e]://host[:port]/app/playpath.

       --pageUrl      -p url
              URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
              value will be sent.

       --swfUrl       -s url
              URL  of  the SWF player for the media. By default no value will be
              sent.

       --flashVer     -f version
              Version of the Flash plugin  used  to  run  the  SWF  player.  The
              default is &quot;LNX 10,0,32,18&quot;.

       --auth         -u string
              An  authentication  string  to be appended to the Connect message.
              Using this option will append a Boolean TRUE and then  the  speci&#8208;
              fied  string.  This option is only used by some particular servers
              and is deprecated. The more general --conn option should  be  used
              instead.

       --conn         -C type:data
              Append arbitrary AMF data to the Connect message. The type must be
              B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z  for
              null.  For  Booleans  the  data must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or
              TRUE, respectively. Likewise for Objects the data must be 0  or  1
              to  end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects
              may be named, by prefixing the type with &apos;N&apos;  and  specifying  the
              name  before the value, e.g.  NB:myFlag:1. This option may be used
              multiple times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences. E.g.
                -C B:1 -C S:authMe -C O:1 -C NN:code:1.23 -C NS:flag:ok -C O:0

   Session Parameters
       These options take effect after the Connect request has succeeded.

       --playpath     -y path
              Overrides the playpath parsed from the  RTMP  URL.  Sometimes  the
              rtmpdump URL parser cannot determine the correct playpath automat&#8208;
              ically, so it must be given explicitly using this option.

       --live         -v
              Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
              live streams is possible.

       --subscribe    -d stream
              Name of live stream to subscribe to. Defaults to playpath.

       --start        -A num
              Start at num seconds into the stream. Not valid for live streams.

       --stop         -B num
              Stop at num seconds into the stream.

       --buffer       -b num
              Set buffer time to num milliseconds. The default is 20000.

       --timeout      -m num
              Timeout  the  session after num seconds without receiving any data
              from the server. The default is 120.

   Security Parameters
       These options handle additional authentication requests from the server.

       --token        -T key
              Key for SecureToken response, used if the server requires  Secure&#8208;
              Token authentication.

       --jtv          -j JSON
              JSON   token  used  by  legacy  Justin.tv  servers.  Invokes  Net&#8208;
              Stream.Authenticate.UsherToken

       --swfhash      -w hexstring
              SHA256 hash of the decompressed  SWF  file.  This  option  may  be
              needed  if  the server uses SWF Verification, but see the --swfVfy
              option below. The hash is 32 bytes, and must be given in hexadeci&#8208;
              mal. The --swfsize option must always be used with this option.

       --swfsize      -x num
              Size  of  the  decompressed SWF file. This option may be needed if
              the server uses SWF Verification,  but  see  the  --swfVfy  option
              below. The --swfhash option must always be used with this option.

       --swfVfy       -W url
              URL  of  the  SWF  player for this media. This option replaces all
              three of the --swfUrl, --swfhash, and --swfsize options. When this
              option is used, the SWF player is retrieved from the specified URL
              and the hash and size are computed automatically. Also the  infor&#8208;
              mation  is cached in a .swfinfo file in the user&apos;s home directory,
              so that it doesn&apos;t need to be  retrieved  and  recalculated  every
              time  rtmpdump is run. The .swfinfo file records the URL, the time
              it was fetched, the modification timestamp of the  SWF  file,  its
              size,  and  its hash. By default, the cached info will be used for
              30 days before re-checking.

       --swfAge       -X days
              Specify how many days to use the cached SWF info before  re-check&#8208;
              ing.  Use  0  to  always check the SWF URL. Note that if the check
              shows that the SWF file has the  same  modification  timestamp  as
              before, it will not be retrieved again.

   Miscellaneous
       --device       -D address
              Listener IP address. The default is 0.0.0.0, i.e., any IP address.

       --sport        -g port
              Listener port. The default is 80.

       --quiet        -q
              Suppress all command output.

       --verbose      -V
              Verbose command output.

       --debug        -z
              Debug  level output. Extremely verbose, including hex dumps of all
              packet data.

       --help         -h
              Print a summary of command options.

EXAMPLES
       The HTTP request
            GET /?r=rtmp:%2f%2fserver%2fmyapp&amp;y=somefile HTTP/1.0
       is equivalent to the rtrmpdump(1) invocation
            rtmpdump -r rtmp://server/myapp -y somefile

       Note that only the shortform (single letter) options are supported.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   The value of $HOME is used as the location for the .swfinfo file.

FILES
       $HOME/.swfinfo
              Cache of SWF Verification information
