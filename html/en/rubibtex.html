NAME
       rubibtex  - make a bibliography for (La)TeX using Russian letters as item
       names

SYNOPSIS
       rubibtex BASENAME

DESCRIPTION
       rubibtex is used to run bibtex(1) on auxiliary files with Russian charac&#8208;
       ters in item names (citation keys).  It is part of the T2 package.

       rubibtex copies the auxiliary file to /tmp, uses sed(1) to convert Cyril&#8208;
       lic character commands to their 8-bit ASCII equivalents;  runs  bibtex(1)
       on  the modified file; and finally moves the original auxiliary file back
       (overwriting the modified file).

       rubibtex assumes that the bibtex(1) database (bib) files are encoded with
       the KOI8-R encoding.

FILES
       basename.aux
              LaTeX auxiliary file
