NAME
       rumakeindex - process a LaTeX index using Russian Cyrillic characters

SYNOPSIS
       rumakeindex basename

DESCRIPTION
       rumakeindex  is  used  to  run makeindex(1) on idx files that use Russian
       characters.  It is part of the T2 package.

       rumakeindex runs sed(1) on the idx file  to  convert  Cyrillic  character
       commands  to  8-bit  ASCII  characters; pipes the results through makein&#8208;
       dex(1); and then through tr(1) to do some final conversions.  The results
       are placed in a KOI8-R encoded ind file.
