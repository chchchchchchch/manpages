RUN-WITH-ASPELL(1)      Aspell Abbreviated User&apos;s Manual      RUN-WITH-ASPELL(1)



NAME
       run-with-aspell - script to help use GNU Aspell as an ispell replacement

SYNOPSIS
       run-with-aspell &lt;command&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       The  recommended  way  to  use  Aspell  as a replacement for Ispell is to
       change the Ispell command from within the program being used.  If that is
       not possible, the run-with-aspell script may be used instead.

OPTIONS
       &lt;command&gt;
              is the name of the program with any optional arguments.

       The  old method of mapping ispell to Aspell is discouraged because it can
       create compatibility problems with programs that actually require  ispell
       such as ispell&apos;s own scripts.

SEE ALSO
       aspell(1), aspell-import(1), word-list-compress(1)

       Aspell is fully documented in its Texinfo manual.  See the `aspell&apos; entry
       in info for more complete documentation.
