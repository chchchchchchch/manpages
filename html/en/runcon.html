RUNCON(1)                         User Commands                        RUNCON(1)



NAME
       runcon - run command with specified security context

SYNOPSIS
       runcon CONTEXT COMMAND [args]
       runcon [ -c ] [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-t TYPE] [-l RANGE] COMMAND [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current or transi&#8208;
       tioned security context modified by one or more of LEVEL, ROLE, TYPE, and
       USER.

       If  none  of  -c,  -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first argument is
       used as the complete context.  Any additional arguments after COMMAND are
       interpreted as arguments to the command.

       Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are likely to successfully run.

       Run  a program in a different security context.  With neither CONTEXT nor
       COMMAND, print the current security context.
