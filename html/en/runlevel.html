RUNLEVEL(8)            Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual           RUNLEVEL(8)



NAME
       runlevel -- find the previous and current system runlevel.

SYNOPSIS
       runlevel [utmp]

DESCRIPTION
       Runlevel  reads  the system utmp file (typically /var/run/utmp) to locate
       the runlevel record, and then prints the previous and current system run&#8208;
       level on its standard output, separated by a single space. If there is no
       previous system runlevel, the letter N will be printed instead.

       If no utmp file exists, or if no runlevel record can be  found,  runlevel
       prints the word unknown and exits with an error.

       Runlevel  can  be used in rc scripts as a substitute for the System-V who
       -r command.  However, in newer versions of init(8)  this  information  is
       also available in the environment variables RUNLEVEL and PREVLEVEL.

OPTIONS
       utmp   The name of the utmp file to read.

SEE ALSO
       init(8), utmp(5)
