RUNSCRIPT(1)                                                        RUNSCRIPT(1)



NAME
       runscript - script interpreter for minicom

SYNOPSIS
       runscript scriptname [logfile [homedir]]

DESCRIPTION
       runscript  is  a simple script interpreter that can be called from within
       the minicom communications program to automate tasks like logging in to a
       Unix system or your favorite BBS.

INVOCATION
       The  program  expects  a  script  name  and optionally a filename and the
       user&apos;s home directory as arguments, and it expects that  it&apos;s  input  and
       output  are  connected to the &quot;remote end&quot;, the system you are connecting
       to. All messages from runscript meant for the local screen  are  directed
       to  the stderr output. All this is automatically taken care of if you run
       it from minicom.  The logfile and home directory parameters are only used
       to tell the log command the name of the logfile and where to write it. If
       the homedir is omitted, runscript uses the directory found in  the  $HOME
       environment  variable.  If also the logfile name is omitted, the log com&#8208;
       mands are ignored.

KEYWORDS
       Runscript recognizes the following commands:

            expect   send     goto     gosub    return   !
            exit     print    set      inc      dec      if
            timeout  verbose  sleep    break    call     log


OVERVIEW OF KEYWORDS
       send &lt;string&gt;
            &lt;string&gt; is sent to the modem. It is followed by a  &apos;\r&apos;.   &lt;string&gt;
            can be:
              - regular text, e.g. &apos;send hello&apos;
              - text enclosed in quotes, e.g. &apos;send &quot;hello world&quot;&apos;

            Within &lt;string&gt; the following sequences are recognized:
                \n - newline
                \r - carriage return
                \a - bell
                \b - backspace
                \c - don&apos;t send the default &apos;\r&apos;.
                \f - formfeed
                \^ - the ^ character
                \o - send character o (o is an octal number)

            Control  characters  can be used in the string with the ^ prefix (^A
            to ^Z, ^[, ^ ^], ^^ and ^_). If you need to send  the  ^  character,
            you must prefix it with the \ escape character.
            Also  $(environment_variable)  can  be  used,  for  example $(TERM).
            Minicom passes three special environment variables: $(LOGIN),  which
            is  the  username, $(PASS), which is the password, as defined in the
            proper entry of the dialing directory, and $(TERMLIN) which  is  the
            number  of  actual  terminal lines on your screen (that is, the sta&#8208;
            tusline excluded).

       print &lt;string&gt;
            Prints &lt;string&gt; to the local screen.  Default  followed  by  &apos;\r\n&apos;.
            See the description of &apos;send&apos; above.
&#12;       label:
            Declares a label (with the name &apos;label&apos;) to use with goto or gosub.

       goto &lt;label&gt;
            Jump to another place in the program.

       gosub &lt;label&gt;
            Jumps  to  another place in the program. When the statement &apos;return&apos;
            is encountered, control returns to the statement  after  the  gosub.
            Gosub&apos;s can be nested.

       return
            Return from a gosub.

       ! &lt;command&gt;
            Runs  a shell for you in which &apos;command&apos; is executed. On return, the
            variable &apos;$?&apos; is set to the exit status of this command, so you  can
            subsequently test it using &apos;if&apos;.

       exit [value]
            Exit from &quot;runscript&quot; with an optional exit status. (default 1)

       set &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;
            Sets  the  value of &lt;variable&gt; (which is a single letter a-z) to the
            value &lt;value&gt;. If &lt;variable&gt; does not exist,  it  will  be  created.
            &lt;value&gt; can be a integer value or another variable.

       inc &lt;variable&gt;
            Increments the value of &lt;variable&gt; by one.

       dec &lt;variable&gt;
            Decrements the value of &lt;variable&gt; by one.

       if &lt;value&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;statement&gt;
            Conditional  execution of &lt;statement&gt;. &lt;operator&gt; can be &lt;, &gt;, != or
            =.  Eg, &apos;if a &gt; 3 goto exitlabel&apos;.

       timeout &lt;value&gt;
            Sets the global timeout. By default, &apos;runscript&apos; will exit after 120
            seconds.  This  can be changed with this command. Warning: this com&#8208;
            mand acts differently within an &apos;expect&apos; statement, but  more  about
            that later.

       verbose &lt;on|off&gt;
            By  default,  this  is  &apos;on&apos;. That means that anything that is being
            read from the modem by &apos;runscript&apos;, gets echoed to the screen.  This
            is so that you can see what &apos;runscript&apos; is doing.

       sleep &lt;value&gt;
            Suspend execution for &lt;value&gt; seconds.

       expect
              expect {
                pattern  [statement]
                pattern  [statement]
                [timeout &lt;value&gt; [statement] ]
                ....
              }
            The  most  important  command  of all. Expect keeps reading from the
            input until it reads a pattern that matches  one  of  the  specified
            ones.   If  expect  encounters an optional statement after that pat&#8208;
            tern, it will execute it. Otherwise the default is to just break out
            of the expect. &apos;pattern&apos; is a string, just as in &apos;send&apos; (see above).
            Normally, expect will timeout in 60 seconds and just exit, but  this
            can be changed with the timeout command.
&#12;       break
            Break  out of an &apos;expect&apos; statement. This is normally only useful as
            argument to &apos;timeout&apos; within an expect, because the  default  action
            of timeout is to exit immediately.

       call &lt;scriptname&gt;
            Transfers  control  to another scriptfile. When that scriptfile fin&#8208;
            ishes without errors, the original script will continue.

       log &lt;text&gt;
            Write text to the logfile.

NOTES
       If you want to make your script to exit minicom (for example when you use
       minicom  to dial up your ISP, and then start a PPP or SLIP session from a
       script), try the command &quot;! killall -9 minicom&quot; as the last  script  com&#8208;
       mand.  The  -9 option should prevent minicom from hanging up the line and
       resetting the modem before exiting.
       Well, I don&apos;t think this is enough information to make you an experienced
       &apos;programmer&apos;  in &apos;runscript&apos;, but together with the examples it shouldn&apos;t
       be too hard to write some useful script files. Things will be  easier  if
       you  have  experience with BASIC.  The minicom source code comes together
       with two example scripts, scriptdemo and unixlogin. Especially  the  last
       one is a good base to build on for your own scripts.

BUGS
       Runscript should be built in to minicom.
