rzip(1)                                                                  rzip(1)



NAME
       rzip - a large-file compression program

SYNOPSIS
       rzip [OPTIONS] &lt;files...&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       rzip  is  a  file compression program designed to do particularly well on
       very large files containing long distance redundancy.

OPTIONS SUMMARY
       Here is a summary of the options to rzip.



       -0, --worst            fastest (worst) compression
       -6                     default compression level
       -9, --best             slowest (best) compression
       -d, --decompress       decompress
       -f, --force            force overwrite of any existing files
       -o, --output FILENAME  specify the output file name
       -k, --keep             keep existing files
       -L, --level LEVEL      set compression level
       -P, --progress         show compression progress
       -S, --suffix SUFFIX    specify compressed suffix (default &apos;.rz&apos;)
       -v, --verbose          increase verbosity
       -V, --version          show version




OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Print an options summary page

       -V --version
              Print the rzip version number

       -0 (or --worst) to -9 (or --best) --level
              Set the compression level from 0 to 9. The default is to use level
              6, which is a reasonable compromise between speed and compression.
              The compression level is also strongly related to how much  memory
              rzip  uses,  so  if you are running rzip on a machine with limited
              amounts of memory then you will probably want to choose a  smaller
              level.

       -d --decompress
              Decompress. If this option is not used then rzip looks at the name
              used to launch the program. If it  contains  the  string  &apos;runzip&apos;
              then the -d option is automatically set.

       -o --output
              Set  the output file name. If this option is not set then the out&#8208;
              put file name is chosen based on the input name  and  the  suffix.
              The  -o option cannot be used if more than one file name is speci&#8208;
              fied on the command line.

       -S --suffix
              Set the compression suffix. The default is &apos;.rz&apos;.

       -f --force
              If this option is not specified then rzip will not  overwrite  any
              existing  files.  If  you  set this option then rzip will silently
              overwrite any files as needed.

       -k --keep
              If this option is not specified then rzip will delete  the  source
              file  after  successful  compression  or  decompression. When this
              option is specified then the source files are not deleted.

       -P --progress
              If this option is specified then rzip  will  show  the  percentage
              progress while compressing.

INSTALLATION
       Just install rzip in your search path.

COMPRESSION ALGORITHM
       rzip  operates  in  two  stages.  The first stage finds and encodes large
       chunks of duplicated data over potentially very  long  distances  (up  to
       nearly  a gigabyte) in the input file. The second stage is to use a stan&#8208;
       dard compression algorithm (bzip2) to compress the output  of  the  first
       stage.

       The  key  difference  between rzip and other well known compression algo&#8208;
       rithms is its ability to take advantage of very long distance redundency.
       The well known deflate algorithm used in gzip uses a maximum history buf&#8208;
       fer of 32k. The block sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to  900k
       of  history.  The history buffer in rzip can be up to 900MB long, several
       orders of magnitude larger than gzip or bzip2.

       It is quite common these days to need to compress files that contain long
       distance redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home direc&#8208;
       tories several users might have copies of the same file, or of quite sim&#8208;
       ilar  files.  It is also common to have a single file that contains large
       duplicated chunks over long  distances,  such  as  pdf  files  containing
       repeated  copies  of  the  same image. Most compression programs won&apos;t be
       able to take advantage of this redundency, and thus might achieve a  much
       lower compression ratio than rzip can achieve.

HISTORY
       The  ideas behind rzip were first implemented in 1998 while I was working
       on rsync. That version was too slow to be practical, and was replaced  by
       this version in 2003.

BUGS
       Unlike most Unix compression programs, rzip cannot compress or decompress
       to or from standard input or standard output. This is due to  the  nature
       of the algorithm that rzip uses and cannot easily be fixed.
