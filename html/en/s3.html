DESCRIPTION
       s3  is  an Xorg driver for S3 based video cards. The driver provides full
       accelerated support for the following colour depths: 8, 15,  16  and  24.
       The overlay video (Xv) is supported in depths 16 and 24 for the Trio64V+,
       Trio64UV+, Trio64V2/DX and Trio64V2/GX chips.


CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section  only  covers  configuration details specific to this driver. All
       options names are case and white space insensitive  when  parsed  by  the
       server, for example, &quot;trio 32/64&quot; and &quot;Trio32/64&quot; are equivalent.


   Chip overriding
       The driver auto-detects the chipset and RAMDAC, but the following Chipset
       names may optionally be specified in the configuration file &quot;Device&quot; sec&#8208;
       tion, and will override the auto-detection:


           &quot;964-0&quot;, &quot;964-1&quot;  86C964 (rev.0 and rev.1)
&#12;           &quot;968&quot;             86C968

           &quot;Trio32/64&quot;       86C732/86C764

           &quot;Aurora64V+&quot;      86CM65

           &quot;Trio64UV+&quot;       86C767

           &quot;Trio64V2/DX/GX&quot;  86C775/86C785


       The  86C765  (Trio64V+)  is  Chipset  &quot;Trio32/64&quot; with ChipRev greater or
       equal 0x40.

       An overriding of RAMDAC auto-detection currently is not implemented.


   Colour depth
       For every supported colour depth the X server  automatically  selects  an
       appropriate  number  of bits per pixel (bpp) for framebuffer. The depth 8
       is represented by 8 bpp framebuffer (1 byte/pixel), the depths 15 and  16
       (respectively  5.5.5  and  5.6.5 pixel formats) are represented by the 16
       bpp framebuffer (2 bytes/pixel). Whenever the depth 24 is configured, the
       X  server by default uses the 32 bpp framebuffer (4 bytes/pixel), and the
       hardware is adjusted accordingly to the X.8.8.8 pixel format, where X  is
       the ignored upper byte.


       As  the second option for the depth 24, the X server can be configured to
       use 24 bpp framebuffer with the 8.8.8 pixel format (3 bytes/pixel), which
       is  supported by Trio64V+, Trio64UV+, Trio64V2/DX and Trio64V2/GX. If the
       video board has limited video RAM the 24 bpp framebuffer has an advantage
       over  32 bpp framebuffer as it requires less memory to store screen, and,
       therefore, more space will be available for a video frame  (see  &quot;Overlay
       video&quot;  section).   The  24 bpp framebuffer can be selected by X server&apos;s
       option -fbbpp 24 or by specifying DefaultFbBpp option in xorg.conf(5):

           Section &quot;Screen&quot;
             DefaultFbBpp 24
             DefaultDepth 24
             ...
           EndSection


       However, the 24 bpp framebuffer mode has the  hardware  limitations:  (i)
       the  2D  acceleration  doesn&apos;t  work  with  this mode (use the &quot;shadowFB&quot;
       option to speed up drawing routines in this case);  (ii)  24  bpp  frame&#8208;
       buffer  cannot  be  used  with  either  interlaced or doublescan graphics
       modes.


   Overlay video
       If your video board has limited RAM it would be useful  to  estimate  how
       large video frame might be placed in offscreen video memory. Suppose that
       the video board has 2 MB of RAM, and X server is  configured  to  display
       800x600 with the depth 24. By default the 32 bpp framebuffer will be cho&#8208;
       sen for this depth, so 800 x 600 x 4 =  1875  kB  will  be  reserved  for
       screen,  and  2 MB - 1875 kB = 173 kB will remain for the offscreen area.
       This is sufficient space, for example, for the VCD NTSC 352x240 frame. If
       you  need  to  upscale  video with a bigger frame, but it doesn&apos;t fit the
       offscreen area, the only way to do this is to lower either the resolution
       or  framebuffer&apos;s  depth  or both before the viewing, otherwise, you will
       get the allocation error and will not see the video. For example, with 24
       bpp  framebuffer  and the same resolution 800x600 the offscreen area will
       be about 640 kB - it&apos;s enough for the 640x480 frame. 800x600 with the  16
       bpp  framebuffer  gives  about 1110 kB of offscreen area - this allows to
       upscale up to 768x576 movies. Note, that all movie resolutions  in  exam&#8208;
       ples above are provided as a reference; the movies can have the different
       aspect ratios and non-standard dimensions. A total pixel  amount  is  the
       main consideration not the certain width and height.

       Due  to  hardware  limitation  the  overlay  video will not work with the
       interlaced/doublescan modes. Downscaling is not implemented in hardware.


   Configuration options
       The following display Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable the hardware cursor. Currently, hardware  cursor
              is  not  implemented,  so the option will be ignored. Default: off
              (software cursor).

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable acceleration. Very useful for determining  if  the  driver
              has  problems  with drawing and acceleration routines. This is the
              first option to try if your server runs but you see  graphic  cor&#8208;
              ruption  on the screen. Using it decreases performance, as it uses
              software emulation for drawing operations  the  video  driver  can
              accelerate with hardware. Default: off (acceleration is enabled).

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Use  shadow  framebuffer. Disables hardware acceleration. Use this
              option when the hardware acceleration is not available or undesir&#8208;
              able. Default: off.

       Option &quot;XVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable Xv support. Default: on.


       The following video memory Options are supported:

       Option &quot;slow_dram_refresh&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  three  refresh  cycles  per  scanline.  Default:  off (one
              refresh cycle).

       Option &quot;slow_edodram&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Switch to 2-cycle EDO mode. Try this if you encounter  pixel  cor&#8208;
              ruption.  Using  this option will cause a decrease in performance.
              Default: off (BIOS defaults).

       Option &quot;slow_dram&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              For Trio and Aurora64V+ chips: increase -RAS Precharge  Timing  to
              3.5  MCLK. Try this option if you encounter pixel errors. Default:
              off (BIOS defaults).

       Option &quot;slow_vram&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              For Vision964, Vision968 chips: increase -RAS Low  Timing  to  4.5
              MCLK. Default: off (BIOS defaults).
