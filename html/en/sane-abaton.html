sane-abaton(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-abaton(5)



NAME
       sane-abaton - SANE backend for Abaton flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-abaton library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to Abaton flatbed scanners. At present, only the
       Scan  300/GS  (8bit,  256  levels of gray) is fully supported, due to the
       absence of programming information.  The Scan 300/S (black and white)  is
       recognized, but support for it is untested.

       If  you  own a Abaton scanner other than the ones listed above that works
       with this backend, or if you own an Abaton scanner  that  does  not  work
       with this backend, please contact sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org with
       the model number, so that arrangements can be made to include support for
       it.  Have  a  look at http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html con&#8208;
       cerning subscription to sane-devel.

       Abaton is out of business, and these scanners are not supported by Everex
       (the  parent company of Abaton), nor is there any programming information
       to be found.  This driver is therefore based on information  obtained  by
       running  Abaton&apos;s  scanning  desk accessory under MacsBug and tracing the
       MacOS SCSI Manager calls it made during image acquisition.

       However, the protocol is very similar to, though not compatible with, the
       one  used  by  the  Apple  scanners,  therefore,  if this backend is ever
       extended to support the other Abaton  models  (they  also  made  a  color
       flatbed  scanner),  it  may  be possible to fill in some &quot;missing pieces&quot;
       from the (quite detailed) Apple scanner documentation.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that corresponds to
       a  SCSI  scanner.  For  SCSI  scanners, the special device name must be a
       generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux,  such  a
       device  name  takes  a  format such as /dev/sga or /dev/sg0, for example.
       See sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the abaton.conf file is a list of device names that  cor&#8208;
       respond  to  Abaton scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
       mark (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes  a
       valid device name.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/abaton.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-abaton.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-abaton.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_ABATON
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 255 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


BUGS
       There are a few known ones, and definitely some unknown ones.

       Scan area miscalculations
              For the sake of programmer efficiency, this  backend  handles  all
              measurements  in millimetres, and floors (rather than rounds) val&#8208;
              ues to avoid possible damage to the scanner mechanism.  Therefore,
              it  may  not  be  possible  to scan to the extreme right or bottom
              edges of the page.

       Cancelling the scan
              This might not work correctly, or it  might  abort  the  frontend.
              The former is more likely than the latter.

       If  you  have  found something that you think is a bug, please attempt to
       recreate it with the SANE_DEBUG_ABATON environment variable set  to  255,
       and  send  a  report  detailing  the  conditions  surrounding  the bug to
       sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.


TODO
       Implement non-blocking support

       Finish reverse-engineering the MacOS driver
              This will allow me to add support for other models with reasonable
              confidence  that  it  will  work,  as well as to fully exploit the
              information returned by the INQUIRY command.
