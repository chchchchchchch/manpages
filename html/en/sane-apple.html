sane-apple(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-apple(5)



NAME
       sane-apple - SANE backend for Apple flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-apple library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to Apple flatbed scanners. At present, the  fol&#8208;
       lowing scanners are supported from this backend:

       --------------- ----- ------------------ ------
       AppleScanner    4bit  16 Shades of Gray
       OneScanner      8bit  256 Shades of Gray
       ColorOneScanner 24bit RGB color          3-pass


       If  you  own  a Apple scanner other than the ones listed above that works
       with this backend, please let us know  by  sending  the  scanner&apos;s  model
       name,       SCSI       id,       and       firmware      revision      to
       sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.                                   See
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details on how to sub&#8208;
       scribe to sane-devel.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is either the path-name for the special device that  corre&#8208;
       sponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the special device name must
       be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such  a  device.   Under  Linux,
       such  a  device  name  could  be  /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example.  See
       sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The apple.conf file is a list of options and device names that correspond
       to  Apple  scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#)
       are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of  what  constitutes  a  valid
       device name.

       Options  come in two flavors: global and positional ones.  Global options
       apply to all devices managed by the backend, whereas  positional  options
       apply  just  to the most recently mentioned device.  Note that this means
       that the order in which the options appear matters!


SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
       SCSI scanners are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.  Unfortu&#8208;
       nately,  that adapter is not worth much since it is not interrupt driven.
       It is sometimes possible to get the supplied card to work, but without an
       interrupt  line,  scanning  will  put  so much load on the system that it
       becomes almost unusable for other tasks.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/apple.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-apple.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-apple.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable is list of directories where SANE  looks
              for  the configuration file.  Under UNIX directory names are sepa&#8208;
              rated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2  by  a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).   If
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR is not set, SANE defaults to searching the current
              working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then /etc/sane.d.   If  the  value  of
              $SANE_CONFIG_DIR  ends  with  the separator character, the default
              directories are searched after the directory list.   For  example,
              setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directo&#8208;
              ries &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in  that
              order).

       SANE_DEBUG_APPLE
              Controls the debug level.  A value of 255 prints all debug output.
              Smaller values reduce verbosity.  Requires a library compiled with
              debug support.


CURRENT STATUS
       The  apple  backend is now in version 0.3 (Tue Jul 21 1998). Since I only
       have the AppleScanner and not the other models (OneScanner, ColorOneScan&#8208;
       ner)  I  can only develop/test for the AppleScanner effectively.  However
       with this release I almost completed the gui part of all scanners.   Most
       of  the  functionality  is  there. At least OneScanner should scan at the
       AppleScanner&apos;s compatible modes (LineArt, HalfTone, Gray16). My  personal
       belief  is  that with a slight touch of debugging the OneScanner could be
       actually usable. The ColorOneScanner needs more work. AppleScanner is  of
       course almost fully supported.


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       Currently all three models lack upload/download support.

       AppleScanner
              Cannot up/download a halftone pattern.

       OneScanner
              Cannot up/download halftone patterns or calibration vectors.

       ColorOneScanner
              Cannot  up/download halftone patterns, calibration vectors, custom
              Color Correction Tables (CCT) and of course custom gamma tables.

       Park/UnPark (OneScanner, ColorOneScanner)

       The above functionalities are missing because I don&apos;t have  the  hardware
       to  experiment  on.  Another reason is my lack of understanding as to how
       or if the SANE API provide means  to  describe  any  array  type  besides
       gamma.



UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
       The  following &quot;features&quot; will never be supported, at least while I main&#8208;
       tain the sane-apple backend.

       NoHome (AppleScanner)
              The scanner lamp stays on and the carriage assembly remains  where
              it stops at the end of the scan. After two minutes, if the scanner
              does not receive another SCAN command, the lamp goes off  and  the
              carriage returns to the home position.

       Compression (AppleScanner)
              The Scanner can compress data with CCITT Group III one dimensional
              algorithm (fax) and the Skip White Line algorithm.

       Multiple Windows (AppleScanner)
              AppleScanner may support multiple windows. It would be a cool fea&#8208;
              ture and a challenge for me to code if it could intermix different
              options for different windows (scan areas). This way it could scan
              a  document in LineArt mode but the figures in it in Gray and at a
              different resolution.  Unfortunately this is impossible.

       Scan Direction (OneScanner)
              It controls the scan direction. (?)

       Status/Reset Button (OneScanner)
              This option controls the status of the button  on  the  OneScanner
              model. You can also reset the button status by software.


BUGS
       SANE  backend bugs are divided in two classes. We have GUI bugs and scan&#8208;
       ner specific bugs.

       We know we have a GUI bug when a parameter is  not  showing  up  when  it
       should  (active)  or  vice versa. Finding out which parameters are active
       across  various  Apple  modes   and   models   from   the   documentation
       ftp://ftpdev.info.apple.com/devworld/Technical_Documentation/Peripher&#8208;
       als_Documentation/ is an interesting exercise. I  may  have  missed  some
       dependencies.  For  example of the threshold parameter the Apple Scanners
       Programming Guide says nothing. I had to assume it is valid only in  Lin&#8208;
       eArt mode.

       Scanner  specific bugs are mostly due to mandatory round-offs in order to
       scan. In the documentation in one place states that the width of the scan
       area  should  be a byte multiple. In another place it says that the width
       of the scan area should be an even byte multiple. Go figure...

       Other sources of bugs are due to scsi communication,  scsi  connects  and
       disconnects.  However  the  classical  bugs  are  still there. So you may
       encounter buffer overruns, null pointers, memory corruption and SANE  API
       violations.

       SIGSEGV on SliceBars
              When you try to modify the scan area from the slice bar you have a
              nice little cute core dump. I don&apos;t know why. If  you  select  the
              scan  area  from  the preview window or by hand typing the numbers
              everything is fine. The SIGSEGV happens deep in gtk library (gdk).
              I really cannot debug it.

       Options too much
              It  is possible, especially for the ColorOneScanner, for the back&#8208;
              end&apos;s options panel to extend beyond your screen. It happens  with
              mine and I am running my X Server at 1024x768. What can I say? Try
              smaller fonts in the X server, or virtual screens.

       Weird SCSI behaviour
              I am quoting David Myers Here...

              &gt;&gt; OS: FreeBSD 2.2.6
              &gt;&gt; CC: egcs-1.02
              Just wanted to follow up on this...  I recently  changed  my  SCSI
              card  from  the  Adaptec  2940UW  to  a  dual-channel  Symbios 786
              chipset.  When I started up SANE with your driver,  I  managed  to
              scan  line  art drawings okay, but Gray16 scans led to a stream of
              SCSI error messages on the console, ultimately hanging with a mes&#8208;
              sage  saying  the scanner wasn&apos;t releasing the SCSI bus.  This may
              be that the Symbios is simply less tolerant of  ancient  hardware,
              or may be bugs in your driver or in SANE itself...
&#12;DEBUG
       If  you  encounter  a  GUI  bug  please  set  the  environmental variable
       SANE_DEBUG_APPLE to 255 and rerun the exact sequence  of  keystrokes  and
       menu  selections  to  reproduce  it.  Then  send me a report with the log
       attached.

       If you have an Apple Macintosh with the AppleScanners  driver  installed,
       reporting  to  me  which  options are grayed out (inactive) in what modes
       would be very helpful.

       If you want to offer some help but you don&apos;t have a scanner, or you don&apos;t
       have  the  model you would like to help with, or you are a SANE developer
       and you just want to take a look at how the  apple  backend  looks  like,
       goto  to apple.h and #define the NEUTRALIZE_BACKEND macro. You can select
       the scanner model through the APPLE_MODEL_SELECT macro. Available options
       are APPLESCANNER, ONESCANNER, COLORONESCANNER.

       If  you  encounter  a  SCSI  bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images
       please set the environment variable SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to  255  before
       sending me the report.


TODO
       Non Blocking Support
              Make   sane-apple   a   non  blocking  backend.  Properly  support
              sane_set_io_mode and sane_get_select_fd

       Scan   Make scanning possible for all models in all supported modes.

       Missing Functionality

AUTHOR
       The sane-apple backend was written not entirely  from  scratch  by  Milon
       Firikis.  It  is  mostly based on the mustek backend from David Mosberger
       and Andreas Czechanowski
