sane-artec(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-artec(5)



NAME
       sane-artec - SANE backend for Artec flatbed scanners


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-artec library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access  to  Artec/Ultima  SCSI  flatbed  scanners.   At
       present, the following scanners are known to work at least partially with
       this backend:

              * Artec A6000C
              * Artec A6000C PLUS
              * Artec ViewStation AT3
              * BlackWidow BW4800SP (rebadged Artec AT3)
              * Artec ViewStation AT6
              * Artec ViewStation AT12
              * Artec AM12S
              * Plustek 19200S (rebadged Artec AM12S)

       Although this manual page is generally updated with each release,  up-to-
       date  information on new releases and extraneous helpful hints are avail&#8208;
       able from the backend homepage:

DOCUMENTATION
CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the artec.conf file are a list of device names that  cor&#8208;
       respond  to  Artec  scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
       mark (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes  a
       valid device name.

       Sample file:
       # artec.conf
       #
       # this is a comment.
       #
       # this line says search for any SCSI devices which are scanners and have
       #     a vendor string of &apos;ULTIMA&apos;
       scsi ULTIMA
       #
       # the next line forces the backend to assume the next scanner found has
       #     the specified vendor string (useful for testing rebadged models).
       vendor ULTIMA
       #
       # the next line forces the backend to assume the next scanner found has
       #     the specified model string (useful for testing rebadged models).
       model AT3
       #
       # now a line that actually specifies a device.  The backend is going to
       #     assume this is an Artec/Ultima AT3 because we forced the vendor and
       #     model above.
       /dev/scanner
       #
       # once we hit a scanner device line, the forced vendor and model
       # string are
       #     &apos;forgotten&apos;, so the vendor and model for this next device will be
       #     determined from the result of a SCSI inquiry.
       /dev/sge
       #
&#12;SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
       Some  Artec scanners come with an included SCSI adapter.  If your scanner
       came with a DTC ISA scsi cards, you can probably use it with  recent  (&gt;=
       2.2.0) kernels using the generic NCR5380 support.  You must pass the fol&#8208;
       lowing boot argument to the kernel: &quot;dtc3181e=0x2c0,0&quot;
       I do not have any information on the PCI SCSI adapter included with  some
       newer Artec scanners.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/artec.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-artec.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-artec.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi- colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working direc- tory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity: SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC values

              Number  Remark

               4       print scanner-inquiry
               5       print informations
               6       print less important informations
               7       print major called procedures
               8       print all called procedures
               9       print procedure info/data messages
               10      print called sane-init-routines
               11      print called sane-procedures
               12      print sane infos
               13      print sane option-control messages

               50      print verbose data/debug messages

               == 100  print software RGB calibration data
               == 101  print raw data from scanner to artec.data.raw file

               == 128  print out all messages

       Example: export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC=13


BUGS
       Known bugs in this release: A6000C+ users with firmware v1.92 or  earlier
       have problems with the backend, the cause has not been determined.  Some&#8208;
       times the backend is not particularly robust, you can  possibly  lock  up
       the  SCSI  bus  (and/or machine) by not having patience enough when scan&#8208;
       ning.  3-channel gamma correction is not implemented  and  single-channel
       gamma correction is not totally working on models other than the AT3.
