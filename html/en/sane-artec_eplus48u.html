sane-artec_eplus48u(5)                SANE                sane-artec_eplus48u(5)



NAME
       sane-artec_eplus48u  -  SANE backend for the scanner Artec E+ 48U and re-
       badged models

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-artec_eplus48u library implements a  SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now
       Easy)  backend that provides access to several USB flatbed scanners using
       the GT6816 chipset like the Artec E+ 48U.  These scanners have a  contact
       image sensor (CIS) and an USB interface.

       A    complete    list    of   supported   devices   can   be   found   on
       http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.

       This is ALPHA software. Especially if you test new or untested  scanners,
       keep  your hand at the scanner&apos;s plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at
       the end of the scan area.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones mentioned on the list that works
       with this backend, please let us know this by sending the scanner&apos;s exact
       model  name  and  the   USB   vendor   and   product   ids   (e.g.   from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  sane-find-scanner  or  syslog) to me. Even if the
       scanner&apos;s name is only  slightly  different  from  the  models  mentioned
       above, please let me know.

KERNEL ISSUES
       If  libusb-0.1.6  or later is installed, this section can be skipped. The
       scanner should be found by sane-find-scanner without further actions. For
       setting permissions and general USB information look at sane-usb(5).

       When  you are using the scanner module, a Linux kernel 2.4.12 or newer is
       required.


FIRMWARE FILE
       You need a firmware file for your scanner. That&apos;s a small file containing
       software  that will be uploaded to the scanner&apos;s memory. For the scanners
       mentioned above, it&apos;s usually named Artec48.usb or 1200.usb. You can find
       it on the installation CD that was provided by the manufacturer, normally
       in the directory Win98,  WinMe  or  similar.  If  the  Windows-driver  is
       installed  on  your  computer,  then  you can also find the firmware file
       under c:\windows\system32\drivers.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the artec_eplus48u.conf file is a list of usb lines  con&#8208;
       taining  vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file
       can also contain option lines.  Empty lines and  lines  starting  with  a
       hash  mark  (#)  are  ignored.  The scanners are autodetected by usb ven&#8208;
       dor_id  product_id   statements   which   are   already   included   into
       artec_eplus48u.conf  .  &quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal num&#8208;
       bers that identify the scanner.

       Every usb section can have additional options

       artecFirmwareFile /usr/share/sane/artec_eplus48u/Artec48.usb
              The path to the firmware file. This option is required.

       redGamma 1.0

       greenGamma 1.0

       blueGamma 1.0

       masterGamma 1.9
              These are the default gamma values.  If  you  set  the  &quot;Defaults&quot;
              option  with  a  frontend, then the gamma options are reset to the
              values specified here.

       redOffset 0x28

       greenOffset 0x2f

       blueOffset 0x2f

       redExposure 0xa7

       greenExposure 0x116

       blueExposure 0xdc
              These are the default values for offset and exposure time. You can
              e.g.  change  them  to  speed up calibration, if you don&apos;t want to
              save the calibration data to disk.

       vendorString Artec

       modelString E+ 48U
              By default, the scanner is reported as  &quot;Artec  E+  48U&quot;.  If  you
              don&apos;t  like  this,  e.g.  because you have an Tevion MD 9693, then
              change the options accordingly.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d/artec_eplus48u.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with  the  directory
              separator  character,  then  the  default directories are searched
              after the explicitly specified directories.  For example,  setting
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would  result  in directories
              &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/usr/local/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched  (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U=3

AUTHOR
       Michael Herder
       This  backend  is  based  on  the  gt68xx  test-program written by Sergey
       Vlasov, Andreas Nowack, and  David  Stevenson.  Thanks  to  everyone  who
       tested the backend or reported bugs.
       This  man  page  is  based  on man sane-gt68xx, written by Henning Meier-
       Geinitz.

BUGS
       This backend has been tested on Linux only. If you are using it on a dif&#8208;
       ferent platform, please contact us.

       Interpolation with 1200 dpi is weak.

       Support for buttons is missing due to missing support in SANE.

       Please       contact       us      if      you      find      a      bug:
