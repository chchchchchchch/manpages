sane-avision(5)           SANE Scanner Access Now Easy           sane-avision(5)



NAME
       sane-avision - SANE backend for original Avision and Avision OEM scanners
       (HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi, UMAX and possibly more) flatbed and film  scan&#8208;
       ners.


ABOUT THIS FILE
       This  file  is  a  short  descripton for the avision-backend shipped with
       SANE.


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-avision library implements a  SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend  that provides access to various Avision scanners and the Avision
       OEM scanners labelled by HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi or Fujitsu.

       It is fully big-endian aware and in every-day use on  PowerPC  and  SPARC
       systems.

       I  suggest you hold one hand on the power-button of the scanner while you
       try the first scans - especially with film-scanners!


CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file  for  this  backend  resides  in  /etc/sane.d/avi&#8208;
       sion.conf.

       Its  contents  is  a  list of device names that correspond to Avision and
       Avision compatible scanners and backend-options. Empty  lines  and  lines
       starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is
       shown below:

        # this is a comment

        option force-a4
        option force-a3
        option disable-gamma-table
        option disable-calibration

        #scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN
        scsi AVISION
        scsi HP
        scsi /dev/scanner
        usb 0x03f0 0x0701


       force-a4:
              Forces the backend to overwrite the scanable area returned by  the
              scanner to ISO A4. Scanner that are known to return bogus data are
              marked in the backend so if you need  this  option  please  report
              this to the backend maintainer. USE WITH CARE!

       force-a3:
              Forces  the backend to overwrite the scanable area returned by the
              scanner to ISO A3. Scanner that are known to return bogus data are
              marked  in  the  backend  so if you need this option please report
              this to the backend maintainer. USE WITH CARE!

       disable-gamma-table:
              Disables the usage of the scanner&apos;s  gamma-table.  You  might  try
              this if your scans hang or only produces random garbage.
&#12;       disable-calibration:
              Disables  the  scanner&apos;s  color calibration. You might try this if
              your scans hang or only produces random garbage.

       Note:  Any option above modifies the default code-flow for your  scanner.
              The  options  should only be used when you encounter problems with
              the default be- haviour of the backend. Please report the need  of
              options  to the backend-author so the backend can be fixed as soon
              as possible.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              scsi scsi-spec

              usb usb-spec

       Where scsi-spec is the path-name to a special device or a device  ID  for
       the  device  that  corresponds to a SCSI scanner. The special device name
       must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device, for  example
       on  Linux  &quot;/dev/sga&quot;  or &quot;/dev/sg0&quot;. The device ID is the ID returned by
       the scanner, for example &quot;HP&quot; or &quot;AVISION&quot;. See sane-scsi(5) for details.

       Note:  Since the backend now includes native USB access, it is no  longer
              needed  - even considered obsolete - to access USB scanner via the
              SCSI emulation (named hpusbscsi on Linux) for Avision USB  devices
              such as the HP 53xx, HP 74xx or Minolta film-scanners.

       usb-spec  is  the USB device name, the vendor/product ID pair or the name
       used by libusb corresponding to the  USB  scanner.  For  example  &quot;0x03f0
       0x0701&quot; or &quot;libusb:002:003&quot;. See sane-usb(5) for details.

       The  program  sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct scsi or usb
       device name.

       A list with supported devices is built into the avision backend  so  nor&#8208;
       mally specifying an ID should not be necessary.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/avision.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-avision.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-avision.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_AVISION
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher  debug  levels  increase  the  verbosity of the output. The
              debug level 7 is the author&apos;s  prefered  value  to  debug  backend
              problems.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_AVISION=7
