sane-canon630u(5)         SANE Scanner Access Now Easy         sane-canon630u(5)



NAME
       sane-canon630u - SANE backend for the Canon 630u USB flatbed scanner

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-canon630u  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following Canon flatbed scanners:

              CanoScan 630u
              CanoScan 636u

       Color scanning is supported at 75, 150, 300, and 600 dpi, and  gamma  and
       analog gain are adjustable.

       TESTERS  ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments to Nathan Rutman
       &lt;nthn1@yahoo.com&gt;

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the canon630u.conf file is a list of  device  names  that
       correspond  to Canon USB scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.   Only  one  device  name  can  be  listed  in
       canon630u.conf.  The program sane-find-scanner helps to find out the cor&#8208;
       rect device. Under Linux, such a device name could  be  /dev/usb/scanner0
       for example.  See sane-usb(5) for details.

       This  product-specific  scanner  driver  uses  the lower-level kernel USB
       driver    &quot;scanner&quot;.      Check     for     &quot;Driver=usbscanner&quot;     under
       /proc/bus/usb/devices.   If  &quot;Driver=(none)&quot;, try forcing it with &quot;insmod
       scanner vendor=0x04a9 product=0x2204&quot;

NOTES
       Due to Canon&apos;s unwillingness to provide scanner documentation, this soft&#8208;
       ware  was  developed  by  analyzing  the  USB traffic of the Windows 2000
       driver.  So things like the calibration procedure I kind of made  up;  it
       seems to work for my scanner.  If you have complaints, let me know.

       This  driver requires the ability to send USB Control Messages, available
       in kernel 2.4.12 or later.

       Some users have reported that this driver  doesn&apos;t  work  at  all.   This
       seems to be a hardware specific issue, although I don&apos;t know what exactly
       the problem is.  If you are having problems, please send me the  info  in
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  /proc/pci,  the  kernel  scanner.c driver version
       from /var/log/messages,  and  the  output  from  &quot;SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12
       scanimage &gt; /dev/null&quot;

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/canon630u.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-canon630u.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-canon630u.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

       /tmp/canon.cal
              The  calibration file used to normalize pixel brightness.  This is
              calculated every time the scanner is first used after it has  lost
              power.  Deleting this file will force recalibration.
&#12;ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example:
              SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt; /dev/null
