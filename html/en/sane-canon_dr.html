sane-canon_dr(5)          SANE Scanner Access Now Easy          sane-canon_dr(5)



NAME
       sane-canon_dr - SANE backend for Canon DR-series scanners


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-canon_dr  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend which provides access to some Canon DR-series scanners.

       This document describes backend  version  37,  which  shipped  with  SANE
       1.0.22.


SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This  version  has only been tested with a few scanner models. Please see
       http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html  for   the   most
       recent list.

       This  backend may support other Canon scanners. The best way to determine
       level of support is to test the scanner directly, or to collect  a  trace
       of  the  windows driver in action.  Please contact the author for help or
       with test results.

       In general, the larger machines (DR-4000 and up) which have  been  tested
       use  a  fairly  complete  protocol, with hardware support for many modes,
       resolutions and features. The smaller  machines  have  many  limitations,
       like missing horizontal resolutions, missing binary mode, always scanning
       full-width, etc.  There is code in the backend to address these problems,
       but there seems to be no way to detect if they are required, so they must
       be hard-coded.


OPTIONS
       Effort has been made to expose most hardware options, including:

       source s
              Selects the source for the scan. Options  may  include  &quot;Flatbed&quot;,
              &quot;ADF Front&quot;, &quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.

       mode m
              Selects  the  mode  for  the  scan. Options may include &quot;Lineart&quot;,
              &quot;Halftone&quot;, &quot;Gray&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot;.

       resolution
              Controls scan resolution.

       tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y
              Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates.  These  are
              renamed t, l, x, y by some frontends.

       page-width, page-height
              Sets  paper  size.  Used by scanner to determine centering of scan
              coordinates when using ADF and to detect double feed errors.

       Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner:
       enhancement, compression, buttons and sensors, etc.

       Additionally,  several  &apos;software&apos;  options  are  exposed by the backend.
       These are reimplementations of features provided natively by larger scan&#8208;
       ners,  but running on the host computer. This enables smaller machines to
       have similar capabilites. Please note that these  features  are  somewhat
       simplistic,  and  may  not perform as well as the native implementations.
       Note also that these features all  require  that  the  driver  cache  the
       entire  image in memory. This will almost certainly result in a reduction
       of scanning speed.

       swcrop
              Requests the driver to detect the extremities of the paper  within
              the larger image, and crop the empty edges.

       swdeskew
              Requests the driver to detect the rotation of the paper within the
              larger image, and counter the rotation.

       swdespeck X
              Requests the driver to find and  remove  dots  of  X  diameter  or
              smaller  from  the image, and fill the space with the average sur&#8208;
              rounding color.

       Use &apos;scanimage --help&apos; to get a list, but be aware that some options  may
       be  settable  only  when  another  option has been set, and that advanced
       options may be hidden by some frontend programs.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file &quot;canon_dr.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
       look  for  scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the
       backend.  This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for a
       list of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the config&#8208;
       uration file is missing, the backend will fail to run.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4 ways:

       &quot;scsi CANON DR&quot;
              Requests backend to search all scsi busses in  the  system  for  a
              device  which reports itself to be a scanner made by &apos;CANON&apos;, with
              a model name starting with &apos;DR&apos;.

       &quot;scsi /dev/sg0&quot; (or other scsi device file)
              Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful if you
              have  multiple  compatible  scanners connected to your system, and
              need to specify one. Probably should not be used  with  the  other
              &quot;scsi&quot; line above.

       &quot;usb 0x04a9 0x1603&quot; (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests  backend  to  search  all  usb busses in the system for a
              device which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then
              be queried to determine if it is a Canon scanner.

       &quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
              Some  systems  use  a  kernel  driver to access usb scanners. This
              method is untested.

       Besides the &apos;scsi&apos; and &apos;usb&apos; lines, the configuration file  supports  the
       following &apos;option&apos; lines:

       &quot;option buffer-size [number of bytes]&quot;
              Set the number of bytes in the data buffer to something other than
              the compiled-in default of 4MB. Large values may cause timeouts or
              hangs, small values may cause slow scans.

              Note:  The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as
              some users required it to be quite large. Values above the default
              are  not  recommended,  and  may crash your OS or lockup your scsi
              card driver. You have been warned.

       &quot;option vendor-name [string of text]&quot;
       &quot;option model-name [string of text]&quot;
       &quot;option version-name [string of text]&quot;
              These options can be used collectively to override the values pro&#8208;
              vided  by  the  scanner, or to provide the values when the scanner
              cannot.

       &quot;option padded-read [0|1]&quot;
              Some scanners prepend all data transmitted to host with 12  bytes.
              Enable this option if the scanner fails to respond to commands.

       Note: &apos;option&apos; lines may appear multiple times in the configuration file.
       They only apply to scanners discovered by the next &apos;scsi/usb&apos; line.

ENVIRONMENT
       The backend uses  a  single  environment  variable,  SANE_DEBUG_CANON_DR,
       which enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 SCSI/USB trace
              30 SCSI/USB detail
              35 Useless noise


KNOWN ISSUES
       This  backend was entirely reverse engineered from usb traces of the pro&#8208;
       prietary driver. Various advanced features of the  machines  may  not  be
       enabled. Many machines have not been tested. Their protocol is unknown.
