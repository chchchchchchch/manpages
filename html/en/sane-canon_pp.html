NAME
       sane-canon_pp  -  SANE  backend  for Canon CanoScan Parallel Port flatbed
       scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-canon_pp library implements a SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following Canon flatbed scanners:

              CanoScan FB320P
              CanoScan FB620P
              CanoScan FB330P
              CanoScan FB630P
              CanoScan N340P
              CanoScan N640P
              CanoScan N640P ex

       No  USB  scanners are supported and there are no plans to support them in
       the future.  Other projects are working on support for USB scanners.  See
       the  PROJECTS  file for more detail.  The FB310P and FB610P are re-badged
       Avision scanners which use a different command set, so are unlikely to be
       supported by this backend in the future.

       IMPORTANT: this is alpha code. While we have made every effort to make it
       as reliable as possible, it will not always work as  expected.   Feedback
       is  still appreciated.  Please send any bug reports to the maintainers as
       listed on the web page (listed in SEE ALSO below).

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form presented  by  libieee1284.
       These names are highly dependent on operating system and version.

       On  Linux 2.4 kernels this will be of the form parport0 or older (2.2 and
       before) kernels may produce names like 0x378 (the base  address  of  your
       port) or simply 0 depending on your module configuration.  Check the con&#8208;
       tents of /proc/parport if it exists.  If you  don&apos;t  want  to  specify  a
       default  port  (or  don&apos;t  know  its name), the backend should be able to
       detect which port your scanner is on.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the canon_pp.conf file is  a  list  of  options  for  the
       driver  to  use.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
       ignored.

       The supported options are currently ieee1284, calibrate,  init_mode,  and
       force_nibble

       Option ieee1284 port-name defines which port to use.  The format of port-
       name is OS dependent,  based  on  the  names  presented  by  libieee1284.
       Please only have one of these lines, or all but one will be ignored.

       Option  calibrate  cal-file [port-name] defines which calibration file to
       use on a per-port basis.  If you only have  one  parport,  the  port-name
       argument  may  be omitted - but be careful as this will cause problems on
       multi-scanner systems.  You may have as many of these lines as you  like,
       as  long  as  each  has a unique port name.  The tilde (`~&apos;) character is
       acceptable and will be expanded to the value of the HOME environment.

       Option init_mode &lt;AUTO|FB620P|FB630P&gt; [portname] defines which  initiali&#8208;
       sation  (wake-up)  mode to use on a per-port basis.  If you only have one
       parport, the portname argument may be omitted - but be  careful  as  this
       may  cause  problems  on  multi-scanner systems.  You may have as many of
       these lines as you like, as long as each has a  unique  port  name.   The
       valid  initialisation  modes  are  FB620P  (which  strobes  10101010  and
       01010101 on the data pins), FB630P (which strobes 11001100  and  00110011
       on  the data pins) and AUTO, which will try FB630P mode first then FB620P
       mode second.  The FB620P mode is also used by  the  FB320P.   The  FB630P
       mode is used by the FB330P, N340P, and N640P.

       Option force_nibble forces the driver to use nibble mode even if ECP mode
       is reported to work by libieee1284.  This works-around the rare issue  of
       ECP mode being reported to work by the library, then not working.


TIPS
       Hit the &quot;Calibrate&quot; button before scanning.  It vastly improves the qual&#8208;
       ity of scans.

       To enable automatic detection of your scanner, uncomment  the  &quot;canon_pp&quot;
       line from /etc/sane.d/dll.conf

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/canon_pp.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-canon_pp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-canon_pp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP=4

NOTES
       Features available in the Windows interface

       Brightness and Contrast
              These  are  not  implemented,  and  probably never will be.  These
              appear to be implemented entirely in software.  Use GIMP or a sim&#8208;
              ilar program if you need these features.

       Descreen Mode
              This appears on our first analysis to be just oversampling with an
              anti-aliasing filter.  Again, it seems to be implemented  entirely
              in software, so GIMP is your best bet for now.

       Gamma Tables
              This  is under investigation, but for now only a simple gamma pro&#8208;
              file (ie: the one returned during calibration) will be loaded.

       Communication Problems

       ECP mode in libieee1284 doesn&apos;t always work properly, even with new hard&#8208;
       ware.   We  believe that this is a ppdev problem.  If you change the con&#8208;
       figuration file to include force_nibble , the problem will go  away,  but
       you will only be able to scan in nibble mode.

       Sometimes the scanner can be left in a state where our code cannot revive
       it.  If the backend reports no scanner present, try unplugging the  power
       and  plugging  it  back  in.  Also try unplugging printers from the pass-
       through port.

       The scanner will not respond correctly to our  commands  when  you  first
       plug  in the power.  You may find if you try a scan very soon after plug&#8208;
       ging in the power that the backend will incorrectly report that you  have
       no  scanner  present.   To  avoid this, give it about 10 seconds to reset
       itself before attempting any scans.

       Repeated Lines

       Sometimes at high resolutions (ie. 600dpi) you will  notice  lines  which
       appear  twice.   These  lines correspond to points where the scanner head
       has stopped during the scan (it stops every time the internal 64kb buffer
       is  full).   Basically it&apos;s a mechanical problem inside the scanner, that
       the tolerance of movement for a start/stop event is  greater  than  1/600
       inches.   I&apos;ve never tried the windows driver so I&apos;m not sure how (or if)
       it works around this problem, but as we don&apos;t  know  how  to  rewind  the
       scanner  head  to  do  these bits again, there&apos;s currently no nice way to
       deal with the problem.

       Grey-scale Scans

       Be aware that the scanner uses the green LEDs to read  grey-scale  scans,
       meaning  green  coloured  things will appear lighter than normal, and red
       and blue coloured items will appear darker than normal.   For  high-accu&#8208;
       racy  grey-scale  scans of colour items, it&apos;s best just to scan in colour
       and convert to grey-scale in graphics software such as the GIMP.

       FB620P/FB320P Caveats

       These models can not be reset in the same way as the others.  The windows
       driver  doesn&apos;t  know how to reset them either - when left with an incon&#8208;
       sistent scanner, it will start scanning half way down the page!

       Aborting is known to work correctly on the FB*30P models, and is known to
       be  broken  on  the  FB*20P  models.  The FB620P which I tested on simply
       returns garbage after a scan has been aborted using the method  we  know.
       Aborting  is  able  to  leave the scanner in a state where it can be shut
       down, but not where another scan can be made.
