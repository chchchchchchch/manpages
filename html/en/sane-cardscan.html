NAME
       sane-cardscan - SANE backend for Corex CardScan usb scanners


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-cardscan  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend which provides access to the Corex CardScan 800c  &amp;  600c  small-
       format scanners.

       The  backend  supports only grayscale and color modes and media of (theo&#8208;
       retically) infinite length.

       This backend may support other scanners. The best way to determine  level
       of support is to get a trace of the windows driver in action, and send it
       to the author.


OPTIONS
       The cardscan backend supports the following options:

       mode m
              Selects the mode for the scan. Options are &quot;Gray&quot; and &quot;Color&quot;.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file &quot;cardscan.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
       look  for  scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the
       backend.  This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for a
       list of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the config&#8208;
       uration file is missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults,
       which are identical to the default configuration file shipped with SANE.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2 ways:

       &quot;usb 0x04c5 0x1042&quot; (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests  backend  to  search  all  usb busses in the system for a
              device which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then
              be queried to determine if it is a cardscan scanner.

       &quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
              Some  systems  use  a  kernel  driver to access usb scanners. This
              method is untested.

       Additionally, there are two configuration options that control the proto&#8208;
       col used by the backend:


       &quot;lines_per_block 16&quot; (or other number from 1 to 32)
              Controls  the  number of lines of image data which will be aquired
              in each pass.  Older scanners will require this number set  lower,
              often 1.

       &quot;has_cal_buffer 1&quot; (1 or 0)
              Causes  the  backend  to  get calibration data from scanner during
              initialization.  Older scanners do not support this  request,  and
              must be set to 0.


ENVIRONMENT
       The  backend  uses  a  single  environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_CARDSCAN,
       which enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 SCSI/USB trace
              30 SCSI/USB detail
              35 Useless noise


KNOWN ISSUES
              The scanner does not seem to have much control  possible,  so  the
              backend  cannot set x/y coordinate values, resolutions, etc. These
              things could be simulated in the backend, but there are plenty  of
              command line tools.
              The  backend  also does not send all the commands that the windows
              driver does, so it may not function the same.
              The backend does not have the calibration or ejection  options  of
              the windows driver.
