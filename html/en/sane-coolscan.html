NAME
       sane-coolscan - SANE backend for Nikon film-scanners


ABOUT THIS FILE
       This file is a short description of the coolscan-backend for sane!


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-coolscan  library  implements  a SANE backend that provides the
       interface to the following Nikon  Coolscan  Film  scanners:  Nikon  LS20,
       LS30, LS1000, LS2000.

       Even  though  the  backend  has  worked for a number of people, there are
       still some problems, especially in combination with some SCSI  card/driv&#8208;
       ers  (AHA-1505/aha152x.o)  and the autofocus command. You should consider
       this backend &apos;alpha&apos; and be careful when using it the first time.


CONFIGURATION
       The    configuration    file    for    this    backend     resides     in
       /etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf.

       Its  contents is a list of device names that correspond to Nikon Coolscan
       scanners. Empty lines and  lines  starting  with  a  hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:

        #scsi Vendor Model Type
        scsi Nikon * Scanner
        /dev/scanner

       The  special  device  name  must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to
       such a device.  To find out to which device your scanner is assigned  and
       how  you  have  to  set  the  permissions  of that device, have a look at
       sane-scsi.


SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
       Some SCSI-adapters and low-level SCSI drivers do not work correctly  with
       this backend and the Coolscan scanners. These systems hang when the auto&#8208;
       focus command is send to the Scanner.  To see a list of which card/driver
       combinations     work     or     dont    work    have    a    look    at:

FILES
       The backend configuration file:
              /etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf

       The static library implementing this backend:
              /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-coolscan.a

       The shared library implementing this backend:
              /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-coolscan.so (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading)


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity: SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN values

              Examples:

              on bash:
              export SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN=8

              on csh:
              setenv SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN 8


BUGS
       The autofocus command does not work with some SCSI  card/driver  combina&#8208;
       tions

       The gamma table is not implemented for the LS1000 yet.

       The dust-removal is not working yet

THANKS TO
       Didier  Carlier - For writing the original Coolscan backend (without it I
       would not have started this)

       Oliver Rauch - For adapting xsane so quickly to the infrared stuff.

       All the other people working on SANE.
