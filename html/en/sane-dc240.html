NAME
       sane-dc240 - SANE backend for Kodak DC240 Digital Camera

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-dc240 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to the Kodak DC240  camera.  THIS  IS  EXTREMELY
       ALPHA CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

DEVICE NAMES
       The  current  version  of  the  backend only allows one camera to be con&#8208;
       nected.  The device name is always &quot;0&quot;.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the dc240.conf specify the serial port and baud  rate  to
       use.   The  baud rate specifies the maximum rate to use while downloading
       pictures.  (The camera  is  always  initialized  using  9600  baud,  then
       switches  to  the  higher  rate).  On a 450MHz Pentium, I usually have no
       problems downloading at 115200 baud, though the camera sometimes  has  to
       resend  packets  due  to  lost  characters.   Results are better when the
       &quot;interrupt-unmask flag&quot; is set in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1).  Supported
       baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some  information  about the camera to be
       printed.

       cmdrespause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a)  between  writing
       the command and reading the result should be used. 125000 seems to be the
       lowest I could go reliably.

       breakpause is the time in 1,000,000ths of  a  usec  between  sending  the
       &quot;back to default&quot; break sending commands.

       Empty  lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sam&#8208;
       ple configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry
              cmdrespause=125000
              breakpause=1000000

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc240.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dc240.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dc240.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC240
              If the library was compiled with debugging support  enabled,  this
              environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  A
              value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller lev&#8208;
              els reduce verbosity.

AUTHOR
       Peter S. Fales


       This  backend  borrows heavily from the dc210 backend by Brian J. Murrell
       which is based somewhat on the dc25 backend by Peter Fales.

       The manpage was largely copied from the dc210 manpage.


BUGS
       The major limitation that I know of  is  that  the  backend  assumes  the
       directory in the camera is 100dc240.  Once the camera has taken more than
       9999 pictures, the directory will increment to 101dc240.  Not only should
       we check for the additional directory, but pictures may actually be found
       in multiple directories.

       More general comments, suggestions, and inquiries about frontends or SANE
       should    go    to    the    SANE    Developers    mailing    list   (see
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details).  You must be
       subscribed  to  the  list,  otherwise your mail won&apos;t be sent to the sub&#8208;
       scribers.
