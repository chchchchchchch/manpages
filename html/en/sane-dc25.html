NAME
       sane-dc25 - SANE backend for Kodak DC20/DC25 Digital Cameras

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-dc25 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to Kodak DC20 and DC25 cameras.   At  present,  only
       the DC25 has been tested, but since the code is based on a DC20 interface
       program, it is likely to work for that model also.

DEVICE NAMES
       The current version of the backend only allows  one  camera  to  be  con&#8208;
       nected.  The device name is always &quot;0&quot;.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the dc25.conf specify the serial port and baud rate to
       use.  The baud rate specifies the maximum rate to use  while  downloading
       pictures.   (The  camera  is  always  initialized  using  9600 baud, then
       switches to the higher rate).  On my 90MHz Pentium,  I  usually  have  no
       problems  downloading  at 115200 baud as long as the system is not exces&#8208;
       sively busy and the &quot;interrupt-unmask flag&quot; is  set  in  the  IDE  driver
       (hdparm  -u1).   Supported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and
       115200.

       The dumpinquiry line causes some  information  about  the  camera  to  be
       printed  to  stderr  during  startup.  Note:  This is not compatible with
       saned, so make sure you don&apos;t have any dumpinquiry lines if you are using
       saned (i.e. scanning on a remote machine using a network).

       Empty  lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sam&#8208;
       ple configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc25.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dc25.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dc25.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC25
              If the library was compiled with debugging support  enabled,  this
              environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  A
              value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller lev&#8208;
              els reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Known bugs/limitations are:

       I haven&apos;t figured out how to trigger an option reload following a &quot;scan.&quot;
       This causes problems when a new  picture  is  snapped  for  example,  the
       slider  that  is  used  to  select the picture from the camera may not be
       updated immediately.
