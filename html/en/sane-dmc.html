NAME
       sane-dmc - SANE backend for the Polaroid Digital Microscope Camera

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-dmc library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to the Polaroid Digital Microscope Camera.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special  device  that  corre&#8208;
       sponds  to  the  scanner.  The special device name must be a generic SCSI
       device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such  a  device  name
       could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example.

IMAGING MODES
       The  Polaroid  DMC  supports a number of imaging modes.  This driver sup&#8208;
       ports five of the imaging modes:

       Full Frame
              This mode corresponds to the  801-by-600  pixel  full-color  full-
              frame image.

       Viewfinder
              This   mode   corresponds   to  the  270-by-201  pixel  grey-scale
              viewfinder image.  This image is acquired very quickly.

       Raw    This mode corresponds to the 1599-by-600 pixel  &quot;raw&quot;  image  from
              the  CCD.   It is grey-scale, with pixels alternating horizontally
              between red, green and blue stripes.  The pixels are twice as high
              as they are wide, so the image is distorted.

       Thumbnail
              This  mode  corresponds to the 80-by-60 pixel full-color thumbnail
              image.

       Super Resolution
              This image is a 1599-by-1200 pixel full-color image constructed by
              filtering  and  interpolating  the &quot;raw&quot; image.  The filtering and
              interpolation is done in software, so  this  mode  is  very  slow.
              Also, this mode places restrictions on how the image is read which
              means that the &quot;preview&quot; mode of xscanimage does not work in Super
              Resolution mode.  (xcam and the non-preview modes of scanimage and
              xscanimage work fine, however.)

OTHER SETTINGS
       ASA Setting
              This setting adjusts the camera&apos;s sensitivity.  You can choose one
              of 25, 50, or 100 &quot;equivalent&quot; ASA.

       Shutter Speed
              You  can  select a shutter speed from 8 to 1000 milliseconds.  The
              shutter speed is quantized in units of 32 microseconds.

       White Balance
              You can choose one of &quot;Daylight&quot;, &quot;Incandescent&quot; or  &quot;Fluorescent&quot;
              white  balances.   This  setting  more-or-less  corresponds to the
              &quot;Color Temperature&quot; settings on Polaroid&apos;s Windows and  Mac  soft&#8208;
              ware.
&#12;CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of the dmc.conf file is a list of device names that corre&#8208;
       spond to DMC scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a  hash  mark
       (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dmc.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dmc.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-dmc.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DMC
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       In the &quot;Full Frame&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; modes, images must  be  read  in  units  of
       entire  lines.   The  driver performs no buffering in these modes; if you
       ask sane_read to read a non-integral number of lines, it  may  read  less
       than  you ask for.  If you ask sane_read to read less than a single line,
       it returns SANE_STATUS_INVAL.

       In the &quot;Super Resolution&quot; mode, images must be read in units of two lines
       (3198 pixels or 9594 bytes.)  If you try to read less than two lines, you
       get SANE_STATUS_INVAL.  The Super Resolution mode is very slow.

       In the &quot;Viewfinder&quot; and &quot;Thumbnail&quot; modes, the entire image must be  read
       in  one  SCSI  transfer.  In this case, the driver performs buffering and
       you can read the image in as small an increment as you like.
