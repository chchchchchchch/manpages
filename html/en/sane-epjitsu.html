NAME
       sane-epjitsu - SANE backend for Epson-based Fujitsu USB scanners.


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-epjitsu  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend which provides basic  access  the  Fujitsu  fi-60F  and  ScanSnap
       S300/S1300 scanners.


HARDWARE SUPPORT
       These  scanners are fairly limited, only supporting a couple of modes and
       resolutions, and always scanning full width. The backend supports missing
       modes  (binary,  grayscale)  in  software,  but  makes no effort to offer
       intermediate resolutions or scan area controls. See KNOWN ISSUES.

       This backend may support other scanners. If physical  inspection  reveals
       an  Epson chipset, please contact the author for instructions on collect&#8208;
       ing a USB trace under Windows to verify.


OPTIONS
       A limited effort has been made to expose the standard options to the API.
       This  allows a frontend to set resolution, color mode, and choose the ADF
       setting. The epjitsu backend supports the  following  basic  options  for
       most scanners:

       source s
              Selects  the  source  for the scan. Options may include &quot;Flatbed&quot;,
              &quot;ADF Front&quot;, &quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.

       mode m
              Selects the mode for the  scan.  Options  may  include  &quot;Lineart&quot;,
              &quot;Gray&quot;, &quot;Color&quot;.

       resolution, y-resolution
              Controls scan resolution. Setting --resolution also sets --y-reso&#8208;
              lution, though this behavior is overridden by some frontends.

       Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner.
       Use  &apos;scanimage  --help&apos;  to  get  a list. Be aware that some options may
       appear only when another option has been set, and that  advanced  options
       may be hidden by the frontend.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file  &quot;/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf&quot;  is used to tell the
       backend how to look for scanners, and  provide  options  controlling  the
       operation  of  the backend. This file is read each time the frontend asks
       the backend for a list of scanners,  generally  only  when  the  frontend
       starts. If the configuration file is missing, the backend will not work.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in two ways:

       &quot;usb 0x04c5 0x10c7&quot; (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests  backend  to  search  all  usb busses in the system for a
              device which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then
              be queried to determine if it is a supported scanner.

       &quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
              Some  systems  use  a  kernel  driver to access usb scanners. This
              method is untested.
&#12;       The only configuration  option  supported  is  &quot;firmware  /PATH/TO/FILE&quot;,
       allowing  you to set the location of the firmware file you have extracted
       from the Windows driver.

       Note: This firmware is a copyrighted work of Fujitsu, so cannot  be  pro&#8208;
       vided by the backend or the author. Please do not ask.

       Note:  These  scanners  REQUIRE a firmware file to function. See the sup&#8208;
       plied configuration file for more detail.

       Note: This option may appear multiple times in the configuration file. It
       only  applies  to  scanners  discovered  by  &apos;usb&apos; lines that follow this
       option.

ENVIRONMENT
       The backend uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_EPJITSU, which
       enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 USB trace
              30 USB detail
              35 Useless noise


KNOWN ISSUES
              No scan area options are exposed.
              fi-60F hardware grayscale mode is not used.
