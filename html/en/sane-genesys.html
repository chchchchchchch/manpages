NAME
       sane-genesys  -  SANE  backend  for  GL646, GL841, GL843, GL847 and GL124
       based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-genesys library implements a  SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend that provides access to USB flatbed scanners based on the Genesys
       GL646, GL841 and GL847 chips.  At present,  the  following  scanners  are
       known to work with this backend:

              Canon LiDE 35/40/50/60/100/110/200/210
              Hewlett-Packard HP2300C/HP3670/HP3690
              Medion MD5345/MD6228/MD6274
              Panasonic KV-SS080
              Plustek OpticBook 3600
              Pentax DSmobile 600
              Syscan/Ambir DocketPORT 467/485/487/665/685
              Visioneer  OneTouch  7100/Strobe XP100 (rev3)/XP200/XP300/Roadwar&#8208;

       This is stable software for supported models. But  if  you  test  new  or
       untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanner&apos;s plug and unplug it, if
       the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed  above  that  works  with
       this  backend,  please  let  me  know this by sending the scanner&apos;s exact
       model  name  and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids   (e.g.   from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  sane-find-scanner  or  syslog)  to the sane-devel
       mailing list. Even if the scanner&apos;s name is only slightly different  from
       the models mentioned above, please let me know.

       If you own a scanner that isn&apos;t detected by the genesys backend but has a
       GL646, GL841, GL843 or GL847 chipset, you can try to add it to the  back&#8208;
       end.

CALIBRATION
       To  give  correct image quality, sheet fed scanners need to be calibrated
       using the calibration sheet sold with the scanner. To do calibration, you
       must  insert  this  target in the feeder then start calibration either by
       passing the --calibrate option to scanimage or by clicking on the  avail&#8208;
       able  &apos;calibrate&apos;  button  in the &apos;advanced options&apos; in a graphical fron&#8208;
       tend. The result of the calibration is stored  in  a  file  in  the  home
       directory  of  the  user  doing  it.   If you plug the scanner in another
       machine or use it with another  account,  calibration  will  have  to  be
       redone.


EXTRAS SCAN OPTIONS
       --lamp-off-time number
                      The  lamp will be turned off after the given time (in min&#8208;
              utes). A value of 0 means that the lamp won&apos;t be turned off.

       --threshold percent
                   0..100% (in steps of 1). Select minimum brightness to  get  a
              white  point.  Pixels  whith  brightness  below that value will be
              scanned as black.

       --disable-interpolation yes|no
                      When using high resolutions where the  horizontal  resolu&#8208;
              tion  is  smaller  than  vertical  resolution, data is expanded by
              software to preserve picture geometry. This can be disbled by this
              option to get real scanned data.

       --color-filter None|Red|Green|Blue
                      When  using  gray  or lineart this option selects the used
              color. Using a color filter will give a monochrome scan. CIS based
              scanners can to true gray when no filter (None value) is selected.


       Additionally,  several  &apos;software&apos;  options  are  exposed by the backend.
       These are reimplementations of features provided natively by larger scan&#8208;
       ners,  but running on the host computer. This enables smaller machines to
       have similar capabilites. Please note that these  features  are  somewhat
       simplistic,  and  may  not perform as well as the native implementations.
       Note also that these features all  require  that  the  driver  cache  the
       entire  image in memory. This will almost certainly result in a reduction
       of scanning speed.

       --swcrop
                   Requests the driver to detect the extremities  of  the  paper
              within the larger image, and crop the empty edges.

       --swdeskew
                   Requests  the  driver  to  detect  the  rotation of the paper
              within the larger image, and counter the rotation.

       --swdespeck --despeck X
                   Requests the driver to find and remove dots of X diameter  or
              smaller  from  the image, and fill the space with the average sur&#8208;
              rounding color.


SYSTEM ISSUES
       This backend needs libusb-0.1.6 or later installed, and hasn&apos;t tested  in
       other  configuration  than  a  linux  kernel 2.6.9 or higher. However, it
       should work any system with libusb where the SANE  package  can  be  com&#8208;
       piled.  For  setting  permissions  and  general  USB  information look at
       sane-usb(5).



CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the genesys.conf file is a list of usb  lines  containing
       vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also
       contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with  a  hash  mark
       (#)  are  ignored.   The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id prod&#8208;
       uct_id statements which are already included  into  genesys.conf.   &quot;ven&#8208;
       dor_id&quot;  and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify the scan&#8208;
       ner.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/genesys.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-genesys.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-genesys.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.  If  the
              debug  level  is  set  to  1  or higher, some debug options become
              available that are normally hidden. Handle them  with  care.  This
              will print messages related to core genesys functions.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_LOW
              This  environment  variable controls the debug level for low level
              functions common to all genesys ASICs.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646
              This environment variable controls the debug level  for  the  spe&#8208;
              cific GL646 code part.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL841
              This  environment  variable  controls the debug level for the spe&#8208;
              cific GL841 code part.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL843
              This environment variable controls the debug level  for  the  spe&#8208;
              cific GL843 code part.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL847
              This  environment  variable  controls the debug level for the spe&#8208;
              cific GL847 code part.

       SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL124
              This environment variable controls the debug level  for  the  spe&#8208;
              cific GL124 code part.


              Example (full and highly verbose output for gl646):
              export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS=255
              export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_LOW=255
              export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646=255

LIMITATIONS
       Powersaving isn&apos;t implemented for gl646 based scanner.

       This backend will be much slower if not using libusb-1.0. So be sure that
       sane-backends is built with the --enable-libusb_1_0 option.


BUGS
       Currently no known bug.
