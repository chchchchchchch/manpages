NAME
       sane-geniusvp2  -  SANE  backend  for  Genius ColorPage-Vivid Pro II (PP)
       scanner

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-geniusvp2 backend  supports  EICI  091000  based  parallel  port
       flatbed  scanners.  This ASIC can be found on some Primax devices, and on
       the Genius ColorPage-Vivid Pro II scanner (which is actually a Primax OEM
       device).

SUPPORTED DEVICES
       The following scanner should work with this backend:

       Device Details
       -----------------------------
       Vendor: Genius
       Model: ColorPage-Vivid Pro II
       FCC ID: EMJFB308C
       MODEL NO: FB601C

       Chipset Details
       ----------------------------------
       ASIC ID: 0xE1
       Product ID: 0x06
       ASIC: EICI 091000
       AFE: Wolfson WM-8143-12
       Memory: NEC uPD424210-60 (256 Kb?)

CONFIGURATION
       This  section decribes the backend&apos;s configuration file entries. The file
       is located at:

              /etc/sane.d/geniusvp2.conf

       For a proper setup, you will need at least this entry:

              device parport0

       Currently, only access through ppdev is supported.

PARALLEL PORT MODES
       Only EPP mode (including &quot;EPP+ECP&quot;) is  supported.  Future  versions  may
       include support for the (slower) SPP mode.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/geniusvp2.conf
              The backend configuration file

       /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-geniusvp2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-geniusvp2.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories &quot;/tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GENIUSVP2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GENIUSVP2=10

              To obtain debug messages from the backend,  set  this  environment
              variable before calling your favorite frontend (e.g. xscanimage).

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GENIUSVP2=10 ; xscanimage

KNOWN BUGS AND RESTRICTIONS
       Scan  may  sometimes timeout due to the scanner&apos;s buffer not being filled
       after some reasonable time, and you get a truncated image. Just try scan&#8208;
       ning again and it should work.

       Scans  at  high  resolutions (e.g. 600 dpi.) may also be truncated if the
       selected scan area is too large. Just scan at lower (&lt;= 300 dpi.) resolu&#8208;
       tions for now if you want a larger image.

       The  lamp carriage may sometimes go out of its maximum distance (297 mm),
       forcing the motor engine. You can detect this when the scanner produces a
       &quot;strange&quot; noise and the carriage is at its maximum distance from home. In
       this situation, turn off scanner power imediately, or you may risk damage
       your  device. This seems to happen more often when scanning full pages at
       high resolutions.
