sane-gphoto2(5)           SANE Scanner Access Now Easy           sane-gphoto2(5)



NAME
       sane-gphoto2 - SANE backend for gphoto2 supported cameras

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-gphoto2  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the digital cameras supported by gphoto2.
       This  backend  has  only  been  tested  with a handful of cameras so far.
       Patches to support other models are welcome.

       Because of the limited testing of this backend, it is  commented  out  in
       /etc/sane.d/dll.conf  by  default.   Either the comment character must be
       removed or the backend must be called  explicitly.   E.g.  `scanimage  -d
       gphoto2&apos; or `xscanimage gphoto2&apos;.

DEVICE NAMES
       The  current  version  of  the  backend only allows one camera to be con&#8208;
       nected.  The device name is always &quot;0&quot;.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the gphoto2.conf specify the characteristics of the  cam&#8208;
       era  to  be  used.    Resolutions  (high  resolution, low resolution, and
       thumbnail size) are required since they are needed by the sane frontends,
       but  can&apos;t  be  obtained  through the gphoto2 interface.  Valid ports and
       cameras  can  be  obtained  by  &quot;gphoto2  --list-cameras&quot;  and   &quot;gphoto2
       --list-ports&quot;.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some  information  about the camera to be
       printed.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A  sam&#8208;
       ple configuration file is shown below:

       The  &quot;topfolder&quot;  line  specifies the &quot;fixed&quot; part of the file path.  For
       example,  on  the  Kodak  DC-240,  files  are  stored  in  the  directory
       /DCIM/100DC240.   The /DCIM portion is constant, but 100DC240 will change
       and must be read from the camera.  In this  case,  the  line  would  read
       &quot;topfolder=/DCIM&quot;

       Some  cameras  don&apos;t implement a file structure and store all pictures in
       the &quot;/&quot; directory.  This is indicated by setting &quot;subdirs=0&quot;  with  &quot;top&#8208;
       folder=/&quot;

              port=usb:
              camera=Kodak DC240
              # this is a comment
              high_resolution=1280x960
              low_resolution=640x480
              thumb_resolution=160x120
              dumpinquiry

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/gphoto2.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-gphoto2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-gphoto2.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).
&#12;
ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GPHOTO2
              If  the  library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this
              environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  A
              value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller lev&#8208;
              els reduce verbosity.

       GP_DEBUG
              Set to 1, 2, or 3, to enable various levels  of  debugging  within
              the gphoto2 libraries.

BUGS
       Many, no doubt.
