sane-gt68xx(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-gt68xx(5)



NAME
       sane-gt68xx - SANE backend for GT-68XX based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-gt68xx library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to USB flatbed scanners based on  the  Grandtech
       GT-6801  and GT-6816 chips.  A list of supported scanners can be found on
       the                gt68xx                backend                homepage:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/.

       This  is  BETA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
       keep your hand at the scanner&apos;s plug and unplug it, if the head bumps  at
       the end of the scan area.

       If  you  own  a scanner other than the ones listed on the gt68xx homepage
       that works with this backend, please let me  know  this  by  sending  the
       scanner&apos;s  exact  model name and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
       sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner&apos;s  name  is  only
       slightly  different  from  the models already listed as supported, please
       let me know.

       If you own a scanner that isn&apos;t detected by the gt68xx backend but has  a
       GT-6801  or GT-6816 chipset, you can try to add it to the backend. Have a
       look         at         the         following          web          page:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/adding.html

LIBUSB ISSUES
       Please  use  libusb-0.1.8  or  later. Without libusb or with older libusb
       versions all kinds of trouble can be  expected.  The  scanner  should  be
       found  by  sane-find-scanner without further actions. For setting permis&#8208;
       sions and general USB information looks at sane-usb(5).

FIRMWARE FILE
       You need a firmware file for your scanner. That&apos;s a small file containing
       software  that  will  be  uploaded  to the scanner&apos;s memory. It&apos;s usually
       named *.usb, e.g.  PS1fw.usb.  It comes on the installation CD  that  was
       provided  by  the  manufacturer, but it may be packaged together with the
       installation program in an .exe file. For Mustek scanners, the  file  can
       be downloaded from the gt68xx backend homepage. For other scanners, check
       the CD for .usb files. If you only find *.cab files,  try  cabextract  to
       unpack. If everything else fails, you must install the Windows driver and
       get the firmware from there (usually in the  windows/system  or  system32
       directories).  Put that firmware file into /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/.  Make
       sure that it&apos;s readable by everyone.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the gt68xx.conf file is a list of  usb  lines  containing
       vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also
       contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with  a  hash  mark
       (#)  are  ignored.   The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id prod&#8208;
       uct_id statements which are already  included  into  gt68xx.conf.   &quot;ven&#8208;
       dor_id&quot;  and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify the scan&#8208;
       ner.

       The override, firmware, vendor, model, and afe  options  must  be  placed
       after the usb line they refer to.

       Option  override is used to override the default model parameters. That&apos;s
       necessary for some scanners that use the same vendor/product ids but  are
       different.  For  these  scanners there are already commented out override
       lines   in   the    configuration    file.     override    mustek-scanex&#8208;
       press-1200-ub-plus  is necessary for the Mustek Scanexpress 1200 UB Plus,
       the Medion/Lifetec/Tevion LT 9452, and the Trust Compact Scan USB  19200.
       override  artec-ultima-2000 is used for the Artec Ultima 2000, the Boeder
       SmartScan Slim Edition, the Medion/ Lifetec/ Tevion/ Cytron  MD/LT  9385,
       the  Medion/  Lifetec/ Tevion MD 9458, and the Trust Flat Scan USB 19200.
       override mustek-bearpaw-2400-cu is necessary for the Mustek BearPaw  2400
       CU  and  the  Fujitsu  1200CUS. The override option must be the first one
       after the usb line.

       Option firmware selects the name and path of the firmware file. It&apos;s only
       necessary if the default (or override) doesn&apos;t work. The default firmware
       directory is /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/.  You may need to create this direc&#8208;
       tory.  If you want to place the firmware files at a different path, use a
       firmware line.

       The vendor and model options are not absolutely necessary but for  conve&#8208;
       nience.  Quite  a  lot of scanners from different manufacturers share the
       same vendor/product ids so you can set the &quot;correct&quot; name here.

       The afe option allows to set custom offset and gain values for the Analog
       FrontEnd of the scanner. This option can be either used to select the AFE
       values if automatic coarse calibration is disabled, or to make  automatic
       coarse  calibration  faster.  For  the latter usage, enable debug level 3
       (see below), scan an image and look for debug  line  string  with  &quot;afe&quot;.
       Copy  this  line to gt68xx.conf.  The option has six parameters: red off&#8208;
       set, red gain, green offset, green gain, blue offset, and blue gain.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              usb 0x05d8 0x4002
              override &quot;mustek-scanexpress-1200-ub-plus&quot;
              firmware &quot;/opt/gt68xx/SBfw.usb&quot;
              vendor &quot;Trust&quot;
              model &quot;Compact Scan USB 19200&quot;
              afe 0x20 0x02 0x22 0x03 0x1f 0x04


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/gt68xx.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-gt68xx.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-gt68xx.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.  If  the
              debug  level  is  set  to  1  or higher, some debug options become
              available that are normally hidden. Handle them with care.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX=4

AUTHOR
       Henning Meier-Geinitz &lt;henning@meier-geinitz.de&gt;
       The  original gt68xx driver was written by Sergey Vlasov, Andreas Nowack,
       and David Stevenson. Thanks for sending patches and  answering  questions
       to them and all the other contributors.


BUGS
       The first few lines of the image are garbage for the 2400 TA Plus.

       Interpolation  should  be  used instead of just copying data, when the X-
       and Y-resolution differ.

       Support for buttons is missing.

       More detailed bug information is available at the gt68xx backend homepage
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/.   Please  contact us if
       you find a bug or missing feature:  &lt;sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org&gt;.
       Please  send  a  debug  log if your scanner isn&apos;t detected correctly (see
       SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX above).
