NAME
       sane-hp - SANE backend for HP ScanJet scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-hp  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to HP ScanJet scanners which  support  SCL  (Scanner
       Control  Language by HP).  The following scanners are known positively to
       work with this backend:

              Model:         Product id:     Interface:
              ----------     -----------     ----------
              ScanJet Plus   C9195A          HP Parallel Interface Card
              ScanJet IIc    C1750A 3226     SCSI
              ScanJet IIcx   C2500A 3332     SCSI
              ScanJet IIp    C1790A          SCSI
              ScanJet 3C     C2520A 3503     SCSI
              ScanJet 3P     C2570A 3406     SCSI
              ScanJet 4C     C2520A          SCSI
              ScanJet 4P     C1130A 3540     SCSI
              ScanJet 4100C  C6290A          USB
              ScanJet 5P     C5110A          SCSI
              ScanJet 5100C  C5190A          parallel port
              ScanJet 5200C  C7190A 3846     parallel port/USB
              ScanJet 6100C  C2520A 3644     SCSI
              ScanJet 6200C  C6270A 3828     SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6250C  C6270A 3828     SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6300C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6350C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6390C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              PhotoSmart     C5100A R029,R030,R032    SCSI

       Support for models 5100C/5200C connected to the  parallel  port  requires
       the    ppSCSI    driver    available    at   http://cyberelk.net/tim/par&#8208;
       port/ppscsi.html and http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/.


       Support for models 5200C/62X0C/63X0C connected to  the  USB  require  the
       kernel scanner driver or libusb. See sane-usb(5) for more details.

       The &quot;hp&quot; backend no longer supports OfficeJet multi-function peripherals.
       For these devices use the external &quot;hpoj&quot; backend  in  version  0.90  and
       later of the &quot;HP OfficeJet Linux driver&quot;, available at
       http://hpoj.sourceforge.net

       Because  Hewlett-Packard does no longer produce scanners that support SCL
       (beside the OfficeJets), the above list of  supported  scanners  is  com&#8208;
       plete.   Other  HP  scanners  are  not supported by the &quot;hp&quot; backend, but
       might be supported by another one. See http://www.sane-project.org/.  You
       can     also     watch     the     sane-devel     mailing     list     at
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.

       More  details  about  the  hp  backend  can  be  found  on  its  homepage
       http://www.kirchgessner.net/sane.html.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special  is  the UNIX path-name for the special device that corre&#8208;
       sponds to the scanner.  For SCSI scanners the special device name must be
       a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a
       device name could be /dev/sga or /dev/sg2, for example.  If  the  special
       device  name contains &quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot; or &quot;ugen&quot;, it is assumed that the
       scanner is connected by USB.  For the HP ScanJet Plus the special  device
       name  must  be the device that corresponds to the parallel interface card
       that was shipped with the scanner. That is /dev/hpscan.  A special driver
       is required for this card.  See ftp://rvs.ctrl-c.liu.se/pub/wingel/hpscan
       for   details.   If   the   link   does   not   work,   try    ftp://sun&#8208;
       site.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/scanners.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the hp.conf file is a list of options and device names
       that correspond to HP ScanJet scanners.  Empty lines and  lines  starting
       with  a  hash  mark  (#) are ignored. See sane-scsi(5) and sane-usb(5) on
       details of what constitutes a valid device name.

       Options specified in front of the first line that contains a device  name
       are  defaults  for  all devices. Options specified below a line that con&#8208;
       tains a device name apply just to the most recently mentioned device.

       Supported options are connect-scsi, connect-device,  enable-image-buffer&#8208;
       ing, and dumb-read.

       Option connect-scsi specifies that the scanner is connected to the system
       by SCSI.  Input/output is performed  using  SCSI-commands.  This  is  the
       default.   But  if  your  SCSI  device name contains &quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot; or
       &quot;ugen&quot;, option connect-scsi must be specified. Otherwise  it  is  assumed
       that the scanner is connected by USB.

       Option connect-device specifies that the scanner is connected to the sys&#8208;
       tem   by   a   special   device.    Input/output    is    performed    by
       read()/write()-operations  on the device. This option must be used for HP
       ScanJet Plus or scanners connected to USB which are  accessed  through  a
       named  device  (e.g.  /dev/usb/scanner0).   For device names that contain
       &quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot; or &quot;ugen&quot;, it is not necessary to specify  option  con&#8208;
       nect-device.

       Option  enable-image-buffering  stores the scanned image in memory before
       passing it to the frontend. Could be used  in  case  of  forward/backward
       moving scanner lamp.

       Option  dumb-read  can be used to work around problems with &quot;Error during
       device I/O&quot;. These problems may occur with certain SCSI-to-USB converters
       or  Buslogic  SCSI cards.  The option should not be used for SCSI devices
       which are working correctly.  Otherwise startup of frontends and changing
       parameters might be slower.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/hpscan
                option connect-device

       /dev/scanner is typically a symlink to the actual SCSI scanner device.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hp.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

       $HOME/.sane/calib-hp:&lt;device&gt;.dat
              Calibration  data for HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner that is retrieved
              from the scanner after calibration. The data is  uploaded  to  the
              scanner  at  start  of  the  backend if it is in media mode &apos;print
              media&apos; or if the media mode is changed to &apos;print media&apos;.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_HP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

       SANE_HOME_HP
              Only  used for OS/2 and along with use of HP PhotoSmart PhotoScan&#8208;
              ner.  Must be set to the directory where the  directory  .sane  is
              located.  Is used to save and read the calibration file.

       SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_SCSI

       SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_USB

       SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_DEVICE
              For  each  type  of  connection  (connect-scsi,  connect-usb, con&#8208;
              nect-device) it can be specified if the connection to  the  device
              should  be  kept open (&quot;1&quot;) or not (&quot;0&quot;).  Usually the connections
              are closed after an operation is  performed.   Keeping  connection
              open  to  SCSI-devices  can result in errors during device IO when
              the scanner has not been used for some time. By default,  USB-con&#8208;
              nections are kept open. Other connections are closed.

       SANE_HP_RDREDO
              Specifies number of retries for read operation before returning an
              EOF error.  Only supported for non-SCSI devices. Default: 1 retry.
              Time between retries is 0.1 seconds.


BUGS
       HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner
              In media mode &apos;slide&apos; and &apos;negative&apos;, scan resolutions are rounded
              to multiple of 300 dpi. The scanner does not scale the  data  cor&#8208;
              rectly on other resolutions. Some newer models (firmware code R030
              and later) do not support adjustment of  contrast/intensity  level
              and  tone  map.   The  backend will simulate this by software, but
              only for gray and 24 bit color.

       Automatic Document Feeder (ADF)
              For use of the ADF with xscanimage(1), first place  paper  in  the
              ADF  and  then  change  option scan source to &apos;ADF&apos;. Press &apos;change
              document&apos; to load a sheet. Then press  &apos;scan&apos;  to  start  a  scan.
              Maybe  it  is sufficient to press &apos;scan&apos; without &apos;change document&apos;
              for repeated scans. The use of the preview window  is  not  recom&#8208;
              mended  when  working with the ADF.  Setting a window to scan from
              ADF is not supported with xscanimage(1).  Try xsane(1).

       Immediate actions
              Some actions in xscanimage(1) (i.e. unload,  select  media,  cali&#8208;
              brate)  have an immediate effect on the scanner without starting a
              scan.  These options can not be used with scanimage.


TODO
       HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner
              PhotoScanners with firmware release R030 and up have  no  firmware
              support  for contrast/brightness/gamma table. In the current back&#8208;
              end this is simulated by software on 24 bits data.  Simulation  on
              30 bits should give better results.

       Data widths greater than 8 bits
              Custom gamma table does not work.

       Parallel scanner support
              Beside the ScanJet Plus which came with its own parallel interface
              card, currently only the HP  ScanJet  5100C/5200C  are  supported.
              These  scanners  are  using an internal parallel-to-SCSI converter
              which is supported by the ppSCSI-driver (see above).
