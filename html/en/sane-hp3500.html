sane-hp3500(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-hp3500(5)



NAME
       sane-hp3500  - SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 3500 series scan&#8208;
       ners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hp3500 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end  that  provides  access  to the following Hewlett-Packard USB flatbed
       scanners:

              ScanJet 3500C
              ScanJet 3530C
              ScanJet 3570C

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed  above  that  works  with
       this  backend,  please  let  us  know this by sending the scanner&apos;s exact
       model  name  and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids   (e.g.   from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  sane-find-scanner  or  syslog) to us. Even if the
       scanner&apos;s name is only  slightly  different  from  the  models  mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       None required.

FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp3500.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp3500.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_HP3500 If the library was compiled with debug support enabled,
       this  environment  variable  controls  the  debug level for this backend.
       Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

       Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP3500=4
