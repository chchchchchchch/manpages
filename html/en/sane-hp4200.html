sane-hp4200(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-hp4200(5)



NAME
       sane-hp4200 - SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard 4200 scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hp4200 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to the  following  Hewlett-Packard  USB  flatbed
       scanners:

              ScanJet 4200 C
              ScanJet 4200 Cxi
              ScanJet 4200 Cse

       More   details   can   be   found   on   the   hp4200   backend  homepage
       http://hp4200-backend.sourceforge.net/.

       This is BETA software. Keep your hand at the scanner&apos;s  plug  and  unplug
       it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

       If  you  own  a  scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
       this backend, please let us know this  by  sending  the  scanner&apos;s  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices, sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us.  Even  if  the
       scanner&apos;s  name  is  only  slightly  different  from the models mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the hp4200.conf file is a list of  usb  lines  containing
       vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also
       contain the names of device files that correspond to an HP 4200  scanner.
       Empty  lines  and  lines  starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  The
       scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id  product_id  statements  which
       are  already included into hp4200.conf.  &quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot; are
       hexadecimal numbers that identify the scanner. If autodetection does  not
       work, add the device name of your scanner to the configuration file, e.g.
       /dev/usb/scanner0.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hp4200.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp4200.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp4200.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).
&#12;       SANE_DEBUG_HP4200
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP4200=4

BUGS
       Tested only with Linux.

       Only 8 bit color mode works.

       Scanning is slow due to backtracking.

       Send    bug    reports    to     the     sane-devel     mailing     list:
       sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.
