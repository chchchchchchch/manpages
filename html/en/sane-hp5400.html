sane-hp5400(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-hp5400(5)



NAME
       sane-hp5400 - SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard 54XX scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hp5400 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to the  following  Hewlett-Packard  USB  flatbed
       scanners:

              ScanJet 5400C
              ScanJet 5470C
              ScanJet 5490C

       More   details   can   be   found   on   the   hp5400   backend  homepage
       http://hp5400backend.sourceforge.net/.

       This is ALPHA software. Keep your hand at the scanner&apos;s plug  and  unplug
       it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan area. See also the BUGS sec&#8208;
       tion.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed  above  that  works  with
       this  backend,  please  let  us  know this by sending the scanner&apos;s exact
       model  name  and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids   (e.g.   from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  sane-find-scanner  or  syslog) to us. Even if the
       scanner&apos;s name is only  slightly  different  from  the  models  mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the hp5400.conf file is a list of usb lines containing
       vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also
       contain  the names of device files that correspond to an HP 54XX scanner.
       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark  (#)  are  ignored.   The
       scanners  are  autodetected  by usb vendor_id product_id statements which
       are already included into hp5400.conf.  &quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot;  are
       hexadecimal  numbers that identify the scanner. If autodetection does not
       work, add the device name of your scanner to the configuration file, e.g.
       /dev/usb/scanner0.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hp5400.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp5400.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp5400.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_HP5400
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP5400=4

BUGS
       Scanning  is  only tested with Linux/ix86/gcc. Be careful when testing on
       other operating systems and especially on big-endian platforms. The scan&#8208;
       ner may get wrong data.
