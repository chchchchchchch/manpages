sane-hp5590(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-hp5590(5)



NAME
       sane-hp5590       -       SANE      backend      for      Hewlett-Packard
       4500C/4570C/5500C/5550C/5590/7650 Workgroup/Document scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hp5590 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to the following Hewlett-Packard Workgroup/Docu&#8208;
       ment scanners:

              ScanJet 4500C
              ScanJet 4570C
              ScanJet 5500C
              ScanJet 5550C
              ScanJet 5590
              ScanJet 7650

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed  above  that  works  with
       this  backend,  please  let  us  know this by sending the scanner&apos;s exact
       model  name  and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids   (e.g.   from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices,  sane-find-scanner  or  syslog) to us. Even if the
       scanner&apos;s name is only  slightly  different  from  the  models  mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       None required.

FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp5590.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hp5590.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_HP5590
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output. See used
              levels below.

              Level 10 - generic processing
              Level 20 - verbose backend messages
              Level 40 - HP5590 high-level commands
              Level 50 - HP5590 low-level (USB-in-USB) commands


              Example:

              export SANE_DEBUG_HP5590=50
