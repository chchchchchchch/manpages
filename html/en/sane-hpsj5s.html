sane-hpsj5s(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-hpsj5s(5)



NAME
       sane-hpsj5s - SANE backend for HP ScanJet 5S sheet-fed scanner

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hpsj5s library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to a parallel port  Hewlett-Packard  ScanJet  5S
       scanner.

       IMPORTANT:  this is alpha code. Don&apos;t expect this to work correctly. Many
       functions are missing, others contain errors. In some  cases,  your  com&#8208;
       puter  might  even  hang.  It  cannot be excluded (although I consider it
       extremely improbable) that your scanner will be damaged.

       LIMITATIONS: For now this backend works only on Linux.   This  limitation
       is  due to dependence on the libieee1284 library. If your system supports
       libieee1284 too, this backend should work. If you ported libieee1284  for
       your  platform,  please  let  me know. Your system should support EPP (or
       EPP+ECP ) mode to operate this scanner. Future versions will support  ECP
       and  SPP  (Nibble  and Byte) modes also. It&apos;s planned to support scanners
       not only at daisy-chain position 0, but anywhere.  Support  for  multiple
       scanners could be implemented too.

       Current  version  implements only gray scale scanning. True Color and B/W
       modes are not supported for now.

       That said, TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments to Max
       Vorobiev &lt;pcwizard@yandex.ru&gt;.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special is the parallel port name in form, libieee1284 expects. It
       seems to be system dependent.  Under Linux it&apos;s parport0, parport1, etc.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the hpsj5s.conf file is a list of parport names that cor&#8208;
       respond to HP ScanJet 5S scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.   Only  one  device  name  can  be  listed  in
       hpsj5s.conf  for  this  moment.  Future versions will support daisy chain
       selection.


TIPS
       It seems that HP ScanJet 5S scanner uses software noise correction.  This
       feature is not implemented for now. So does gamma correction and calibra&#8208;
       tion.  I&apos;ll handle it in future versions.   Native  resolution  for  this
       scanner is 300 DPI. Other modes could be jagged in some ways.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hpsj5s.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hpsj5s.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hpsj5s.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).
&#12;ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).
