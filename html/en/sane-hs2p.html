sane-hs2p(5)              SANE Scanner Access Now Easy              sane-hs2p(5)



NAME
       sane-hs2p - SANE backend for Ricoh SCSI flatbed/ADF scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hs2p library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to the Ricoh IS450 family of scanners.  Should  also
       work  with  the IS420, IS410, and IS430 scanners, but these are untested.
       Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel mailing list if  you  own
       such a scanner.

       This backend is alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some scanners haven&apos;t
       been tested at all. Be careful and pull the plug if  the  scanner  causes
       unusual noise.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special is either the path-name for the special device that corre&#8208;
       sponds to a SCSI scanner. The program sane-find-scanner helps to find out
       the  correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sg0 or
       /dev/sga, for example.  See sane-scsi(5) for details.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the hs2p.conf file is a list of device names that  corre&#8208;
       spond  to SCSI scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
       (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
       device name.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hs2p.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hs2p.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-hs2p.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_HS2P
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.   A
              value  of 255 prints all debug output.  Smaller values reduce ver&#8208;
              bosity.


CURRENT STATUS
       The hs2p backend is now in version 1.00. All major scanning-related  fea&#8208;
       tures  are  supported,  except  for those features requiring the optional
       IPU. Scanning from the flatbed or ADF (either simplex or duplex) is  sup&#8208;
       ported. Lineart, halftone, 4-bit gray, and 8-bit gray are supported. Pre-
       set gamma tables and halftone patterns are supported, as well as  bright&#8208;
       ness,  threshold, contrast.  Also supported is scan wait mode, binary and
       gray filtering, negative scanning, and absolute or  relative  white  set&#8208;
       ting. Printing with the optional endorser also is supported.


PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY
       This  scanner can scan from the ADF in continuous simplex mode.  Surpris&#8208;
       ingly, many scanners scan an entire document from  the  ADF  into  memory
       before  ejecting the sheet. Thus if the document is too long, the scanner
       cannot hold the entire image data in memory.  But if  the  scanner  would
       send its image data when its memory got full, and then read the next buf&#8208;
       fer&apos;s worth of data, continuous scanning could be achieved.


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       The SCSI  commands  for  uploading  (2AH)  or  downloading  (28H)  custom
       halftone  patterns (02H) and gamma vectors (03H) should work, but require
       implementing the SANE Option-Value code to allow the user to  create  the
       tables  to  be  uploaded  to the scanner. No support for Maintenance Data
       (80H) is planned as this functionality is more suited  to  a  stand-alone
       utility  to  be used by a technician when replacing the lamp or ADF unit.
       Nor is support for reading or changing IPU (93H)  paramters  and  adjust&#8208;
       ments  planned,  since  my  IS450  lacks  such  a  unit. The 31-byte Auto
       Photo/Letter struct and 21-byte Dynamic threshold struct  are  documented
       in  the  hs2p-scsi.h  file should someone wish to use their IPU for image
       data processing.
