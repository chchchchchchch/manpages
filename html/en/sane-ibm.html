sane-ibm(5)               SANE Scanner Access Now Easy               sane-ibm(5)



NAME
       sane-ibm - SANE backend for IBM and Ricoh SCSI flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-ibm library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to the IBM 2456 and the Ricoh  IS-410,  IS-420,  and
       IS-430  flatbed  scanners. Support for the IS-410 and IS-430 is untested.
       Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel mailing list if  you  own
       such a scanner.

       This backend is alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some scanners haven&apos;t
       been tested at all. Be careful and pull the plug if  the  scanner  causes
       unusual noise.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special is either the path-name for the special device that corre&#8208;
       sponds to a SCSI scanner. The program sane-find-scanner helps to find out
       the  correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sg0 or
       /dev/sga, for example.  See sane-scsi(5) for details.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the ibm.conf file is a list of device names  that  corre&#8208;
       spond  to SCSI scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
       (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
       device name.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/ibm.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-ibm.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-ibm.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_IBM
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.
