sane-leo(5)               SANE Scanner Access Now Easy               sane-leo(5)



NAME
       sane-leo - SANE backend for LEO Technologies scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-leo library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to some LEO  SCSI  flatbed  scanners.  This  backend
       should  be  considered beta-quality software! LEO scanners were also sold
       under the Across Technologies brand.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           status
              ----------------------  -----------
                Across FS-1130          tested
                Leo S3                  tested

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       If you have any strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer
       or to the SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d leo


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects  the  basic mode of operation of the scanner valid choices
              are Black &amp; White , Grayscale and Color The Black &amp; White mode  is
              black and white only (1 bit). Grayscale will produce 256 levels of
              gray (8 bits). Color will produce a 24 bits color image.


       --resolution
              selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all  resolu&#8208;
              tions between 1 and 300, in increments of 1.



       Geometry options


       -l -t -x -y
              control  the  scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the  height  of
              the  scan  area.  All  parameters  are specified in millimeters by
              default.



       Enhancement options


       --custom-gamma
              (grayscale and color mode only) allows the user to specify a gamma
              table (see the next 3 parameters).


       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --green-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --halftone
              (Black &amp; White only) select the halftone  mask  to  use.  Possible
              values  are  Diamond , 8x8 Coarse Fatting , 8x8 Fine Fatting , 8x8
              Bayer and 8x8 Vertical Line


       --preview
              requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan  is  28
              dpi  and  the  scan  area is the maximum allowed. The scan mode is
              user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file /etc/sane.d/leo.conf supports  only  one  informa&#8208;
       tion: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-leo.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-leo.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_LEO
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       The  windows  TWAIN  driver has many more options than this SANE backend.
       However they are only software adjustments. This backend only  implements
       what the scanner can support.



BUGS
       None known.
