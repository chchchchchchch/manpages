sane-lexmark(5)           SANE Scanner Access Now Easy           sane-lexmark(5)



NAME
       sane-lexmark - SANE backend for Lexmark X1100/X1200 Series scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-lexmark  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the scanner part of  Lexmark  X1100/X1200
       AIOs. This backend should be considered beta-quality software!

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           status
              ----------------------  -----------
                Lexmark X74             good
                Lexmark X1110           untested
                Lexmark X1140           untested
                Lexmark X1150           good
                Lexmark X1170           good
                Lexmark X1180           good
                Lexmark X1185           complete
                Lexmark X12xx           good in USB1.1,
                               not fully tested in USB2.0
                Dell    A920            good

       The  options  the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       If you have any strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer
       or to the SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d lexmark:usb:&lt;usb port&gt;


       Scan Mode Options


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner  valid  choices
              are Color, Gray and Lineart The default mode is Color. The Lineart
              mode is black and white only (1 bit).  Grayscale will produce  256
              levels  of  gray  (8  bits). Color mode allows for over 16 million
              different colors produced from 24 bits of color information.


       --resolution
              selects the resolution for a scan.  The  horizontal  and  vertical
              resolutions  are  set  by the value of this option. The scanner is
              capable of the following  resolutions  for  the  specified  option
              value:

                Value   Hor. Resolution  Vert. Resolution
                -----   ---------------  -------------------
                75      75dpi            75dpi
                150     150dpi           150dpi
                300     300dpi           300dpi
                600     600dpi           600dpi
                1200    600dpi           1200dpi  (only for X11xx models with &apos;B2&apos; sensor)


       --preview
              requests  a  preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 75
              dpi and the scan area and the scan mode are as  specified  through
              their  options, or the default if not specified. The default value
              for preview mode is &quot;no&quot;.


       --threshold
              selects the  minimum-brightness to get a white point. The  thresh&#8208;
              old  is  only  used with Lineart mode scans.  It is specified as a
              percentage in the range 0..100% (in  steps  of  1).   The  default
              value of the threshold option is 50.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file  /etc/sane.d/lexmark.conf  contains only the usb
       device id (eg usb 0x043d 0x007c).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-lexmark.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-lexmark.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_LEXMARK
              SANE_DEBUG_LEXMARK_LOW If the library was compiled with debug sup&#8208;
              port enabled, this environment variable controls the  debug  level
              for  this  backend. E.g., a value of 255 requests all debug output
              to be printed. Smaller levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than  this  SANE  backend.
       However  they are only software adjustments. This backend only implements
       what the scanner can support. For instance, shading correction  (vertical
       stripes  due  to  sensor variation across its width) is done in software.
       Head park position is also detected by software.   The  data  compression
       isn&apos;t supported for the X1200 serie on USB 1.1, leading to slow scans.


BUGS
       No bugs currently known.
