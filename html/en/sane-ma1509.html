sane-ma1509(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-ma1509(5)



NAME
       sane-ma1509 - SANE backend for Mustek BearPaw 1200F USB scanner

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-ma1509 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to the Mustek BearPaw 1200F USB flatbed scanner.
       This  scanner  is  based  on the MA-1509 chipset. Other scanners that use
       this chip (if they exist) may also work.

       This backend is ALPHA software.  Be careful and  remove  the  power  plug
       immediately if your hear unusual noises.

       More   details   can   be   found   on   the   ma1509   backend  homepage
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/ma1509-backend/.

       Other Mustek USB scanners are supported by the gt68xx, mustek_usb and the
       plustek  backends.  See sane-mustek_usb(5), sane-gt68xx(5) and sane-plus&#8208;
       tek(5) for details.

       This backend can only work with scanners that are already detected by the
       operating system. See sane-usb(5) for details.

       If  you own a scanner other than the Mustek BearPaw 1200F that works with
       this backend, please let me know this  by  sending  the  scanner&apos;s  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices or syslog) to me.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is a path-name for the special device that corresponds to a
       USB  scanner.   With Linux, such a device name could be /dev/usb/scanner0
       or libusb:001:002, for example.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the ma1509.conf file is a  list  of  options  and  device
       names  that correspond to Mustek BearPaw 1200F scanners.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       Instead of using the device name, the scanner can be autodetected by  usb
       vendor_id   product_id   statements   which  are  already  included  into
       ma1509.conf.  This is only supported with Linux 2.4.8 and higher and  all
       systems that support libsub. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal
       numbers that identify the scanner. If this doesn&apos;t work,  a  device  name
       must be placed in ma1509.conf as described above.

       To  set  the  time  the lamp needs for warm-up, use option warmup-time in
       ma1509.conf.  The time is given in seconds after the option. The  default
       is 30 seconds.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/ma1509.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-ma1509.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-ma1509.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MA1509
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.
