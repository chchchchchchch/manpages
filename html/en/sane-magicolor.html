sane-magicolor(5)         SANE Scanner Access Now Easy         sane-magicolor(5)



NAME
       sane-magicolor - SANE backend for KONICA MINOLTA magicolor scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-magicolor  backend  supports  KONICA MINOLTA magicolor scanners
       connected via USB or LAN. Currently, only the magicolor 1690MF device  is
       supported, no other devices with the same scanning protocol are known.

SUPPORTED DEVICES
       The following scanner should work with this backend:

       Device Details
       -----------------------------
       Vendor: KONICA MINOLTA
       Model: magicolor 1690MF


CONFIGURATION
       This  section decribes the backend&apos;s configuration file entries. The file
       is located at:

              /etc/sane.d/magicolor.conf

       For a proper setup, at least one of the following entries are needed:

              net autodiscovery
              net [IP ADDRESS] [DEVICE-ID]
              usb
              usb [VENDOR-ID] [DEVICE-ID]


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/magicolor.conf
              The backend configuration file

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-magicolor.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-magicolor.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in  directories  &quot;/tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR=127

              To  obtain  debug  messages from the backend, set this environment
              variable before calling your favorite frontend (e.g. xscanimage).

              Example: SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR=65 xscanimage

KNOWN BUGS AND RESTRICTIONS
       Large color scans may sometimes timeout due to unknown reasons (the scan&#8208;
       ner simply stops returning data)

       Cancelling large scans may lock up the scanner.
