NAME
       sane-matsushita - SANE backend for Panasonic KV-SS high speed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-matsushita  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to some Panasonic KV-SS high speed scanners.
       This backend is stable.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend:

                Product id
              --------------
                 KV-SS25
                 KV-SS25D
                 KV-SS55EX (*)
                 KV-S2025C (*)
                 KV-S2045C (*)
                 KV-S2065L (*)

       (*) WARNING: None of the advanced options of these scanners are available
       (ie no color, no high resolution, no automatic cropping). Basically,  the
       driver  does  no  more  than  what  it does for the KV-SS25. I don&apos;t have
       access to such scanners, and thus cannot add these options.

       Other Panasonic high speed scanners may or may not work with  that  back&#8208;
       end.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d matsushita


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner.

       --resolution
              selects  the  resolution  for a scan. Each model supports all or a
              subset of these resolutions: 100, 150, 200, 240, 300, 360, 400.

       --duplex
              indicates whether to scan both side of the sheet.

       --feeder-mode
              selects the number of pages to scan (one  or  until  the  tray  is
              empty).


       Geometry


       --paper-size A4|...|Legal|Letter [A4]
              options  selects  the  area  to  scan.  It  adjust the -l -t -x -y
              options accordingly. It does not need to be the real size  of  the
              paper.


       -l -t -x -y
              control  the  scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the  height  of
              the  scan area. All parameters are specified in millimeters. It is
              possible to use the option --paper-size instead.


       Enhancement


       --brightness
              controls the brightness of the acquired image.  The  value  varies
              from 1 to 255, or less, depending on the scanner model.

       --contrast
              controls  the  contrast  of the acquired image. Some models do not
              support that option.

       --automatic-threshold
              automatically sets brightness, contrast, white level, gamma, noise
              reduction and image emphasis. These options are not available when
              automatic-threshold is in use.

       --halftone-pattern
              option sets the tonal gradation for  the  halftone  mode.  Pattern
              downloading is not implemented by the backend.

       --autoseparation
              provides automatic separation of text and images.

       --white-level
              option indicate the source of the white base.

       --noise-reduction
              reduces  the  isolated  dot noise. This option is not supported by
              all scanners.

       --image-emphasis
              option sets the image emphasis. Some selection are  not  available
              on all scanners.

       --gamma
              options  set the gamma curve. It is only valid for Gray modes, and
              is not available on all scanners. Gamma downloading is not  imple&#8208;
              mented by the backend.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file  /etc/sane.d/matsushita.conf supports the device
       name to use (eg /dev/scanner) and the  SCSI  option  to  auto-detect  the
       scanners supported.



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-matsushita.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-matsushita.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_MATSUSHITA
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       Memory in the KV-SS 25
              The  KV-SS  25  has  not enough internal memory to scan a whole A4
              page in duplex mode at high resolution. The frontend will return a
              memory  error in that case. Apparently, the KV-SS 25D has not that
              problem.

       Pattern and gamma downloading
              The scanner, with the proper firmware,  can  download  a  halftone
              pattern and a gamma table. This is not implemented.

       Sub-areas
              The  scanner  can support up to 3 sub-areas on each side to define
              some more precise enhancement options. This is not implemented.

       Duplex mode
              The backend does not support the setting of different options  for
              each  side.  The  scan  will occur with the same options (halftone
              pattern, brightness, image emphasis) for both sides.



SCANNING EXAMPLE
       To date, the only frontend capable of using this scanner at full speed is
       scanadf.

       A scanadf command line would be:

       scanadf -d matsushita --output-file scan%04d.pbm --start-count 0 --duplex
       --resolution 300 --feeder-mode=&quot;All pages&quot; --paper-size=&quot;A4&quot;



BUGS
       None known.
