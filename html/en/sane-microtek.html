NAME
       sane-microtek - SANE backend for Microtek scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-microtek  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the &quot;second  generation&quot;  Microtek  scan&#8208;
       ners.   At  present,  the  following  hardware is known to work with this
       backend:

              Microtek ScanMaker E2, E3, E6
              Microtek ScanMaker II, IIG, IIHR, IISP, III
              Microtek ScanMaker 35t, 35t+, 45t
              Microtek ScanMaker 600GS, 600ZS (see bug notes)
              Agfa StudioScan
              Agfa StudioScan II, StudioScan IIsi
              Agfa Arcus II (but not the &quot;Arcus&quot;)
              Agfa DuoScan (preliminary)
              Vobis &quot;Highscreen Realscan&quot;
              Microtek Color PageWiz (preliminary)

              Transparent Media Adapter
              Document AutoFeeder

       The driver supports line art, halftone, 8bpp gray, and 24bpp color  scans
       at  normal  and  &quot;expanded&quot;  resolutions  (i.e. 1200x1200 on an E6), fast
       scans for color previews, and downloadable gamma tables.

       The supported scanners are all SCSI  scanners.   However,  some  parallel
       port models may work (under Linux), if they use a parport-&gt;scsi chip, and
       if you can find a scsi-&gt;parport driver.  This is known to be the case for
       the Color PageWiz.

       The  driver  does  not  support the newest Microtek scanners, such as the
       V330 and V660, which use a new and very different  SCSI-II  command  set.
       For  those,  try the alternate microtek2 backend.  Most non-SCSI scanners
       would use the new command set.  Most scanners newer than the Scanmaker E6
       would use the new command set.

       If  you  own a Microtek scanner other than the ones listed above, tell us
       what happens --- see the BUGS section at the end of this document.

       Although this manual page is generally updated with each release,  up-to-
       date  information on new releases and extraneous helpful hints are avail&#8208;
       able from the backend homepage:
              http://www.mir.com/mtek/


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special  device  that  corre&#8208;
       sponds  to  the  scanner.  The special device name must be a generic SCSI
       device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such  a  device  name
       could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of  the  microtek.conf file is a list of device names that
       correspond to Microtek scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting  with  a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:
&#12;              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

       The  configuration  file may also contain the special tokens norealcal or
       noprecal.  norealcal will disable the use of magic, undocumented  scanner
       calibration  commands which are known to work on the E6, but may not work
       with other models.  noprecal will disable  logic  which  tries  to  avoid
       scanner precalibration.  This logic would only have been activated if the
       magic calibration code was turned off.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/microtek.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-microtek.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-microtek.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK
              If the library was compiled with debugging support  enabled,  this
              environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  A
              value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller lev&#8208;
              els reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Known bugs/limitations are:

              Brightness and contrast broken.
              The 600GS is grayscale only, and will lock up if you select color.
              (Unfortunately, the 600GS and 600ZS are indistinguishable by soft&#8208;
              ware.)

       i.e.  don&apos;t complain about these --- but if brightness and/or contrast do
       work for you, please tell me.

       If your scanner locks up, try setting the norealcal or noprecal option in
       the  configuration file (first one, then both), and see if it helps.  (If
       it does, report it.)

       Send   lengthy   bug   reports   and   new   scanner    information    to
       mtek-bugs@mir.com.   All  bug  reports  and  new scanner inquiries should
       include an error log file.  You can generate  copious  stderr  output  by
       setting  the  SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK  environment  variable described above.
       For example:

              setenv SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK 128
