NAME
       sane-mustek_pp - SANE backend for Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-mustek_pp  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners and
       OEM versions.

       There  are  2 classes of Mustek parallel port scanners: regular CCD (cold
       cathode device) scanners and CIS (contact image sensor) scanners.

       The current version of this backend supports both CCD type  scanners  and
       CIS type scanners.

       The following scanners might work with this backend:

       (*)    Calibration  problems existed with earlier version of this driver.
              They seem to be solved now.

       (**)   Problems have been reported in the past  for  the  MD/LT9850  type
              (striped  scans,  head  moving  in wrong direction at some resolu&#8208;
              tions). It is not known whether the current version of the  driver
              still has these problems.

       IF YOU HEAR LOUD CLICKING NOISES, IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE SCANNER !  (This
       holds for any type of scanner).

       (***)  Possibly, the engine_delay parameter has to be set  to  1  ms  for
              accurate engine movements.

       Please note that this backend is still under construction. Certain models
       are currently not supported and some may never be because the  communica&#8208;
       tion protocol is still unknown (eg., SE 12000 P).

       Some  scanners  work faster when EPP/ECP is enabled in the BIOS. EPP mode
       however may lead to hard-locks on some Linux systems. If that is the case
       for you, you can either disable ECP/EPP in your BIOS or disable it in the
       backend itself (see GLOBAL OPTIONS).

       Note that the backend needs to run as root or  has  to  have  appropriate
       access  rights to /dev/parport* if libieee1284 support is compiled in. To
       allow user access to the scanner run  the  backend  through  the  network
       interface (See saned(8) and sane-net(5)). Note also that the backend does
       not support parport sharing, i.e. if you  try  printing  while  scanning,
       your  computer  may  crash. To enable parport sharing, you have to enable
       libieee1284 at  compile  time.  This  backend  also  conflicts  with  the
       sane-musteka4s2  backend.  You  can  only  enable  one  of  them  in your
       dll.conf. However, you have to enable  the  backend  explicitly  in  your
       dll.conf, just remove the hash mark in the line &quot;mustek_pp&quot;.


DEVICE DEFINITION
       This backend allows multiple devices being defined and configured via the
       mustek_pp.conf file (even simultaneously, provided  that  they  are  con&#8208;
       nected  to  different parallel ports). Please make sure to edit this file
       before you use the backend.

       A device can be defined as follows:

              scanner &lt;name&gt; &lt;port name&gt; &lt;driver&gt;

       where

       &lt;name&gt; is an arbitrary name for the device, optionally enclosed by double
              quotes, for instance &quot;LifeTec 9350&quot;.

       &lt;port  name&gt; is the name of the parallel port to which the device is con&#8208;
              nected. In case libieee1284 is used  for  communication  with  the
              port (default setup), valid port names are parport0, parport1, and
              parport2.

       In case the backend is configured for raw IO (old setup), port  addresses
       have  to be used instead of port names: 0x378, 0x278, or 0x3BC.  The map&#8208;
       ping of parallel ports (lp0, lp1, and lp2) to these addresses can be dif&#8208;
       ferent  for  different  Linux  kernel  versions. For instance, if you are
       using a Kernel 2.2.x or better and you have only one parallel port,  this
       port  is  named lp0 regardless of the base address. However, this backend
       requires the base address of your port. If you are not  sure  which  port
       your  scanner  is  connected  to,  have a look at your /etc/conf.modules,
       /etc/modules.conf and/or /proc/ioports.

       If you are unsure which port to use, you can use the  magic  value  *  to
       probe for your scanner.

       &lt;driver&gt;  is the driver to use for this device. Currently available driv&#8208;
              ers are:

              cis600   : for 600 CP, 96 CP &amp; OEM versions
              cis1200  : for 1200 CP &amp; OEM versions
              cis1200+ : for 1200 CP+ &amp; OEM versions
              ccd300   : for 600 IIIE P &amp; OEM version

              Choosing the wrong driver can damage your scanner!
              Especially, using the 1200CP settings on a 600CP can  be  harmful.
              If the scanner starts making a loud noise, turn it off immediately
              !!!

       Using the cis600 driver on a 1200CP or a 1200CP+ is probably not  danger&#8208;
       ous. The cis1200+ driver also works for the 1200CP, and using the cis1200
       driver on a 1200CP+ will typically result in scans that cover  only  half
       of the width of the scan area (also not dangerous).

       If  unsure  about  the exact model of your OEM version, check the optical
       resolution in the manual or on the box: the 600CP has a  maximum  optical
       resolution  of 300x600 DPI, whereas the 1200CP and 1200CP+ have a maximum
       optical resolution of 600x1200 DPI.

       Examples:

              scanner &quot;LifeTec 9350&quot; 0x378 cis1200

              scanner Mustek_600CP 0x378 cis600

              scanner Mustek_600IIIEP * ccd300

       If in doubt which port you have  to  use,  or  whether  your  scanner  is
       detected at all, you can use sane-find-scanner -p to probe all configured
       ports.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the mustek_pp.conf file is a list of  device  definitions
       and  device  options that correspond to Mustek scanners.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Options have the follow&#8208;
       ing format:

              option &lt;name&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]

       Depending on the nature of the option, a value may or may not be present.
       Options always apply to the scanner definition that precedes them.  There
       are  no global options. Options are also driver-specific: not all drivers
       support all possible options.


   Common options
       bw &lt;value&gt;
              Black/white discrimination value to be used during  lineart  scan&#8208;
              ning.  Pixel values below this value are assumed to be black, val&#8208;
              ues above are assumed to be white.
              Default value: 127
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       255

              Example:  option bw 150


   CIS driver options
       top_adjust &lt;value&gt;
              Vertical adjustment of the origin, expressed in millimeter (float&#8208;
              ing  point).  This option can be used to calibrate the position of
              the origin, within certain limits.  Note  that  CIS  scanners  are
              probably  temperature sensitive, and that a certain inaccuracy may
              be hard to avoid. Differences in offset between runs in the  order
              of 1 to 2 mm are not unusual.
              Default value: 0.0
              Minimum:      -5.0
              Maximum:       5.0

              Example:  option top_adjust -2.5

       slow_skip
              Turns  fast skipping to the start of the scan region off. When the
              region to scan does not start at the origin, the driver  will  try
              to  move the scanhead to the start of the scan area at the fastest
              possible speed. On some models, this may not  work,  resulting  in
              large  inaccuracies  (up to centimeters).  By setting this option,
              the driver is forced to use normal speed  during  skipping,  which
              can circumvent the accuracy problems. Currently, there are no mod&#8208;
              els for which these inaccuracy problems are known to occur.

              By default, fast skipping is used.

              Example:  option slow_skip

       engine_delay &lt;value&gt;
              Under normal circumstances, it is sufficient  for  the  driver  to
              wait for the scanner signaling that the engine is stable, before a
              new engine command can be  transmitted.  In  rare  cases,  certain
              scanners  and/or parallel port chipsets appear to prevent reliable
              detection of the engine state. As a result,  engine  commands  are
              transmitted  too soon and the movement of the scanner head becomes
              unreliable. Inaccuracies ranging up to 10 cm over the whole verti&#8208;
              cal  scan  range  have been reported. To work around this problem,
              the engine_delay option can be set. If it is set, the driver waits
              an  additional amount of time after every engine command, equal to
              the engine_delay parameter, expressed in milliseconds. It practice
              an  engine_delay  of 1 ms is usually sufficient. The maximum delay
              is 100 ms.

              Note that every additional ms of delay can add up to 14 seconds to
              the  total  scanning  time (highest resolution), so an as small as
              possible value is preferred.

              Default value:   0
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       100

              Example:  option engine_delay 1


   CCD driver options
       top &lt;value&gt;
              Number of scanlines to skip to the start of  the  scan  area.  The
              number  can be any positive integer. Values known to me are 47 and
              56.

              Default value: 47
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option top 56

       waitbank &lt;value&gt;
              The number of usecs to wait for a  bank  change.  You  should  not
              touch this value actually. May be any positive integer

              Default value: 700
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option waitbank 700

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

       #
       # LifeTec/Medion 9350 on port 0x378
       #
       scanner &quot;LifeTec 9350&quot; 0x378 cis1200

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 127
       option top_skip -0.8

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       You  can control the overall behaviour of the mustek_pp backend by global
       options which precede any scanner definition in the mustek_pp.conf file.

       Currently, there is only one global option:


   Global options
       no_epp Disable parallel port mode EPP: works around a known  bug  in  the
              Linux  parport code. Enable this option, if the backend hangs when
              trying to access the parallel port in EPP mode.

              Default value: use EPP

              Example:  option no_epp


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

              level   debug output
              --------------------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings &amp; minor errors
               3      additional information
               4      debug information
               5      code flow (not supported yet)
               6      special debug information


       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2
              This  variable sets the debug level for the SANE interface for the
              Mustek chipset A4S2. Note that enabling this will spam your termi&#8208;
              nal with some million lines of debug output.

              level   debug output
              ----------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings
               3      things nice to know

              get any output from  the  mustek_pp  backend,  make  sure  a  line
              &quot;mustek_pp&quot;  is  included into your /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  If your
              scanner isn&apos;t detected, make sure you&apos;ve defined  the  right  port
              address in your mustek_pp.conf.

       the name of your scanner/vendor
              also a worthy information. Please also include the optical resolu&#8208;
              tion and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the  man&#8208;
              ual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if  you  have comments about the documentation (what could be done
              better), or you think I should know something, please include it.

       some nice greetings
