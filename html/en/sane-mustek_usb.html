sane-mustek_usb(5)        SANE Scanner Access Now Easy        sane-mustek_usb(5)



NAME
       sane-mustek_usb - SANE backend for Mustek USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-mustek_usb  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Mustek USB flatbed scanners (including  a
       clone  from Trust).  At present, the following scanners are known to work
       more or less with this backend:

              Mustek 600 CU
              Mustek 1200 UB
              Mustek 1200 CU
              Mustek 1200 CU Plus
              Trust Compact Scan USB 19200

       More  details  can  be  found  on  the  Mustek   USB   backend   homepage
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb-backend/.

       The  Mustek  BearPaw  1200 and 2400 scanners are supported by the plustek
       backend. See sane-plustek(5) for details. The  Mustek  BearPaw  1200F  is
       supported  by  the MA-1509 backend. See sane-ma1509(5) for details. Other
       Mustek  USB  scanners  are  supported  by   the   gt68xx   backend,   see
       sane-gt68xx(5).

       This backend can only work with scanners that are already detected by the
       operating system. See sane-usb(5) for details.

       If you own a Mustek (or Trust) scanner other than the ones  listed  above
       that  works  with  this  backend,  please let me know this by sending the
       scanner&apos;s exact model name and the USB vendor and device ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices or syslog) to me.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is a path-name for the special device that corresponds to a
       USB scanner.  With Linux, such a device name could  be  /dev/usb/scanner0
       or /dev/usbscanner1, for example.

       For FreeBSD use /dev/uscanner0.


CONFIGURATION
       The  contents of the mustek_usb.conf file is a list of options and device
       names that correspond to Mustek USB  scanners.   Empty  lines  and  lines
       starting  with a hash mark (#) are ignored. If a device name is placed in
       mustek_usb.conf, it must be followed by a  line  containing  the  keyword
       option  and  an option specifying the scanner type. The following options
       can be used: 600cu, 1200cu, 1200cu_plus, 1200ub.  For the  Trust  Compact
       Scan USB 19200 use `option 1200ub&apos;.

       Instead  of using the device name, the scanner can be autodetected by usb
       vendor_id  product_id  statements  which  are   already   included   into
       mustek_usb.conf.   This is only supported with Linux 2.4.8 and higher and
       all systems that support libsub. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot;  are  hexa&#8208;
       decimal numbers that identify the scanner. If this doesn&apos;t work, a device
       name and the option  specifying  the  scanner  type  must  be  placed  in
       mustek_usb.conf as described above.
&#12;       The  global option max_block_size can be used to limit the amount of data
       acquired in one turn from the USB system. It may be worth trying, if  USB
       errors occur.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              # Comment
              option max_block_size 1024
              usb 0x055f 0x0001
              /dev/usb/scanner0
              option 600cu

       The first line is ignored. The second line sets the buffer size to a max&#8208;
       imum of 1024 bytes.  The third line tries to autodetect  a  scanner  with
       vendor  id 0x055f and product id 0x0001 (Mustek 1200 CU). The fourth line
       tells the backend to attach to /dev/usb/scanner0 and the fifth line spec&#8208;
       ifies that /dev/usb/scanner0 is a Mustek 600 CU.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/mustek_usb.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Value  Description
              0      no output
              1      print fatal errors
              2      print important messages
              3      print non-fatal errors and less important messages
              4      print all but debugging messages
              5      print high level debugging messages
              6      print medium level debugging messages
              7      print low level debugging messages

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB=4

AUTHOR
       Henning Meier-Geinitz &lt;henning@meier-geinitz.de&gt;
       This  backend  is  based  on the Mustek 1200ub backend from Mustek, main&#8208;
       tained by Tom Wang.


BUGS
       These devices have a hardware bug: Once data is  written  to  them,  they
       can&apos;t  be reset (toggle = DATA0). That means, any operation that tries to
       reset the device will result in running into timeouts.

       In earlier versions this backend failed when it  was  loaded  the  second
       time in some configurations. The only choice was to replug the scanner in
       this case. The backend uses a workaround for that bug now but  it&apos;s  only
       tested on Linux. Reports for other operating systems are appreciated.


       More detailed bug information is available at the Mustek backend homepage
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb-backend/.
