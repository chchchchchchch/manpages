NAME
       sane-mustek_usb2 - SANE backend for SQ113 based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-mustek_usb2 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to USB flatbed scanners based on the Service
       &amp;  Quality  SQ113 chipset. At the moment, only the Mustek BearPaw 2448 TA
       Pro is supported. It&apos;s planned to add support for other scanners that are
       based  on  the  SQ113  and  maybe  SQ11  chip.  For more details, see the
       mustek_usb2                       backend                       homepage:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb2-backend/.

       This  is  BETA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
       keep your hand at the scanner&apos;s plug and unplug it, if the head bumps  at
       the end of the scan area.

       If  you own a scanner other than the ones listed on the mustek_usb2 home&#8208;
       page that works with this backend, please let me know this by sending the
       scanner&apos;s  exact  model name and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
       sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner&apos;s  name  is  only
       slightly  different  from  the models already listed as supported, please
       let me know.

LIBUSB ISSUES
       Please use libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without libusb  or  with  older  libusb
       versions  all  kinds  of  trouble  can be expected. The scanner should be
       found by sane-find-scanner without further actions. For  setting  permis&#8208;
       sions and general USB information looks at sane-usb(5).

FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2=4

       ning@meier-geinitz.de&gt;.  Please  send  a  debug log if your scanner isn&apos;t
       detected correctly (see SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2 above).
