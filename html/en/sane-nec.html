NAME
       sane-nec - SANE backend for NEC scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-nec library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to NEC SCSI scanners.  This backend should  be  con&#8208;
       sidered alpha-quality software!  In the current state it is known to work
       with PC-IN500/4C scanners. Another MultiReader scanner series is not sup&#8208;
       ported.   PC-IN   500/4C   and  MultiReader  scanner  are  only  sold  in
       Japan.(except Multi Reader PetiScan.)

       For other scanners, it may or may not work.

       The backend has the following known problems:
              - ColorLineart mode is not supported.
              - device name is fixed to /dev/scanner

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend.
              Vendor Product id
              ------ -----------
              NEC    PC-IN500/4C


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/nec.conf
              The backend configuration file.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-nec.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-nec.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_NEC
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
