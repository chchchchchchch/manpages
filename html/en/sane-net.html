sane-net(5)               SANE Scanner Access Now Easy               sane-net(5)



NAME
       sane-net - SANE network backend

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-net library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to image acquisition devices through a network  con&#8208;
       nection.   This makes it possible to control devices attached to a remote
       host and also provides  a  means  to  grant  users  access  to  protected
       resources.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              host:device

       Where host is the name (or IP address) of the (remote) host and device is
       the name of the device on this host that should  be  addressed.   If  the
       device  name  does  not  contain  a  colon (:), then the entire string is
       treated as the device string for the default host.  The default  host  is
       the host listed last in the configuration file (see below).

       An IPv6 address can be specified enclosed in square brackets:

              [::1]:device

CONFIGURATION
       The  net.conf file contains both backend options and a list of host names
       (or IP addresses) that should be contacted for  scan  requests.  Anything
       that  isn&apos;t  one  of  the options listed below will be treated as an host
       name.

       connect_timeout = nsecs
              Timeout (in seconds) for  the  initial  connection  to  the  saned
              server.  This  will  prevent the backend from blocking for several
              minutes trying to connect to an unresponsive saned  host  (network
              outage, host down, ...). The environment variable SANE_NET_TIMEOUT
              can also be used to specify the timeout at runtime.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#)  are  ignored.   Note
       that  IPv6  addresses  in  this file do not need to be enclosed in square
       brackets.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              scan-server.somedomain.firm
              192.168.0.1
              # this is a comment
              localhost
              ::1

       The above list of hosts can be extended  at  run-time  using  environment
       variable  SANE_NET_HOSTS.  This environment variable is a colon-separated
       list of hostnames or IP addresses that should be contacted in addition to
       the hosts mentioned in the configuration file.  For example, a user could
       set the environment variable to the string:

              new.scanner.com:[::1]:192.168.0.2:scanner.univ.edu

       To request that hosts new.scanner.com , [::1]  ,  192.168.0.2  and  scan&#8208;
       ner.univ.edu are contacted in addition to the hosts listed above.

       For this backend to function properly, it is also necessary to define the
       sane-port service in /etc/services.  The sane service should  be  defined
       using a line of the following form:

              sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/net.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-net.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-net.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_NET_HOSTS
              A  colon-separated  list  of host names or IP addresses to be con&#8208;
              tacted by this backend.

       SANE_NET_TIMEOUT
              Number of seconds to wait for a response from the saned server for
              the initial connection request.

       SANE_DEBUG_NET
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       If saned has timed out, the  net  backend  may  loop  with  authorization
       requests.
