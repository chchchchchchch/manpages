sane-p5(5)                SANE Scanner Access Now Easy                sane-p5(5)



NAME
       sane-p5 - SANE backend for the Primax PagePartner

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-p5  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to the Primax PagePartner parallel  port  sheet  fed
       scanner.

       This  backend handles 100, 150, 200, 300 and 600 dpi scan resolutions, in
       color and gray modes. The 600 dpi is actually 300x600 with lines enlarged
       to match the vertical resolution.

       EPP/ECP  MODES  ONLY  The current version of the backend uses only EPP or
       ECP mode to communicate with the scanner. It is recommended that you  set
       your  parallel port to EPP in BIOS with the current version of this back&#8208;
       end. ECPEPP will only work if you use a 2.4  or  2.6  kernel  with  ppdev
       character device support.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port value

       Where value is :


              auto   autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for scanner

              /dev/parport0
                     uses  linux ppdev device, depending on the number of avail&#8208;
                     able  parallel  port,  you  have  to   use   /dev/parport1,
                     /dev/parport2, ...

       You can rename any device using the

              option name my_name

       option. This option apply to the last port option.


CONFIGURATION
       Please  make sure to edit dll.conf before you use the backend, since this
       backend isn&apos;t enabled by default.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/p5.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-p5.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-p5.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_P5
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a value of 255 requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


              level   debug output
              ------- ------------------------------
               0       critical errors
               1       errors
               2       warnings &amp; minor errors
               4       information messages
               8       start/stop of functions
               16      tracing messages
               32      I/O functions
               64      I/O functions with traces
               128     scanned/calibration data

BUG REPORTS
       If something doesn&apos;t work mail sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org or  use
       the                    bug                   tracker                   at
       https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=410366&amp;group_id=30186  .   Please
       give as much information as you can.


       SANE version
              run &quot;scanimage -V&quot; to determine this

       the backend version and your scanner hardware
              run  &quot;SANE_DEBUG_P5=255  scanimage -L 2&gt;log&quot; as root. If you don&apos;t
              get any output from the p5 backend,  make  sure  a  line  &quot;p5&quot;  is
              included  into  your  /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  If your scanner isn&apos;t
              detected, make sure you&apos;ve defined the right port address, or  the
              correct device in your p5.conf.

       the name of your scanner/vendor
              also a worthy information. Please also include the optical resolu&#8208;
              tion and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the  man&#8208;
              ual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if  you  have comments about the documentation (what could be done
              better), or you think I should know something, please include it.
