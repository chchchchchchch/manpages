NAME
       sane-qcam - SANE backend for Connectix QuickCam cameras

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-qcam library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access Connectix QuickCam cameras.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port

       Where port is the I/O port address at which  the  device  resides.   This
       address is normally specified in hexadecimal using C syntax (e.g., 0x37b)
       and may be prefixed with the letter &quot;u&quot; (e.g., u0x37b) to force the back&#8208;
       end to access the camera in uni-directional mode.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of the qcam.conf file is a list port addresses that may be
       connected to a Connectix QuickCam.  Empty lines and  everything  starting
       from  a hash mark (#) up to the end of a line are ignored.  A sample con&#8208;
       figuration file is shown below:

              0x37b  # /dev/lp0
              0x378  # /dev/lp1
              u0x278 # /dev/lp2 forced in uni-directional mode
              0x3bc  # /dev/lp0 (alternate address)

       In general, it is safest to list only the port addresses that really cor&#8208;
       respond to a QuickCam.  For example, if one of the listed addresses actu&#8208;
       ally connect to a printer, then starting up this backend will  cause  the
       printer to perform a device reset (which is generally undesirable).

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/qcam.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-qcam.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-qcam.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_QCAM
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Support is currently limited to the color version of the  QuickCam.   The
       black-and-white  camera  is  starting to work too, but I don&apos;t believe it
       works in all cases yet.  Reportedly, acquiring images  of  certain  sizes
       work fine, but others result in shifted images (sounds like a problem due
       to byte-padding).

       The program needs root-privileges since it needs to be able to access the
       camera&apos;s I/O ports.
