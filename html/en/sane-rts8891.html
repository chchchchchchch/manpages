NAME
       sane-rts8891 - SANE backend for rts8891 based scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-rts8891  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to scanners based on the rts8891 ASIC.

       The scanners that work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           status
              ----------------------  -----------
                Umax Astra 4400       untested
                Umax Astra 4450       untested
                HP scanjet 4000c      good
                HP scanjet 4470c      good

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       If you have any strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer
       or to the SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d rts8891


       Scan Mode Options


       --mode selects  the  basic mode of operation of the scanner valid choices
              are R Color , Gray and Lineart The default mode is Color. The Lin&#8208;
              eart mode is black and white only (1 bit).  Grayscale will produce
              256 levels of gray (8 bits). Color mode allows for over 16 million
              different colors produced from 24 bits of color information.


       --resolution
              selects  the  resolution  for  a scan. The horizontal and vertical
              resolutions are set by the value of this option.  The  scanner  is
              capable  of  the  following  resolutions  for the specified option
              value:

                Value   Hor. Resolution  Vert. Resolution
                -----   ---------------  -------------------
                75      75dpi            75dpi
                150     150dpi           150dpi
                300     300dpi           300dpi
                600     600dpi           600dpi
                1200    1200dpi          1200dpi


       --preview
              requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan  is  75
              dpi  and  the scan area and the scan mode are as specified through
              their options, or the default if not specified. The default  value
              for preview mode is &quot;no&quot;.


       --threshold
              selects  the  minimum-brightness to get a white point. The thresh&#8208;
              old is only used with Lineart mode scans.  It is  specified  as  a
              percentage  in  the  range  0..100%  (in steps of 1).  The default
              value of the threshold option is 50.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file /etc/sane.d/rts8891.conf contains the  usb  device
       ids  of  supported scanners (eg usb 0x043d 0x007c) and scanner configura&#8208;
       tion options.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are
       ignored.

       The options supported are allowsharing , modelnumber

       Option

       allowsharing  enables  or not the sharing of the scanner between multiple
       frontends at the same time.

       modelnumber is used to force the reported model by  the  backend  and  is
       only usefull in the case of a scanner which NVRAM has been erased.
              0 to report a HP4470c.
              1 to report a HP4400c.
              2 to report an Astra 4400.


FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-rts8891.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-rts8891.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_RTS8891 SANE_DEBUG_RTS8891_LOW SANE_DEBUG_RTS88XX_LIB
              If the library was compiled  with  debug  support  enabled,  these
              environment  variables  controls the debug level for this backend.
              E.g., a value of 255 requests all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       Scanners  of  the same model exist with different sensors, due to lack of
       data (ie USB logs) some sensors are  better  supported  than  others.  At
       least 75 dpi mode is working for any model. Sharing the a scanner between
       several frontends at the same time (allowsharing option) may not work  on
       some USB controllers.

       XPA is no (yet) supported.

BUGS
       No bugs currently known.
