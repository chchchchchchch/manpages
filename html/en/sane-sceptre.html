sane-sceptre(5)           SANE Scanner Access Now Easy           sane-sceptre(5)



NAME
       sane-sceptre - SANE backend for SCEPTRE scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-sceptre  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Sceptre flatbed  scanners.  This  backend
       should  be  considered  beta-quality  software! Please report any strange
       behavior to the maintainer of the backend or to the SANE mailing list.

       At present, only one scanner is known to work with this backend:

              Model                        Connection Type
              ---------------------------  -------------------
              Sceptre VividScan S1200      SCSI

       The make of this scanner is KINPO, so other scanners from  that  manufac&#8208;
       turer may also work (eg. the S600).

OPTIONS
       The  options  the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d sceptre


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects  the  basic mode of operation of the scanner valid choices
              are Lineart, Halftone, Gray and Color.  The Lineart  and  Halftone
              mode  are black and white only (1 bit). Gray will produce 256 lev&#8208;
              els of gray (8 bits). Color will produce a 24  bits  color  image.
              The scanner supports 30 bits internally but it only exports 24.


       --resolution
              selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do several res&#8208;
              olutions between 50 and 1200.


       --halftone-pattern
              selects the pattern mode that is  used  in  Halftone  mode.  Valid
              options are 1, 2, 3 and 4.


       --gamma-correction
              controls  the scanner internal gamma correction. Valid options are
              &quot;Default&quot;, &quot;User defined&quot;, &quot;High density  printing&quot;  &quot;Low  density
              printing&quot; and &quot;High contrast printing&quot;.


       --custom-gamma
              (color  mode  only)  allows the user to specify a gamma table (see
              the next 3 parameters).


       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.
&#12;
       --green-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --threshold
              sets  the  threshold  for  black and white pixels in lineart mode.
              Possible values are from 0 (darker) to 255 (lighter).


       --preview
              requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan  is  30
              dpi  and  the  scan  area is the maximum allowed. The scan mode is
              user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.


       The geometry options


       -l -t -x -y
              control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate,  -t  the
              top  left  y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area. All parameters  are  specified  in  millimeters  by
              default.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file /etc/sane.d/sceptre.conf supports only one infor&#8208;
       mation: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sceptre.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sceptre.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SCEPTRE
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       Resolutions
              The windows TWAIN driver can be set to any resolution  between  50
              to  1200  (excluding software interpolation). This backend cannot.
              Only a handful of resolution are available, although  they  should
              be numerous enough.
&#12;
BUGS
       None known.
