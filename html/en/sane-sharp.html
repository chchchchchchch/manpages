sane-sharp(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-sharp(5)



NAME
       sane-sharp - SANE backend for SHARP scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-sharp library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to Sharp SCSI scanners.  This backend should  be
       considered  beta-quality  software!   In the current state it is known to
       work with JX-610 and JX-250 scanners. It is prepared for usage  with  the
       JX-330  series  scanners,  but  we  are  not  able  to test it with these
       devices.

       For other Sharp scanners, it may or may not work.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend.

              Vendor  Product id:
              -----   -----------
              Sharp   JX-610
              Sharp   JX-250
              Sharp   JX-320
              Sharp   JX-330
              Sharp   JX-350

       The following scanners are detected by the backend, but not tested:

              Vendor  Product id:
              -----   -----------
              Sharp   JX-325

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is either the path-name for the special device that  corre&#8208;
       sponds  to a SCSI scanner. The special device name must be a generic SCSI
       device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such  a  device  name
       could  be  /dev/sga  or  /dev/sge,  for  example.   See  sane-scsi(5) for
       details.


SCAN OPTIONS
       Scan Mode (parameter --mode for scanimage). Possible settings:
              Lineart (1 bit black &amp; white scans),
              Gray (8 bit gray scale scans),
              Lineart Color (bi-level color scans),
              Color (8 bit RGB scans).
       The default value is Color.

       Halftone Pattern (parameter --halftone-pattern for scanimage).  Available
       only for the JX-330 series scanners.  Possible settings:
              none
              Dither Bayer
              Dither Spiral
              Dither Dispersed
              Error Diffusion
       The default value is none.

       Paper  Source  (parameter  --source  for  scanimage). This option is only
       available, if an automatic document feeder or a transparency  adapter  is
       installed. Possible settings:
              Flatbed
              Automatic Document Feeder
              Transparency Adapter
       If an ADF or a transparency adapter is installed, using it is the default
       selection.

       Custom Gamma (parameter --custom-gamma for scanimage). This option deter&#8208;
       mines  whether  a  builtin or a custom gamma-table is used. Possible set&#8208;
       tings:
              yes enables custom gamma tables
              no enables a built gamma table

       Gamma (parameter --Gamma for scanimage). This option is  only  available,
       if Custom Gamma is set to no.  Possible values:
              1.0
              2.2
       The  default  value is 2.2. (The JX-250 and JX-350 have no built in gamma
       correction; for these scanner, a gamma table is downloaded to the scanner
       by the backend.)

       Gamma  Table  (parameter  --gamma-table  for  scanimage). Allowed values:
       0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are 0, 1, 2,  ..
       255 (i.e., gamma == 1). This table is only used for gray scale scans.

       Red Gamma Table (parameter --red-gamma-table for scanimage). Allowed val&#8208;
       ues: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values are  0,  1,
       2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       Green  Gamma  Table (paramter --green-gamma-table for scanimage). Allowed
       values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values  are  0,
       1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       Blue  Gamma  Table  (paramter  --blue-gamma-table for scanimage). Allowed
       values: 0..255; 256 numbers must be defined.  The default values  are  0,
       1, 2, .. 255 (i.e., gamma == 1).

       Resolution  in  pixel  per  inch  (parameter --resolution for scanimage).
       Selects the resolution of the scanned image. Allowed values:
              30..600 (JX-330, JX-350 and JX-610) resp.  30..400 (JX-250)
       The default value is 150.

       Scan Window

       The possible settings depend on the scanner model and, for the JX-250 and
       the  JX-350, also on the usage of the automatic document feeder resp. the
       transparency adapter. Please refer to the values allowed  by  xscanimage,
       or xsane. With scanimage, enter one of the following commands:

              scanimage -d sharp --source &quot;Automatic Document Feeder&quot; --help

              scanimage -d sharp --source Flatbed --help

              scanimage -d sharp --source &quot;Transparency Adapter&quot; --help

       in order to see the allowed parameter values for the scan window.

       The scan window parameters are:

              Top-left x position of scan area (parameter -l for scanimage);
              Top-left y position of scan area (parameter -t for scanimage);
              bottom right x position of scan area (parameter -x for scanimage);
              bottom right y position of scan area (parameter -y for scanimage);

       Edge  emphasis  (parameter --Edge emphasis for scanimage). This option is
       not available for the JX-250 and the JX-350.  Possible settings:
              None
              Middle
              Strong
              Blur
       The default value is None.

       Threshold (parameter --threshold for scanimage). Sets the  threshold  for
       black and white pixels in lineart mode. Possible values:
              1..255
       The  default  value  is  128.  This option is only available in scan mode
       lineart.

       Threshold Red (parameter --threshold-red for scanimage). Sets the thresh&#8208;
       old  for the red component of a pixel in in lineart color scan mode. Pos&#8208;
       sible values:
              1..255

       The default value is white.  This option is only available in scan  modes
       lineart color and color.


ADF USAGE
       If a paper jam occurred, the maintenance cover must be opened and closed,
       even if the jammed paper can be removed without opening  the  maintenance
       cover. Otherwise, the error condition cannot be cleared.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the sharp.conf file is a list of options and device names
       that correspond to Sharp scanners. Empty lines and lines beginning with a
       hash  mark  (#)  are  ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) for details about device
       names.

       Lines setting an option start with the key word option, followed  by  the
       option&apos;s  name  and  the  option&apos;s  value.  At present, three options are
       defined: buffers, buffersize, and readqueue.

       Options defined at the start of sharp.conf apply to all devices;  options
       defined after a device name apply to this device.

       The options buffers and readqueue are only significant if the backend has
       been compiled so that for each scan a second process  is  forked  (switch
       USE_FORK  in sharp.c ). This process reads the scan data from the scanner
       and writes this data into a block of shared memory.  The  parent  process
       reads  the  data  from this memory block and delivers it to the frontend.
       The options control the size and usage of this shared memory block.

       option buffers defines the number of buffers used.  The  smallest  number
       allowed is 2.

       option  buffersize  defines  the size of one buffer. Since each buffer is
       filled with a single read command sent to the scanner, its size  is  lim&#8208;
       ited  automatically to the size allowed by the operating system or by the
       Sane SCSI library for SCSI read commands. A buffer size of 128 kB or  256
       kB is recommended for scan resolutions of 300 dpi and above.

       option readqueue defines how many read commands to be sent to the scanner
       are queued. At present, the Sane SCSI library supports queued  read  com&#8208;
       mands  only  for for Linux. For other operating systems, option readqueue
       should be set to 0. For Linux, option  readqueue  should  be  set  to  2.
       Larger  values  than  2  for  option readqueue are not reasonable in most
       cases.  option buffers should be greater than option readqueue.


Performance Considerations
       This section focuses on the problem of stops of  the  scanner&apos;s  carriage
       during a scan. Carriage stops happen mainly with the JX-250. This scanner
       has obviously only a small internal buffer compared to  its  speed.  That
       means  that  the  backend must read the data as fast as possible from the
       scanner in order to avoid carriage stops.

       Even the JX-250 needs only less than 10 seconds for a  400  dpi  A4  gray
       scale scan, which results in a data transfer rate of more than 1.6 MB per
       second. This means that the data produced by the  scanner  must  be  pro&#8208;
       cessed  fairly  fast. Due to the small internal buffer of the JX-250, the
       backend must issue a read request for the next data block as soon as pos&#8208;
       sible after reading a block of data in order to avoid carriage stops.

       Stops of the carriage can be caused by the following reasons:

              - too much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI bus
              - slow responses by the backend to the scanner,
              -  a  program which processes the data acquired by the backend too
              slow.

       Too much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI bus: This happens  for  example,  if  hard
       disks  are  connected  to the same SCSI bus as the scanner, and when data
       transfer from/to these hard disks requires a  considerable  part  of  the
       SCSI bandwidth during a scan. If this is the case, you should consider to
       connect the scanner to a separate SCSI adapter.

       Slow responses by the backend to the  scanner:  Unfortunately,  Unix-like
       operating  systems  generally have no real time capabilities.  Thus there
       is no guarantee that the backend is under any circumstances able to  com&#8208;
       municate  with the scanner as fast as required. To minimize this problem,
       the backend should be compiled so  that  a  separate  reader  process  is
       forked:  Make sure that USE_FORK is defined when you compile sharp.c.  If
       slow responses of the backend remain to be  problem,  you  could  try  to
       reduce  the  load  of  the  system. Even while the backend and the reader
       process need only a minor amount of processor time,  other  running  pro&#8208;
       cesses  can  cause  an increase in the time delay between two time slices
       given to the reader process. On slower systems, such an  increased  delay
       can  be  enough to cause a carriage stop with the JX-250.  For Linux, the
       usage of the SG driver version 2.1.36 or above is recommended, because it
       supports,  in  combination  with  the SCSI library of Sane version 1.0.2,
       command queueing within the kernel.  This queueing  implementation,  com&#8208;
       bined  with  a buffer size of at least 128 kB, should avoid most carriage
       stops.

       Slow processing of the scan data: An example for this  situation  is  the
       access  to  the  scanner  via a 10 MBit Ethernet, which is definitely too
       slow to transfer the scan data as fast as they are produced by the  scan&#8208;
       ner.  If  you  have enough memory available, you can increase option buf&#8208;
       fers, so that an entire image can be stored in these buffers.

       In order to see, if the backend is too slow or if the further  processing
       of the data is too slow, set the environment variable SANE_DEBUG_SHARP to
       1. When a scan is finished, the backend writes the line &quot;buffer full con&#8208;
       ditions:  nn&quot;  to stderr. If nn is zero, carriage stops are caused by too
       slow responses of the backend or too much &quot;traffic&quot; on the SCSI  bus.  If
       nn  is greater than zero, the backend had to wait nn times until a buffer
       has been processed by the frontend. (Please note that option buffers must
       be  greater than option readqueue in order to get useful output for &quot;buf&#8208;
       fer full conditions&quot;.)


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/sharp.conf
              The backend configuration file.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sharp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sharp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SHARP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
       1. ADF Mode
              After several ADF scans, the scanner moves the  carriage  back  to
              the  idle  position  and  back to ADF scan position, before a scan
              starts. We do not know, if this is a problem of the scanner, or if
              this  is  a bug of the backend. At present, the scanner must power
              off and on to stop this annoying behaviour.

       2. Threshold level does not work (only JX-610)

       3. The maximum resolution is limited to 600 dpi(JX-610 supported to  1200
       dpi) resp. 400 dpi (JX-250)

       4.  If  the JX250 is used with an ADF, the following situation can occur:
       After several scans, the scanner moves, after  loading  a  new  sheet  of
       paper,  the  carriage to the idle position, and then back to the position
       used for ADF scans. This happens for every scan, in contrast to the cali&#8208;
       bration, which is done after 10 scans. (For the calibration, the carriage
       is also moved to the idle position.) We do not know, if this behavior  is
       caused by the backend, or if it is a bug in the firmware of the scanner.

       5. Usage of a transparency adapter (film scan unit) is supported, but not
       tested.
