sane-sm3600(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-sm3600(5)



NAME
       sane-sm3600 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners with M011 USB chip

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-sm3600 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some Microtek scanners with the Toshiba  M011
       custom USB chip.  This backend should be considered alpha.

       There  are  also  backends  for  Microtek scanners with SCSI command set.
       Refer to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5) for details.

       At present, the following scanners are known positively to work with this
       backend:

              Vendor     Product id:     Remark:
              --------   --------------  -----------
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3600  all modes ok
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3700  reported to work
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3750  reported to work

       If  you  own  a  Microtek  scanner with the M011 chip other than the ones
       listed above, it may or may not work with SANE!


FRONTEND OPTIONS
       This backend dynamically enables the options for the frontend,  that  are
       supported  by  the  scanner  in dependence of the scanning-mode and other
       options. Not supported options are disabled.

       The following options are supported by the Microtek2-driver:

       Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.

       contrast, brightness, control, gamma correction.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend does not support device names in a standardized form.


CONFIGURATION
       This backend does not support a configuration file right now.


FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sm3600.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sm3600.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SM3600
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity. To  see  error  messages  on  stderr  set
              SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 to 1.

              E.g. just say:
              export SANE_DEBUG_SM3600=5
