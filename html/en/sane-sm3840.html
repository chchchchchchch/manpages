sane-sm3840(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-sm3840(5)



NAME
       sane-sm3840 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners with SCAN08 USB chip

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-sm3840 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some Microtek scanners with  the  SCAN08  USB
       chip.

       There  exist backends for Microtek scanners with SCSI command set.  Refer
       to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5) for details.

       There also exists a Microtek 3600 series driver, see  sane-sm3600(5)  for
       details.

       At present, the following scanners are known positively to work with this
       backend:

              Vendor     Product ID:     Remark:
              --------   --------------  -----------
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3840  All modes OK
              Microtek   ScanMaker 4800  All modes OK

       If you own a Microtek scanner with the SCAN08 chip other  than  the  ones
       listed above, it may or may not work with SANE.  Feel free to contact the
       backend author (earle@ziplabel.com) to report results with  scanners  not
       on the list.



FRONTEND OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by the sm3840-driver:

       --mode color|gray|lineart|halftone
       Color or grayscale mode.

       --resolution 150|300|600|1200
       Pixels per inch for scans.

       --depth 8|16
       Note that the least significant bits of 16bpp mode may be noise.

       --brightness 1..4096
       Higher numbers increase brightness of returned image.

       --contrast 0.1..9.9
       Larger numbers decrease contrast of returned image.

       --lamp-timeout 1..15
       Time in minutes until the lamp is turned off after a scan.


CONFIGURATION
       This backend does not support a configuration file right now.


FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sm3840.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-sm3840.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SM3840
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels  reduce  verbosity.  To  see  error  messages on stderr set
              SANE_DEBUG_SM3840 to 1.
