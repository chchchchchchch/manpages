NAME
       sane-snapscan - SANE backend for AGFA SnapScan flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-snapscan  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides  access  to  AGFA  SnapScan  flatbed  scanners.  At
       present,  the  following  scanners  are supported from this backend: AGFA
       SnapScan 300, 310, 600, and 1236s, 1236u, 1212u, e20, e25, e40, e50, e60,
       Vuego 310s, Acer 300f, 310s, 610s, 610plus, Prisa 620s, Prisa 620u, Prisa
       620ut, Prisa 640u, Prisa 640bu, Prisa 1240, Prisa 3300, Prisa 4300, Prisa
       5300 and Guillemot Maxi Scan A4 Deluxe (SCSI) (with varying success).

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that corresponds to
       a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the special  device  name  must  be  a
       generic  SCSI  device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a
       device name could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example.  See sane-scsi(5)
       for details.

       For  USB  scanners  the  devicename must contain the keyword &quot;usb&quot;, as in
       /dev/usbscanner or /dev/usb/scanner0.  For scanners that need a  firmware
       upload  before  scanning  add a line starting with &quot;firmware&quot; followed by
       the fully qualified path to your firmware file, e.g.

              firmware /usr/share/sane/snapscan/firmware.bin

       For further details read http://snapscan.sourceforge.net.


CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the snapscan.conf file is a list  of  device  names  that
       correspond  to  SnapScan scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of  what  consti&#8208;
       tutes a valid device name.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/snapscan.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-snapscan.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-snapscan.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_SNAPSCAN
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of 255 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.
