NAME
       sane-sp15c - SANE backend for Fujitsu ScanPartner 15C flatbed scanner


DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-sp15c library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end which provides access to the Fujitsu flatbed scanners.   At  present,
       the following scanner is known to work with these backend:

              Vendor:  Model:           Rev:
              -------- ---------------- -----
              FCPA     ScanPartner 15C  1.01

       The  ScanPartner  15C  driver supports lineart (1-bit), halftone (1-bit),
       grayscale (4-bit and 8-bit), and color (3 x 8-bit) scanning.

       Other scanners in these families may work.  The ScanPartner 15C seems  to
       be  a  repackaging of the ScanPartner 600C.  People are encouraged to try
       these driver with the other scanners and to contact the author with  test
       results.


CONFIGURATION
       A  modest effort has been made to expose the standard options to the API.
       This allows frontends such as xscanimage to set scanning region,  resolu&#8208;
       tion, bit-depth (and color), and enable the automatic document feeder.

       author of the coolscan driver


LIMITATIONS
       Testing limited to a Linux 2.2.5 kernel
       Can&apos;t quite get the scan page/minute performance in ADF modes.  This  may
       be due to limited system buffer size.


BUGS
       I&apos;m  sure  there  are plenty, and not too well hidden, but I haven&apos;t seen
       them yet.
       Both scanners claim to have separate control of resolution  in  X  and  Y
       directions.   I  confess  I  haven&apos;t  tested this yet.  I have found that
       xsane doesn&apos;t even display this capability.
       Threshold settings on the SP15C don&apos;t seem to affect the results of  lin&#8208;
       eart mode scans.
       It might be possible to merge these two drivers without much effort since
       the SP15C driver was derived from the M3096G driver.  They were split  so
       as  to keep the second driver development from breaking the working first
       driver.  Watch this space for changes.
