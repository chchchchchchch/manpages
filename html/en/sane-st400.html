NAME
       sane-st400 - SANE backend for Siemens ST/Highscan flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-st400 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to Siemens ST400 flatbed scanners  and  compati&#8208;
       bles.  At present, the following scanners are supported by this backend:

              Siemens ST400 (6 bit gray scale)
              Siemens ST800 (6 bit gray scale)

       The driver supports line art and gray scans up to 8bpp.

       The  Siemens  ST/Highscan  series  includes several more models, e.g. the
       ST300 and ST600.  If you own one of these scanners, or  a  scanner  other
       than  the  ones  listed above that works with this backend, please let us
       know by sending the scanner&apos;s model name, SCSI ID, and firmware  revision
       to     sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.      Have     a     look    at
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html concerning subscription to
       sane-devel.


DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special is either the path-name for the special device that corre&#8208;
       sponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the special device name must
       be  a  generic  SCSI  device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux,
       such a device name could be  /dev/sga  or  /dev/sge,  for  example.   See
       sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the st400.conf file is a list of device names that corre&#8208;
       spond to Siemens scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting  with  a  hash
       mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

       The  default  configuration file that is distributed with SANE looks like
       this:

              scsi SIEMENS &quot;ST 400&quot; Scanner * * 3 0

       In this configuration, the driver can only access the ST400 model at SCSI
       ID  3 LUN 0 (see section &quot;BUGS&quot; below for the reason).  To use the driver
       with other scanner models, add an appropriate line to  the  configuration
       file.   For  example, to use it with an ST800 at SCSI ID 3 LUN 0, add the
       line:

              scsi SIEMENS &quot;ST 800&quot; Scanner * * 3 0


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/st400.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-st400.a
              The static library implementing this backend.
&#12;       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-st400.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_ST400
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       Everything but the most basic stuff.


BUGS
       Currently,  the backend does not check if the attached device really is a
       ST400.  It will happily accept everything that matches the  configuration
       entries.   This  makes  it  easy to test the backend with other scanners:
       Just add an appropriate line to the configuration file.   The  configura&#8208;
       tion file as distributed (see above) only works with the ST400.  Be care&#8208;
       ful: If there  is  no  config  file  at  all,  the  backend  defaults  to
       /dev/scanner.

       The  ST400  answers on all eight SCSI LUNs.  Normally this is not a prob&#8208;
       lem, as LUN support is usually disabled in SCSI drivers, but if  you  are
       seeing multiple instances of the scanner in a device list, either disable
       LUNs in your SCSI setup or change the entry in the configuration file  to
       match LUN 0 only.


DEBUG
       If   you   encounter   a   bug   please   set  the  environment  variable
       SANE_DEBUG_ST400 to 128 and try to regenerate the problem. Then send me a
       report with the log attached.

       If  you  encounter  a  SCSI  bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images
       please also set the environment  variable  SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI  to  128
       before sending me the report.
