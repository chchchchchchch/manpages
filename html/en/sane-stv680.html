NAME
       sane-stv680 - SANE backend for STV680 camera&apos;s

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-stv680 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some STV680 cameras. This backend  should  be
       considered  beta-quality  software! STV680 cameras are sold under various
       brands like Aiptek.  This backend may or may not support yours.

       The cameras that should work with this backend are:

       Vendor Model              USB vendor id  USB product id  status
       ------------------------  -------------  --------------  --------
       AIPTEK stv680                0x0553         0x0202       basic
       Konica e-mini                0x04c8         0x0722       untested
       DigitalDream l&apos;espion XS     0x1183         0x0001       untested
       Creative WebCam Go mini      0x041e         0x4007       untested

       For all these cameras, see the backend home page (under AUTHOR)  for  the
       exact status of each camera.

       For  startup of this backend check that if present the stv680 kernel mod&#8208;
       ule is removed or disabled.
       Also before using, enable the backend by editing the /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
       file, change #stv680 to stv680.

       For problems with the untested cameras, you should contact the author for
       that.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line  options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xcam.
       For both programs use the -B option needed for size buffer.

       Some frontends examples:
       xcam
              xcam -B

       scanimage: for writing in batch mode to a file or  to  a  new  file  each
       time.
              scanimage  -B  -d  stv680:libusb:001:002  --batch=out.ppm --batch-
              count 5 --mode &quot;Color RGB&quot;
              scanimage -B -d stv680:libusb:001:002  --batch=out%d.ppm  --batch-
              count 5 --mode &quot;Color RGB&quot;

       If you have any success with a camera not listed here, or if you have any
       strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or to the  SANE
       mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d stv680



       Scan Mode


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the webcams valid choices.

              The  read resolution mode is 8 bits, output resolution is 24 bits.
              Selects the resolution for a scan.  The camera  can  do  only  the
              resolutions listed.
&#12;       --Raw  In this mode raw data is displayed

       --Color
              In this mode the bayer unshuffle is done but no color correction

       --Color_RGB
              Bayer unshuffle, color correction

       --Color_RGB_TXT
              Bayer  unshuffle, color correction, textline with date and time is
              added



       Enhancement options


       --white-level-r
              Selects what red radiance level should be considered &quot;white&quot;, when
              scanning some sheets by changing the calibration value loaded into
              the scanner. Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.


       --white-level-g
              Selects what green radiance level should  be  considered  &quot;white&quot;,
              when  scanning  some  sheets  by  changing the calibration i value
              loaded into the scanner. Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.


       --white-level-b
              Selects what blue radiance level  should  be  considered  &quot;white&quot;,
              when scanning some sheets by changing the calibration value loaded
              into the scanner. Scale -32 .. 0 .. +32 in steps of 1.


CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file /etc/sane.d/stv680.conf supports only one informa&#8208;
       tion: the device name to use (eg usb 0x.... 0x....).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-stv680.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-stv680.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_STV680
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.


LIMITATIONS
       The  windows  TWAIN  driver has many more options than this SANE backend.
       However they are only software adjustments. This backend only  implements
       what the webcam can support.
&#12;BUGS
       Plenty. Parts of this backend are still under development.
              1. Some untested cameras.
              2. Video streaming slow and stops sometimes (scanimage).
              3. Sometimes 1/3 of image is NOK (xcam).
