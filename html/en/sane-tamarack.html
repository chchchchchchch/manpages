sane-tamarack(5)          SANE Scanner Access Now Easy          sane-tamarack(5)



NAME
       sane-tamarack - SANE backend for Tamarack flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-tamarack  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following Tamarack flatbed scanners:

              Artiscan 6000C
              Artiscan 8000C
              Artiscan 12000C

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that corresponds to
       a  SCSI scanner. The special device name must be a generic SCSI device or
       a symlink to such a device.  The program sane-find-scanner helps to  find
       out the correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga
       or /dev/sge, for example.  See sane-scsi(5) for details.


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/tamarack.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-tamarack.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-tamarack.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_TAMARACK
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_TAMARACK=4
