sane-teco1(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-teco1(5)



NAME
       sane-teco1 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco1 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend
       should  be considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are sold under
       various brands like RELISYS, PIOTECH, TRUST. This backend may or may  not
       support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           TECO model      status

                Dextra  DF-9624          VM6530+       untested

       Note that the untested scanner will not be directly supported. You should
       contact the author for that.

       The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner. It is
       also  part  of the FCC ID. &quot;sane-find-scanner -v&quot; will also show the scsi
       inquiry, and if it is a TECO scanner, the name will be there too.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or  if  you  have
       any  strange  behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or to the
       SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d teco1


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner  valid  choices
              are  Black &amp; White , Grayscale and Color The Black &amp; White mode is
              black and white only (1 bit). Grayscale will produce 256 levels of
              gray (8 bits). Color will produce a 24 bits color image.
&#12;       --resolution
              selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all resolu&#8208;
              tions between 1 and 600, in increments of 1.



       Geometry options


       -l -t -x -y
              control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate,  -t  the
              top  left  y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area. All parameters  are  specified  in  millimeters  by
              default.



       Enhancement options


       --custom-gamma
              (color  mode  only)  allows the user to specify a gamma table (see
              the next 3 parameters).


       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --green-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --dither
              (Black  &amp; White only) select the dither mask to use. Possible val&#8208;
              ues are Line art , 2x2 , 3x3 , 4x4 bayer , 4x4 smooth , 8x8  bayer
              , 8x8 smooth , 8x8 horizontal and 8x8 vertical



       --preview
              requests  a  preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 22
              dpi and the scan area is the maximum allowed.  The  scan  mode  is
              user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file /etc/sane.d/teco1.conf supports only one informa&#8208;
       tion: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco1.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco1.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO1
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than  this  SANE  backend.
       However  they are only software adjustments. This backend only implements
       what the scanner can support.



BUGS
       None known.
