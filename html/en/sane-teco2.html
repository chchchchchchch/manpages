sane-teco2(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-teco2(5)



NAME
       sane-teco2 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco2 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend
       should  be considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are sold under
       various brands like Mustek, Relisys, Piotech, Primax, TRUST.  This  back&#8208;
       end may or may not support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           TECO model       status
              ----------------------  --------------  -----------
                Mustek ScanMagic 4830S   VM3575        untested
                Primax Jewel 4800        VM356A         good
                Primax Profi 9600        VM6575         basic
                Primax Profi 19200       VM6586         good
                Relisys APOLLO Express 3 VM356A         basic
                Relisys APOLLO Express 6 VM6565         good
                Relisys APOLLO Express 12   ?          untested
                Relisys AVEC II S3       VM3564         good
                Relisys AVEC Super 3     VM3575         basic
                Relisys SCORPIO Pro      VM6575         good
                Relisys SCORPIO Pro-S    VM6586        untested
                Relisys SCORPIO Super 3  VM3575         good

       For all these scanners, lineart and gray mode work well. However, most of
       them do not support more than a handful of resolutions in color mode. See
       the  backend  home page (under AUTHOR) for the exact status of each scan&#8208;
       ner.

       Note that the untested scanner will not be directly supported. You should
       contact the author for that.

       The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner. It is
       also part of the FCC ID.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image, xsane, quiteinsane or kooka.

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or  if  you  have
       any  strange  behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or to the
       SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d teco2


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner  valid  choices
              are  Lineart  , Gray and Color The Lineart mode is black and white
              only (1 bit). Gray mode will produce 256 levels of gray (8  bits).
              Color will produce a 24 bits color image.


       --resolution
              Lineart  and  Gray  selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner
              can do all resolutions between 1 and 600, in increments of 1.


              Color selects the resolution for a scan. The scanner can  do  only
              the resolutions listed.

              All  values with ydpi &gt; 300 (300 x 600) or 600 (600 x 1200) result
              in a wrong proportion for the scan. The proportion can be adjusted
              with   the   following   imagemagick  command:  convert  -geometry
              (dpi/max_xdpi * 100%)x100% max_xdpi is  for  the  vm3575  constant
              with 300 dpi e.g. 600dpi adjust with: convert -geometry 200%x100%


       Geometry options


       -l -t -x -y
              control  the  scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the  height  of
              the  scan  area.  All  parameters  are specified in millimeters by
              default.



       Enhancement options


       --custom-gamma (no custom gamma option for the VM3564 and VM356A)
              (color mode only) allows the user to specify a  gamma  table  (see
              the next 3 parameters).


       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --green-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.


       --white-level-r
              (VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only) Selects what red radiance
              level  should  be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets by
              changing the calibration value  loaded  into  the  scanner.  Scale
              0..64 in steps of 1.


       --white-level-g
              (VM3564,  VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only) Selects what green radi&#8208;
              ance level should be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets
              by changing the calibration i value loaded into the scanner. Scale
              0..64 in steps of 1.


       --white-level-b
              (VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575 only) Selects what  blue  radi&#8208;
              ance level should be considered &quot;white&quot;, when scanning some sheets
              by changing the calibration value loaded into the  scanner.  Scale
              0..64 in steps of 1.
&#12;
       --preview
              requests  a  preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 50
              dpi (for VM356A and VM6575 75 dpi) and the scan area is the  maxi&#8208;
              mum allowed.  The scan mode is user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file /etc/sane.d/teco2.conf supports only one informa&#8208;
       tion: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco2.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

       SANE_TECO2_CAL_ALGO
              Either 0 or 1. Selects the algorithm for the calibration. A  value
              of  1  seems to give better scans on the VM356A, VM3575.  Feedback
              on it is welcome.  For VM3564, VM356A, VM3575, VM6575  default  1.
              For other supported types default 0.



LIMITATIONS
       The  windows  TWAIN  driver has many more options than this SANE backend.
       However they are only software adjustments. This backend only  implements
       what the scanner can support.



BUGS
       Plenty. Parts of this backend are still under development.
