sane-teco3(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-teco3(5)



NAME
       sane-teco3 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco3 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back&#8208;
       end that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend
       should be considered alpha-quality software! TECO scanners are sold under
       various brands like RELYSIS, PIOTECH, TRUST. This backend may or may  not
       support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                Vendor Model                 TECO model   status
                ---------------------------  ----------  ----------
                Relisys Scorpio                VM3552     tested
                Plustek OpticPro 2400SP        VM3552     untested
                PIOTECH Splendeur 3024         VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 2400 SP          VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 4800 SP+         VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 9600 SP          VM3552     untested

       The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner. It is
       also part of the FCC ID.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected  through  command
       line options to programs like scanimage or through GUI elements in xscan&#8208;
       image or xsane.

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or  if  you  have
       any  strange  behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or to the
       SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d teco3


       Scan Mode


       --mode selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner  valid  choices
              are  Black &amp; White , Grayscale and Color The Black &amp; White mode is
              black and white only (1 bit). Grayscale will produce 256 levels of
              gray (8 bits). Color will produce a 24 bits color image.


       --resolution
              selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all resolu&#8208;
              tions between 1 and 1200, in increments of 1.



       Geometry options


       -l -t -x -y
              control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate,  -t  the
              top  left  y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area. All parameters  are  specified  in  millimeters  by
              default.
&#12;       Enhancement options


       --custom-gamma
              (color  mode  only)  allows the user to specify a gamma table (see
              the next 3 parameters).


       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the red channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.


       --green-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the green channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.


       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user defined gamma ta&#8208;
              ble for the blue channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.



       --preview
              requests  a  preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 22
              dpi and the scan area is the maximum allowed.  The  scan  mode  is
              user selected. The default is &quot;no&quot;.



CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file /etc/sane.d/teco3.conf supports only one informa&#8208;
       tion: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).



FILES
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco3.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-teco3.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).



ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO3
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a  value  of  128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.



LIMITATIONS
       The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than  this  SANE  backend.
       However  they are only software adjustments. This backend only implements
       what the scanner can support.



BUGS
       Not much.
