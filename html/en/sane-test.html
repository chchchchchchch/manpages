sane-test(5)              SANE Scanner Access Now Easy              sane-test(5)



NAME
       sane-test - SANE backend for testing frontends

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-test library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that allows testing the SANE installation and SANE  frontends.   It  pro&#8208;
       vides access to a (nearly) unlimited number of virtual devices.  There is
       no support for real scanners or cameras.  However, the backend  simulates
       scanning and setting options.

       The idea is not only to find bugs in frontends but also to show all capa&#8208;
       bilities of SANE.  Therefore sane-test implements functions  and  options
       that are not (or seldom) found in other backends.

       The  backend is commented out in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf, so either the com&#8208;
       ment character must be removed or the backend must be called  explicitly.
       E.g.  `scanimage -d test&apos; or `xscanimage test&apos;.


SCAN MODE OPTIONS
       Option mode selects the scan mode (Gray or Color).

       Option  depth  determines  the  number  of bits per sample (1. 8, or 16).
       Keep in mind, that this value refers to the sample, not  the  pixel.   So
       depth=16  results in 48 bits per pixel in color mode. The most usual com&#8208;
       binations are mode=Gray, depth=1 for lineart, mode=Gray, depth=8 for gray
       and  mode=Color,  depth=8  for  color mode.  The combination of color and
       1-bit mode is quite obscure (8 colors) but allowed in the SANE  standard.
       However, the meaning of bits is not defined. Currently 1 = high intensity
       and 0 = low intensity is used.

       Setting option hand-scanner results in the test-backend behaving  like  a
       hand-scanner.   Hand-scanners  do  not  know  the  image height a priori.
       Instead, they return a height of -1.  Setting this option allows to  test
       whether a frontend can handle this correctly.  This option also enables a
       fixed width of 11 cm.

       Setting option three-pass simulates a three-pass  scanner.   Older  color
       scanners  needed to scan the image once per color (reg/green/blue) to get
       the full image.  Therefore, in this mode three single frames  are  trans&#8208;
       mitted in color mode.

       Option  three-pass-order  provides  support for changing the order of the
       three frames (see option three-pass above).  A  frontend  should  support
       all orders.

       Option resolution sets the resolution of the image in dots per inch.

       Option source can be used to simulate an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF).
       After 10 scans, the ADF will be &quot;empty&quot;.

SPECIAL OPTIONS
       Option test-picture allows to set the image that&apos;s returned to the  fron&#8208;
       tend.  While &quot;Solid white&quot; and &quot;Solid black&quot; are quite obvious, the other
       options need some more explanation.  Color patterns are used to determine
       if  all modes and their colors are represented correctly by the frontend.
       The grid should look like the same in every mode and resolution.  A table
       of     all     the     test     pictures     can     be     found     at:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/test-backend/test-pictures.html.

       If option invert-endianess is set, the upper and  lower  bytes  of  image
       data  in 16 bit modes are exchanged.  This option can be used to test the
       16 bit modes of frontends, e.g. if the frontend uses  the  correct  endi&#8208;
       aness.

       If  option read-limit is set, the maximum amount of data transferred with
       each call to sane_read() is limited.

       Option read-limit-size sets the limit for option read-limit.  A low limit
       slows  down  scanning.   It can be used to detect errors in frontend that
       occur because of wrong assumptions on the size of the  buffer  or  timing
       problems.

       Option read-delay enables delaying data to the frontend.

       Option  read-delay-duration  selects the number of microseconds the back&#8208;
       ends waits after each transfer of a buffer.  This  option  is  useful  to
       find timing-related bugs, especially if used over the network.

       If  option  read-return-value  is  different from &quot;Default&quot;, the selected
       status will be returned by every call to sane_read().  This is useful  to
       test the frontend&apos;s handling of the SANE statii.

       If  option ppl-loss is different from 0, it determines the number of pix&#8208;
       els that are &quot;lost&quot; at the end of  each  line.   That  means,  lines  are
       padded with unused data.

       Option  fuzzy-parameters  selects  that  fuzzy  (inexact)  parameters are
       returned as long as the scan hasn&apos;t been started.   This  option  can  be
       used  to test if the frontend uses the parameters it got before the start
       of the scan (which it shouldn&apos;t).

       Option non-blocking determines if non-blocking IO for sane_read()  should
       be used if supported by the frontend.

       If  option  select-fd  is set, the backend offers a select filedescriptor
       for detecting if sane_read() will return data.

       If option enable-test-options is set, a fairly big list  of  options  for
       testing the various SANE option types is enabled.

       Option  print-options can be used to print a list of all options to stan&#8208;
       dard error.

GEOMETRY OPTIONS
       Option tl-x determines the top-left x position of the scan area.

       Option tl-y determines the top-left y position of the scan area.

       Option br-x determines the bottom-right x position of the scan area.

       Option br-y determines the bottom-right y position of the scan area.

BOOL TEST OPTIONS
       There are 6 bool test options in total.  Each option is numbered.   (3/6)
       means:  this is option 3 of 6.  The numbering scheme is intended for eas&#8208;
       ier detection of options not displayed by the frontend (because of  miss&#8208;
       ing support or bugs).

       Option  bool-soft-select-soft-detect (1/6) is a bool test option that has
       soft select and soft detect (and advanced) capabilities.  That&apos;s  just  a
       normal bool option.

       Option  bool-hard-select-soft-detect (2/6) is a bool test option that has
       hard select and soft detect (and advanced) capabilities.  That means  the
       option  can&apos;t  be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a
       button at the device).
&#12;       Option bool-hard-select (3/6) is a bool test option that has hard  select
       (and  advanced)  capabilities.  That means the option can&apos;t be set by the
       frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a button at  the  device)  and
       can&apos;t be read by the frontend.

       Option  bool-soft-detect (4/6) is a bool test option that has soft detect
       (and advanced) capabilities.  That means the option is read-only.

       Option bool-soft-select-soft-detect-emulated (5/6) is a Bool test  option
       that  has soft select, soft detect, and emulated (and advanced) capabili&#8208;
       ties.

       Option bool-soft-select-soft-detect-auto (6/6) is a Bool test option that
       has  soft select, soft detect, and automatic (and advanced) capabilities.
       This option can be automatically set by the backend.

INT TEST OPTIONS
       There are 6 int test options in total.

       Option int (1/6) is an int test option with no  unit  and  no  constraint
       set.

       Option  int-constraint-range  (2/6) is an int test option with unit pixel
       and constraint range set.  Minimum is 4, maximum 192, and quant is 2.

       Option int-constraint-word-list (3/6) is an int  test  option  with  unit
       bits and constraint word list set.

       Option  int-constraint-array (4/6) is an int test option with unit mm and
       using an array without constraints.

       Option int-constraint-array-constraint-range (5/6) is an int test  option
       with  unit  mm and using an array with a range constraint.  Minimum is 4,
       maximum 192, and quant is 2.

       Option int-constraint-array-constraint-word-list (6/6)  is  an  int  test
       option with unit percent and using an array a word list constraint.


FIXED TEST OPTIONS
       There are 3 fixed test options in total.

       Option  fixed (1/3) is a fixed test option with no unit and no constraint
       set.

       Option fixed-constraint-range (2/3) is a  fixed  test  option  with  unit
       microsecond   and  constraint  range  set.  Minimum  is  -42.17,  maximum
       32767.9999, and quant is 2.0.

       string list constraint.

       Option string-constraint-long-string-list (3/3) is a string  test  option
       with string list constraint. Contains some more entries...

&#12;FILES
       /etc/sane.d/test.conf
              The  backend configuration file (see also description of SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below). The initial values  of  most  of  the  basic  SANE
              options  can be configured in this file. A template containing all
              the default values is provided together with this backend. One  of
              the  more  interesting values may be number_of_devices.  It can be
              used to check the frontend&apos;s  ability  to  show  a  long  list  of
              devices.  The config values concerning resolution and geometry can
              be useful to test the handling of big file sizes.


       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-test.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-test.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_TEST
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_TEST=4
