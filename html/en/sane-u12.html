NAME
       sane-u12  - SANE backend for Plustek USB flatbed scanners, based on older
       parport designs

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-u12 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)  backend
       that  provides  access  to  USB  flatbed scanners based on Plusteks&apos; ASIC
       98003 (parallel-port ASIC) and a GeneSys Logics&apos; USB-parport bridge chip.


SUPPORTED DEVICES
       The backend is able to support some early Plustek USB scanner based their
       old  parport  design  around  the  ASIC  98003 and other rebadged Plustek
       devices. The following tables will give you a short overview.

       If your Plustek scanner has another Product ID, then the  device  is  NOT
       supported by this backend.

       Vendor Plustek - ID: 0x07B3
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       Model:                   Vendor-ID:       Product-ID:
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       OpticPro U12             0x07B3           0x0001
       OpticPro U1212           0x07B3           0x0001
       OpticPro UT12            0x07B3           0x0001

       Vendor KYE/Genius
       --------------------------------------------------------
       USB Model:               Vendor-ID:       Product-ID:
       --------------------------------------------------------
       ColorPage Vivid III USB  0x07B3           0x0001
       ColorPage HR6 V1         0x0458           0x2004

CONFIGURATION
       To  use  your scanner with this backend, you need at least two entries in
       the configuration file /etc/sane.d/u12.conf
              [usb] vendor-id product-id
              device /dev/usbscanner

       [usb] tells the backend, that the following  devicename  (here  /dev/usb&#8208;
       scanner)  has  to  be  interpreted  as USB scanner device. If vendor- and
       product-id has not been specified, the backend tries to  detect  this  by
       its own. If device is set to auto then the next matching device is used.

       The Options:

       option warmup t
              t specifies the warmup period in seconds

       option lampOff t
              t  is  the  time in seconds for switching off the lamps in standby
              mode

       option lOffonEnd b
              b specifies the behaviour when closing the backend, 1  --&gt;  switch
              lamps off, 0 --&gt; do not change lamp status


       See the u12.conf file for examples.

       Note:
       You have to make sure, that the USB subsystem is loaded correctly and you
       have access to the device-node. For more details see  sane-usb  (5)  man&#8208;
       page.  You  might  use sane-find-scanner to check that you have access to
       your device.

       Note:
       If there&apos;s no configuration file, the backend defaults to device auto


FILES
       /etc/sane.d/u12.conf
              The backend configuration file

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-u12.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-u12.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This  environment  variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX,  the  directories
              are  separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated by
              a semi-colon (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set,  the  configura&#8208;
              tion  file is searched in two default directories: first, the cur&#8208;
              rent working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and  then  in  /etc/sane.d.   If  the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly  specified directories.  For example, setting SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result  in  directories  &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_U12
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable  controls  the  debug  level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_U12=10

CONTACT AND BUG-REPORTS
       Please send any information and bug-reports to:
       SANE Mailing List

       Additional info and hints can be obtained from our
       Mailing-List archive at:
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html

       or directly from the projects&apos; homepage at:
       http://www.gjaeger.de/scanner/u12/

       To  obtain  debug  messages from the backend, please set the environment-
       variable SANE_DEBUG_U12 before calling your favorite scan-frontend  (i.e.
       xscanimage).
       i.e.: export SANE_DEBUG_U12=20 ; xscanimage

       The value controls the verbosity of the backend.
&#12;
KNOWN BUGS &amp; RESTRICTIONS
       * The driver is in alpha state, so please don&apos;t expect too much!!!

       *  When using libusb, it might be, that the backend hangs.  In that case,
       reconnect the scanner.
