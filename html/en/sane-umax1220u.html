sane-umax1220u(5)         SANE Scanner Access Now Easy         sane-umax1220u(5)



NAME
       sane-umax1220u  - SANE backend for the UMAX Astra 1220U and similar scan&#8208;
       ners


DESCRIPTION
       The sane-umax1220 library implements a SANE  (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend for the the UMAX Astra 1220U and similar scanners.

       For     more     information    on    this    backend,    please    visit
       http://umax1220u-sane.sourceforge.net/.


UMAX ASTRA 1600U/2000U/2100U SUPPORT
       This backend is also able to drive the UMAX Astra 1600U/2000U/2100U.  The
       2100U  is  confirmed to work. For the other scanners no reports have been
       received yet. Please contact  us  and  tell  us  if  your  scanner  works
       (sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org).


CONFIGURATION
       Usually, no manual configuration is necessary. The configuration file for
       this backend resides in /etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf.

       Its contents is a list of device names  that  correspond  to  UMAX  Astra
       scanners.   Empty  lines  and  lines  starting  with  a hash mark (#) are
       ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:

        #usb vendor product
        usb 0x1606 0x0010
        # Device list for non-linux systems
        /dev/scanner
        /dev/usb/scanner0

       See sane-usb(5) for information on how to set the access  permissions  on
       the usb device files.


FILES
       The backend configuration file:
              /etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf

       The static library implementing this backend:
              /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-umax1220u.a

       The shared library implementing this backend:
              /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-umax1220u.so  (present  on sys&#8208;
              tems that support dynamic loading)


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to  be  printed.  Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity:

              SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U values

              Number  Remark

               1       print failures
               2       print information
               3       print high-level function calls
               4       print high-level function checkpoints
               9       print mid-level function calls
               10      print mid-level function checkpoints
               80      print protocol-level function entry
               90      print protocol-level function exit


       Example:
              export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U=10


KNOWN BUGS
       600 dpi scanning may fail for large image sizes.

       If  you keep getting I/O errors, try cycling the power on your scanner to
       reset it.

       There is no way to cancel a scan, since the driver ignores sane_cancel().

       If you try scanning an image which is too small, you will get I/O errors.
       Be  sure  to  adjust the scan area before doing a scan, since by default,
       the scan area is zero.

REPORTING BUGS
       This backend isn&apos;t actively maintained.  Nevertheless,  bug  reports  and
       comments  should  be sent to the sane-devel mailing list.  When reporting
       bugs, please run the backend with  SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U  set  to  10  and
       attach a copy of the log messages.
