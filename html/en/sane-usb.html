NAME
       sane-usb - USB configuration tips for SANE

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  contains information on how to access scanners with a
       USB interface. It focusses  on  two  main  topics:  getting  the  scanner
       detected by the operating system kernel and using it with SANE.

       This  page  applies  to  USB  most backends and scanners, as they use the
       generic sanei_usb interface. However, there is one exceptions: USB  Scan&#8208;
       ners supported by the microtek2 backend need a special USB kernel driver,
       see sane-microtek2(5) for details.


QUICK START
       This is a short HOWTO-like section. For the full details, read  the  fol&#8208;
       lowing  sections. The goal of this section is to get the scanner detected
       by sane-find-scanner(1).

       Run sane-find-scanner. If it lists your scanner with the  correct  vendor
       and product ids, you are done. See section SANE ISSUES for details on how
       to go on.

       sane-find-scanner doesn&apos;t list your scanner? Does it  work  as  root?  If
       yes, there is a permission issue. See the LIBUSB section for details.

       Nothing  is  found  even as root? Check that your kernel supports USB and
       that libusb is installed (see section LIBUSB).


USB ACCESS METHODS
       For accessing USB devices, the USB library libusb is used. There used  to
       exist  another  method  to access USB devices: the kernel scanner driver.
       The kernel scanner driver method is deprecated and shouldn&apos;t be used any&#8208;
       more. It may be removed from SANE at any time. In Linux, the kernel scan&#8208;
       ner driver has been removed in  the  2.6.*  kernel  series.  Only  libusb
       access is documented in this manual page.


LIBUSB
       SANE  can  only  use  libusb  0.1.6 or newer. It needs to be installed at
       build-time. Modern Linux distributions and other operating  systems  come
       with libusb.

       Libusb  can  only  access  your scanner if it&apos;s not claimed by the kernel
       scanner driver. If you want to use libusb, unload the kernel driver (e.g.
       rmmod  scanner  under  Linux)  or disable the driver when compiling a new
       kernel. For Linux, your kernel  needs  support  for  the  USB  filesystem
       (usbfs).  For  kernels older than 2.4.19, replace &quot;usbfs&quot; with &quot;usbdevfs&quot;
       because the name has changed. This filesystem  must  be  mounted.  That&apos;s
       done automatically at boot time, if /etc/fstab contains a line like this:

              none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults  0  0

       The  permissions for the device files used by libusb must be adjusted for
       user access. Otherwise only root can use SANE  devices.  For  Linux,  the
       devices  are  located  in  /proc/bus/usb/  or in /dev/bus/usb, if you use
       udev. There are directories named e.g. &quot;001&quot; (the  bus  name)  containing
       files &quot;001&quot;, &quot;002&quot; etc. (the device files). The right device files can be
       found out by running scanimage  -L  as  root.  Setting  permissions  with
       &quot;chmod&quot;  is  not  permanent,  however. They will be reset after reboot or
       replugging the scanner.

       Usually udev or for older distributions the hotplug utilities  are  used,
       which support dynamic setting of access permissions. SANE comes with udev
       and hotplug scripts in the directory tools/udev and  tools/hotplug.  They
       can   be   used   for   setting   permissions,   see  /usr/share/doc/lib&#8208;
       sane/README.linux, tools/README  and  the  README  in  the  tools/hotplug
       directory for more details.

       For  the BSDs, the device files used by libusb are named /dev/ugen*.  Use
       chmod to apply appropriate permissions.


SANE ISSUES
       This section assumes that your scanner is detected by  sane-find-scanner.
       It  doesn&apos;t  make  sense  to  go  on,  if  this  is  not  the case. While
       sane-find-scanner is able to detect any USB scanner, actual scanning will
       only  work  if the scanner is supported by a SANE backend. Information on
       the   level   of   support   can   be   found   on   the   SANE   webpage
       (http://www.sane-project.org/), and the individual backend manpages.

       Most  backends can detect USB scanners automatically using &quot;usb&quot; configu&#8208;
       ration file lines. This method allows to identify  scanners  by  the  USB
       vendor and product numbers.  The syntax for specifying a scanner this way
       is:

              usb VENDOR PRODUCT

       where VENDOR is the USB vendor id, and PRODUCT is the USB product  id  of
       the  scanner.  Both  ids  are  non-negative integer numbers in decimal or
       hexadecimal format. The correct values for these fields can be  found  by
       running  sane-find-scanner,  looking into the syslog (e.g., /var/log/mes&#8208;
       sages) or under Linux by issuing the command &quot;cat /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot;.
       This is an example of a config file line:

              usb 0x055f 0x0006

       would have the effect that all USB devices in the system with a vendor id
       of 0x55f and a product id of 0x0006 would be probed and recognized by the
       backend.

       If  your  scanner  is  not detected automatically, it may be necessary to
       edit the appropriate backend configuration file before using SANE for the
       first  time.   For a detailed description of each backend&apos;s configuration
       file,  please  refer  to  the  relevant   backend   manual   page   (e.g.
       sane-mustek_usb(5) for Mustek USB scanners).

       Do  not create a symlink from /dev/scanner to the USB device because this
       link is used by the SCSI backends. The scanner  may  be  confused  if  it
       receives SCSI commands.


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_USB
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for the USB I/O  subsys&#8208;
              tem.   E.g.,  a  value  of  128  requests  all  debug output to be
              printed.  Smaller levels reduce verbosity. Values greater  than  4
              enable   libusb   debugging   (if   available).   Example:  export
              SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_USB=4.
