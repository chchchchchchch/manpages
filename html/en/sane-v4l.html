sane-v4l(5)               SANE Scanner Access Now Easy               sane-v4l(5)



NAME
       sane-v4l - SANE interface for Video for Linux API

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-v4l library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides generic access to video cameras and similar equipment using
       the V4L (Video for Linux) API.

       This  is ALPHA software. Really! Important features are missing and there
       are lots of bugs. The code is currently only tested on a Linux 2.4 system
       with a Hauppauge WinTV video card.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special  is  the UNIX path-name for the special device that corre&#8208;
       sponds to the v4l device.  The special device name must be a  v4l  device
       or  a symlink to such a device.  For example, such a device name could be
       /dev/video0 or /dev/bttv0.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the v4l.conf file is a list of device names  that  corre&#8208;
       spond  to  v4l  devices.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
       (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/bttv0
              # this is a comment
              /dev/video3

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/v4l.conf
              The backend configuration file (see also description of  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-v4l.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-v4l.so
              The  shared  library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_V4L
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this envi&#8208;
              ronment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
              a value of 128 requests all debug output to be  printed.   Smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS:
       If  more than one video card is present, a crash may occur. Frequency and
       geometry selection is missing.
