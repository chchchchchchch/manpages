NAME
       sane-xerox_mfp - SANE backend for Xerox Phaser 3200MFP device

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-xerox_mfp  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following USB and network  multifunc&#8208;
       tion-peripheral:

              Phaser 3200MFP
              Dell MFP Laser Printer 1815dn
              Xerox Phaser 6110MFP
              Samsung CLX-3170fn &amp; CLX-3175FW
              Samsung SCX-4200
              Samsung SCX-4300
              Samsung SCX-4500
              Samsung SCX-4500W
              Samsung SCX4725-FN
              Xerox WorkCentre 3119 Series

       If  you  own  a  scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
       this backend, please let us know this  by  sending  the  scanner&apos;s  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and   device   ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices, sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us.  Even  if  the
       scanner&apos;s  name  is  only  slightly  different  from the models mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf USB scanners do not need any configuration.

       For SCX-4500W in network mode you need to specify

              tcp host_address [port]

       The host_address is passed through resolver, thus can be a dotted quad or
       a name from /etc/hosts or resolvable through DNS.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf
              The  backend configuration file. By default all scanner types/mod&#8208;
              els are enabled, you may want to comment out unwanted.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-xerox_mfp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane/libsane-xerox_mfp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present  on  systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_XEROX_MFP  If  the  library  was  compiled  with debug support
       enabled, this environment variable controls  the  debug  level  for  this
       backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

       Example: export SANE_DEBUG_XEROX_MFP=4

BUGS:
       Multicast autoconfiguration for LAN scanners is not implemented yet. IPv6
       addressing never been tested.
