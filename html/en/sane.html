NAME
       sane - Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing scanners


DESCRIPTION
       SANE  is  an  application programming interface (API) that provides stan&#8208;
       dardized access to any raster image scanner  hardware.  The  standardized
       interface  makes  it  possible  to write just one driver for each scanner
       device instead of one driver for each scanner and application.

       While SANE is primarily targeted at a UNIX environment, the standard  has
       been  carefully designed to make it possible to implement the API on vir&#8208;
       tually any hardware or operating system.

       This manual page provides a summary of the  information  available  about
       SANE.

       If you have trouble getting your scanner detected, read the PROBLEMS sec&#8208;
       tion.


TERMINOLOGY
       An application that uses the SANE interface is called a SANE frontend.  A
       driver  that  implements  the SANE interface is called a SANE backend.  A
       meta backend provides some means to manage one or more other backends.



SOFTWARE PACKAGES
       The package `sane-backends&apos; contains a  lot  of  backends,  documentation
       (including  the  SANE standard), networking support, and the command line
       frontend `scanimage&apos;.  The frontends `xscanimage&apos;, `xcam&apos;, and  `scanadf&apos;
       are included in the package `sane-frontends&apos;.  Both packages can be down&#8208;
       loaded from the SANE homepage  (http://www.sane-project.org/).   Informa&#8208;
       tion  about  other  frontends  and backends can also be found on the SANE
       homepage.


GENERAL INFORMATION
       The following sections provide  short  descriptions  and  links  to  more
       information  about  several  aspects  of  SANE.   A name with a number in
       parenthesis (e.g.  `sane-dll(5)&apos;) points to a manual page. In  this  case
       `man 5 sane-dll&apos; will display the page. Entries like `/usr/share/doc/lib&#8208;
       sane/sane.tex&apos; are references to text files that were copied to the  SANE
       documentation  directory  (/usr/share/doc/libsane/)  during installation.
       Everything else is a URL to a resource on the web.


       SANE homepage
         Information on all aspects of SANE including a tutorial and a  link  to
         the    SANE    FAQ    can    be    found    on   the   SANE   homepage:
         http://www.sane-project.org/.

       SANE device lists
         The SANE device lists contain information about the status of SANE sup&#8208;
         port for a specific device. If your scanner is not listed there (either
         supported or unsupported), please contact us. See section HOW  CAN  YOU
         HELP  SANE  for details. There are lists for specific releases of SANE,
         for  the   current   development   version   and   a   search   engine:
         http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.  The lists are
         also installed on your system at /usr/share/doc/libsane/.
&#12;       SANE mailing list
         There is a mailing list for the purpose of discussing the SANE standard
         and its implementations: sane-devel.  Despite its name, the list is not
         only intended for developers, but also for users. There are  also  some
         more  lists  for  special topics, however, for users, sane-devel is the
         right     list.     How     to     subscribe      and      unsubscribe:
         http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.

       SANE IRC channel
         The  IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel #sane can be found on the Freen&#8208;
         ode network (irc.freenode.net).  It&apos;s  for  discussing  SANE  problems,
         talking  about  development  and  general SANE related chatting. Before
         asking for help, please read the other documentation mentioned in  this
         manual  page.  The  channel&apos;s  topic  is also used for announcements of
         problems with SANE infrastructure (mailing lists, web server, etc.).

       Compiling and installing SANE
         Look at /usr/share/doc/libsane/README and the os-dependent README files
         for information about compiling and installing SANE.

         sane-test(5).

       v4l
         The  sane-v4l  library  implements a SANE backend that provides generic
         access to video cameras and similar equipment using the V4L (Video  for
         Linux) API. See sane-v4l(5).

       Also,    have    a    look   at   the   backend   information   page   at
       http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html and the  list  of
       projects in /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS.


CHANGING THE TOP-LEVEL BACKEND
       By  default,  all  SANE  backends (drivers) are loaded dynamically by the
       sane-dll meta backend. If you have any questions about the dynamic  load&#8208;
       ing,  read  sane-dll(5).  SANE frontend can also be linked to other back&#8208;
       ends  directly  by  copying  or  linking  a  backend  to  libsane.so   in
       /usr/lib/arch_triplet/sane.

DEVELOPER&apos;S DOCUMENTATION
       It&apos;s  not  hard  to write a SANE backend. It can take some time, however.
       You should have basic knowledge of C and enough patience to work  through
       the documentation and find out how your scanner works. Appended is a list
       of some documents that help to write backends and frontends.

       The SANE standard defines the  application  programming  interface  (API)
       that  is  used  to  communicate between frontends and backends. It can be
       found at /usr/share/doc/libsane/sane.ps (if latex is  installed  on  your
       system)   and  on  the  SANE  website:  http://www.sane-project.org/html/
       (HTML), or http://www.sane-project.org/sane.ps (Postscript).

       There is some more information  for  programmers  in  /usr/share/doc/lib&#8208;
       sane/backend-writing.txt.  Most of the internal SANE routines (sanei) are
       documented using doxygen: http://www.sane-project.org/sanei/.   Before  a
       new   backend   or   frontend   project   is  started,  have  a  look  at
       /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS for projects that are planned or not  yet
       included  into  the  SANE  distribution  and  at our bug-tracking system:
       http://www.http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html.

       There are some links on how to find out about the protocol of a  scanner:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/misc/develop.html.


       If  you  start  writing  a backend or frontend or any other part of SANE,
       please contact the sane-devel mailing list for coordination so  the  same
       work isn&apos;t done twice.

PROBLEMS
       If  your  device isn&apos;t found but you know that it is supported, make sure
       that it is detected by your operating system. For SCSI and USB  scanners,
       use the sane-find-scanner tool (see sane-find-scanner(1) for details). It
       prints one line for each scanner it has detected and some  comments  (#).
       If  sane-find-scanner  finds  your scanner only as root but not as normal
       user, the permissions for the device files are not adjusted correctly. If
       the  scanner  isn&apos;t found at all, the operating system hasn&apos;t detected it
       and may need some help. Depending on  the  type  of  your  scanner,  read
       sane-usb(5)  or  sane-scsi(5).   If your scanner (or other device) is not
       connected over the SCSI bus or USB, read the backend&apos;s  manual  page  for
       details on how to set it up.

       Now  your  scanner  is  detected by the operating system but not by SANE?
       Try scanimage -L.  If the scanner is not found, check that the  backend&apos;s
       name  is  mentioned in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  Some backends are commented
       out by default. Remove the comment sign for your backend  in  this  case.
       Also  some  backends aren&apos;t compiled at all if one of their prerequisites
       are missing. Examples include dc210, dc240,  canon_pp,  hpsj5s,  gphoto2,
       pint,  qcam,  v4l,  net,  sm3600, snapscan, pnm. If you need one of these
       backends and they aren&apos;t available, read the build  instructions  in  the
       README file and the individual manual pages of the backends.

       Another reason for not being detected by scanimage -L may be a missing or
       wrong configuration in the backend&apos;s configuration file. While SANE tries
       to  automatically find most scanners, some can&apos;t be setup correctly with&#8208;
       out the intervention of the administrator. Also on some operating systems
       auto-detection may not work. Check the backend&apos;s manual page for details.

       If  your  scanner is still not found, try setting the various environment
       variables that are available to assist  in  debugging.   The  environment
       variables  are  documented in the relevant manual pages.  For example, to
       get the maximum amount of debug information when testing  a  Mustek  SCSI
       scanner, set environment variables SANE_DEBUG_DLL, SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK, and
       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 and then invoke scanimage -L  .   The  debug
       messages  for  the  dll  backend tell if the mustek backend was found and
       loaded at all. The mustek messages explain what  the  mustek  backend  is
       doing while the SCSI debugging shows the low level handling. If you can&apos;t
       find out what&apos;s going on by checking the messages carefully, contact  the
       sane-devel mailing list for help (see REPORTING BUGS below).

       Now that your scanner is found by scanimage -L, try to do a scan: scanim&#8208;
       age &gt;image.pnm.  This command starts a scan for the default scanner  with
       default settings. All the available options are listed by running scanim&#8208;
       age --help.  If scanning aborts with an error message, turn on  debugging
       as  mentioned above. Maybe the configuration file needs some tuning, e.g.
       to setup the path to a firmware that is needed by some scanners. See  the
       backend&apos;s  manual  page  for details. If you can&apos;t find out what&apos;s wrong,
       contact sane-devel.

       To check that the SANE libraries are installed correctly you can use  the
       test backend, even if you don&apos;t have a scanner or other SANE device:

              scanimage -d test -T

       You  should  get  a  list  of PASSed tests. You can do the same with your
       backend by changing &quot;test&quot; to your backend&apos;s name.

       So now scanning with scanimage works and you  want  to  use  one  of  the
       graphical  frontends  like  xsane,  xscanimage,  or quiteinsane but those
       frontends don&apos;t detect your scanner? One reason may be that you installed
       two  versions  of SANE.  E.g. the version that was installed by your dis&#8208;
       tribution in /usr and one you installed from source in /usr/local/.  Make
       sure that only one version is installed. Another possible reason is, that
       your system&apos;s dynamic loader can&apos;t find the SANE  libraries.  For  Linux,
       make  sure that /etc/ld.so.conf contains /usr/local/lib and does not con&#8208;
       tain /usr/local/lib/sane.  See also the documentation of the frontends.
