saned(8)                  SANE Scanner Access Now Easy                  saned(8)



NAME
       saned - SANE network daemon

SYNOPSIS
       saned [ -a [ username ] | -d [ n ] | -s [ n ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       saned  is  the  SANE  (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon that allows remote
       clients to access image acquisition devices available on the local host.

OPTIONS
       The -a flag requests that saned run in standalone daemon  mode.  In  this
       mode,  saned will detach from the console and run in the background, lis&#8208;
       tening for incoming client connections; inetd is not required  for  saned
       operations  in  this  mode.  If the optional username is given after -a ,
       saned will drop root privileges and run as this user (and group).

       The -d and -s flags request that saned run in debug mode (as  opposed  to
       inetd(8)  mode).   In  this mode, saned explicitly waits for a connection
       request.  When compiled with debugging enabled, these flags may  be  fol&#8208;
       lowed  by a number to request debug info. The larger the number, the more
       verbose the debug output.  E.g., -d128 will request printing of all debug
       info. Debug level 0 means no debug output at all. The default value is 2.
       If flag -d is used, the debug messages will be printed to stderr while -s
       requests using syslog.

       If saned is run from inetd or xinetd, no option can be given.

CONFIGURATION
       First  and  foremost: saned is not intended to be exposed to the internet
       or other non-trusted networks. Make sure that access is limited  by  tcp&#8208;
       wrappers  and/or  a  firewall  setup.  Don&apos;t  depend  only on saned&apos;s own
       authentication. Don&apos;t run saned as root if it&apos;s not necessary. And do not
       install saned as setuid root.

       The  saned.conf  configuration  file contains both options for the daemon
       and the access list.

       data_portrange = min_port - max_port
              Specify the port range to use for the data connection. Pick a port
              range  between  1024 and 65535; don&apos;t pick a too large port range,
              as it may have performance issues. Use this option if  your  saned
              server  is  sitting behind a firewall. If that firewall is a Linux
              machine,  we  strongly  recommend  using  the  Netfilter   nf_con&#8208;
              ntrack_sane module instead.

       The access list is a list of host names, IP addresses or IP subnets (CIDR
       notation) that are permitted to use local SANE  devices.  IPv6  addresses
       must  be  enclosed  in  brackets, and should always be specified in their
       compressed form. Connections from localhost are always  permitted.  Empty
       lines  and  lines  starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A line con&#8208;
       taining the single character ``+&apos;&apos; is interpreted to match any  hostname.
       This  allows  any  remote  machine  to use your scanner and may present a
       security risk, so this shouldn&apos;t be used  unless  you  know  what  you&apos;re
       doing.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              # Daemon options
              data_portrange = 10000 - 10100
              # Access list
              scan-client.somedomain.firm
              # this is a comment
              192.168.0.1
              192.168.2.12/29
              [::1]
              [2001:7a8:185e::42:12]/64

       The  case  of  the host names does not matter, so AHost.COM is considered
       identical to ahost.com.

INETD CONFIGURATION
       For saned to work properly in its default mode of operation, it  is  also
       necessary to add a configuration line to /etc/inetd.conf.  Note that your
       inetd must support IPv6 if you want to  connect  to  saned  over  IPv6  ;
       xinetd  and openbsd-inetd are known to support IPv6, check the documenta&#8208;
       tion for your inetd daemon.

       The configuration line normally looks like this:

              sane-port stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/saned saned

       However, if your system uses tcpd(8) for additional  security  screening,
       you  may  want  to  disable  saned  access  control  by  putting ``+&apos;&apos; in
       saned.conf and use a  line  of  the  following  form  in  /etc/inetd.conf
       instead:

              sane-port    stream    tcp   nowait   saned.saned   /usr/sbin/tcpd
              /usr/sbin/saned

       Note that both examples assume that there is a saned group  and  a  saned
       user.   If you follow this example, please make sure that the access per&#8208;
       missions on the special device are set such that  saned  can  access  the
       scanner  (the  program  generally  needs read and write access to scanner
       devices).

       If xinetd is installed on your system  instead  of  inetd  the  following
       example for xinetd.conf may be helpful:

              # default: off
              # description: The sane server accepts requests
              # for network access to a local scanner via the
              # network.
              service sane-port
              {
                 port        = 6566
                 socket_type = stream
                 wait        = no
                 user        = saned
                 group       = saned
                 server      = /usr/sbin/saned
              }

       Finally,  it  is  also  necessary  to add a line of the following form to
       /etc/services:

              sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon

       The official IANA short name for port 6566 is &quot;sane-port&quot;. The older name
       &quot;sane&quot; is now deprecated.


FILES
       /etc/hosts.equiv
              The  hosts  listed  in this file are permitted to access all local
              SANE devices.  Caveat: this file imposes  serious  security  risks
              and its use is not recommended.
&#12;       /etc/sane.d/saned.conf
              Contains  a  list  of hosts permitted to access local SANE devices
              (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /etc/sane.d/saned.users
              If this file contains lines of the form

              user:password:backend

              access to the listed backends is  restricted.  A  backend  may  be
              listed  multiple  times  for different user/password combinations.
              The server uses MD5 hashing if supported by the client.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of  directories  that
              may  contain  the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are separated by a colon (`:&apos;), under OS/2, they are separated  by
              a  semi-colon  (`;&apos;).  If this variable is not set, the configura&#8208;
              tion file is searched in two default directories: first, the  cur&#8208;
              rent  working  directory  (&quot;.&quot;)  and  then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separa&#8208;
              tor character, then the default directories are searched after the
              explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting  SANE_CON&#8208;
              FIG_DIR  to  &quot;/tmp/config:&quot;  would result in directories &quot;tmp/con&#8208;
              fig&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).
