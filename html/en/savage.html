DESCRIPTION
       savage  is  an  Xorg  driver  for  the S3 Savage family video accelerator
       chips.  2D, 3D, and Xv acceleration is supported on all chips except  the
       Savage2000  (2D  only).   Dualhead  operation is supported on MX, IX, and
       SuperSavage chips.  The savage driver supports PCI and  AGP  boards  with
       the following chips:

       Savage3D        (8a20 and 8a21) (2D, 3D)

       Savage4         (8a22) (2D, 3D)

       Savage2000      (9102) (2D only)

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              These two options interact to specify hardware or software cursor.
              If the SWCursor option  is  specified,  any  HWCursor  setting  is
              ignored.   Thus, either &quot;HWCursor off&quot; or &quot;SWCursor on&quot; will force
              the use of the software cursor.  On Savage/MX and Savage/IX  chips
              which  are  connected  to  LCDs, a software cursor will be forced,
              because the Savage hardware cursor does not  correctly  track  the
              automatic panel expansion feature.  Default: hardware cursor.

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Chooses   between  available  acceleration  architectures.   Valid
              options are XAA and EXA.   XAA  is  the  traditional  acceleration
              architecture  and  support  for it is very stable.  EXA is a newer
              acceleration architecture with better performance for  the  Render
              and  Composite  extensions, but the rendering code for it is newer
              and possibly unstable.  The default is XAA.

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot;
              Rotate the desktop 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.  This
              option  forces  the  ShadowFB option on, and disables acceleration
              and the RandR extension.  Default: no rotation.

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable use  of  the  shadow  framebuffer  layer.   This
              option disables acceleration.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;LCDClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot;
              Override the maximum dot clock.  Some LCD panels produce incorrect
              results if they are driven at too fast of a frequency.  If UseBIOS
              is  on,  the  BIOS  will usually restrict the clock to the correct
              range.  If not, it might be necessary to override  it  here.   The
              frequency   parameter  may  be  specified  as  an  integer  in  Hz
              (135750000), or with standard suffixes like &quot;k&quot;,  &quot;kHz&quot;,  &quot;M&quot;,  or
              &quot;MHz&quot; (as in 135.75MHz).

       Option &quot;CrtOnly&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  option  disables output to the LCD and enables output to the
              CRT port only.  It is useful on laptops if you only  want  to  use
              the CRT port or to force the CRT output only on desktop cards that
              use mobile chips. Default: auto-detect active outputs

       Option &quot;UseBIOS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable use of the video BIOS to change modes.  Ordinar&#8208;
              ily,  the  savage  driver  tries  to use the video BIOS to do mode
              switches.  This generally  produces  the  best  results  with  the
              mobile chips (/MX and /IX), since the BIOS knows how to handle the
              critical but unusual timing requirements of the various LCD panels
              supported  by  the  chip.  To do this, the driver searches through
              the BIOS mode list,  looking  for  the  mode  which  most  closely
              matches  the  xorg.conf  mode line.  Some purists find this scheme
              objectionable.  If you would rather have  the  savage  driver  use
              your mode line timing exactly, turn off the UseBios option.  Note:
              Use of the BIOS is required for dualhead operation.   Default:  on
              (use the BIOS).

       Option &quot;IgnoreEDID&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Do  not  use  EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used
              for monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option.
              The default value is off.

       Option &quot;ShadowStatus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enables the use of a shadow status register.  There is a chip  bug
              in the Savage graphics engine that can cause a bus lock when read&#8208;
              ing the engine status register under  heavy  load,  such  as  when
              scrolling  text  or dragging windows.  The bug affects about 4% of
              all Savage users without DRI and a large fraction  of  users  with
              DRI.  If your system hangs regularly while scrolling text or drag&#8208;
              ging windows, try turning this option on.  This uses an  alternate
              method  of reading the engine status which is slightly more expen&#8208;
              sive, but avoids the  problem.   When  DRI  is  enabled  then  the
              default  is  &quot;on&quot;  (use  shadow  status), otherwise the default is
              &quot;off&quot; (use normal status register).

       Option &quot;DisableCOB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables the COB (Command Overflow Buffer) on  savage4  and  newer
              chips.   There  is supposedly a HW cache coherency problem on cer&#8208;
              tain savage4 and newer chips that renders the COB useless. If  you
              are  having problems with 2D acceleration you can disable the COB,
              however you will lose some performance.  3D acceleration  requires
              the  COB  to  work.  This option only applies to Savage4 and newer
              chips.  Default: &quot;off&quot; (use COB).

       Option &quot;BCIforXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Use the BCI to copy and reformat Xv pixel data.  Using the BCI for
              Xv  causes  graphics  artifacts  on  some chips.  This option only
              applies to Savage4 and prosavage/twister chips. On  some  combina&#8208;
              tions of chipsets and video players, BCI formatting might actually
              be slower than software formatting (&quot;AGPforXv&quot; might help in  this
              case).  BCI formatting can only be used on video data with a width
              that is a multiple of 16 pixels (which is  the  vast  majority  of
              videos).   Other  widths  are handled through software formatting.
              Default: on for prosavage and twister (use BCI for  Xv);  off  for
              savage4 (do not use the BCI for Xv).

       Option &quot;AGPforXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Instructs  the  BCI  Xv  pixel  formatter  to  use AGP memory as a
              scratch buffer.  Ordinarily the BCI formatter uses a  an  area  in
              framebuffer  memory  to  hold YV12 planar data to be converted for
              display. This requires a somewhat expensive upload of YV12 data to
              framebuffer memory. The &quot;AGPforXv&quot; option causes the BCI formatter
              to place the YV12  data  in  AGP  memory  instead,  which  can  be
              uploaded  faster  than  the  framebuffer.  Use of this option cuts
              upload overhead by 25% according to benchmarks. This  option  also
              smooths  out most of the shearing present when using BCI for pixel
              conversion. Currently this option is experimental and is  disabled
              by default. Video width restrictions that apply to &quot;BCIforXv&quot; also
              apply here. Only valid when &quot;DRI&quot; and &quot;BCIforXv&quot; are both  active,
              and only on AGP chipsets. Default: &quot;off&quot;.
              If  &quot;AccelMethod&quot;  is set to &quot;EXA&quot; and &quot;AGPforXv&quot; is enabled, then
              the driver will also attempt to reuse the AGP scratch  buffer  for
              UploadToScreen acceleration.

       Option &quot;AGPMode&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Set AGP data transfer rate.  (used only when DRI is enabled)
              1      -- x1 (default)
              2      -- x2
              4      -- x4
              others -- invalid

       Option &quot;AGPSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              The  amount of AGP memory that will allocated for DMA and textures
              in MB. Valid sizes are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256. The  default
              is 16MB.

       Option &quot;DmaMode&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              This  option influences in which way DMA (direct memory access) is
              used by the kernel and 3D drivers.
              Any      -- Try command DMA first, then vertex DMA (default)
              Command  -- Only use command DMA or don&apos;t use DMA at all
              Vertex   -- Only use vertex DMA or don&apos;t use DMA at all
              None     -- Disable DMA
              Command and vertex DMA cannot be enabled at the same  time.  Which
              DMA  mode is actually used in the end also depends on the DRM ver&#8208;
              sion (only &gt;= 2.4.0 supports command DMA) and the  hardware  (Sav&#8208;
              age3D/MX/IX doesn&apos;t support command DMA).

       Option &quot;DmaType&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              The  type  of  memory  that  will be used by the 3D driver for DMA
              (direct memory access).
              PCI    -- PCI memory (default on PCI cards)
              AGP    -- AGP memory (default on AGP cards)
              &quot;AGP&quot; only works if you have an AGP card.

       Option &quot;BusType&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              The bus type that will be used to access the graphics card.
              PCI    -- PCI bus (default on PCI cards)
              AGP    -- AGP bus (default on AGP cards)
              &quot;AGP&quot; only works if you have an AGP card. If you choose  &quot;PCI&quot;  on
              an  AGP  card  the AGP bus speed is not set and no AGP aperture is
              allocated. This implies DmaType &quot;PCI&quot;.

       Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable DRI support.  This option allows you to enable  or  disable
              the DRI.  Default: &quot;on&quot; (enable DRI).
