SCCMAP(1)                                                              SCCMAP(1)



NAME
       sccmap - extract strongly connected components of directed graphs

SYNOPSIS
       sccmap [-dsv] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       sccmap decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components and an aux&#8208;
       iliary map of the relationship between components.   In  this  map,  each
       component  is collapsed into a node.  The resulting graphs are printed to
       standard out.  The number of nodes, edges and strongly  connected  compo&#8208;
       nents  are  printed  to  standard error.  sccmap is a way of partitioning
       large graphs into more manageable pieces.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -d     Preserve degenerate components of only one node.

       -s     Do not print the resulting graphs. Only the statistics are  impor&#8208;
              tant.

       -S     Just print the resulting graphs. No statistics are printed.

       -ooutput
              Prints  output  to the file output. If not given, sccmap uses std&#8208;
              out.

       -v     Generate additional statistics. In particular, sccmap  prints  the
              number  of  nodes,  edges, connected components, and strongly con&#8208;
              nected components, followed by the fraction of  nodes  in  a  non-
              trivial  strongly  connected components, the maximum degree of the
              graph, and fraction of non-tree edges in the graph.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If  no
               files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

DIAGNOSTICS
       sccmap  emits a warning if it encounters an undirected graph, and ignores
       it.
