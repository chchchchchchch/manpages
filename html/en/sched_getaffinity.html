SCHED_SETAFFINITY(2)        Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual       SCHED_SETAFFINITY(2)



NAME
       sched_setaffinity, sched_getaffinity - set and get a process&apos;s CPU affin&#8208;
       ity mask

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;

       int sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                             cpu_set_t *mask);

       int sched_getaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                             cpu_set_t *mask);

DESCRIPTION
       A process&apos;s CPU affinity mask determines the set of CPUs on which  it  is
       eligible  to  run.   On a multiprocessor system, setting the CPU affinity
       mask can be used to obtain performance benefits.  For example,  by  dedi&#8208;
       cating  one  CPU to a particular process (i.e., setting the affinity mask
       of that process to specify a single CPU, and setting the affinity mask of
       all  other processes to exclude that CPU), it is possible to ensure maxi&#8208;
       mum execution speed for that process.  Restricting a process to run on  a
       single CPU also avoids the performance cost caused by the cache invalida&#8208;
       tion that occurs when a process ceases to execute on  one  CPU  and  then
       recommences execution on a different CPU.

       A  CPU  affinity  mask  is represented by the cpu_set_t structure, a &quot;CPU
       set&quot;, pointed to by mask.  A set of macros for manipulating CPU  sets  is
       described in CPU_SET(3).

       sched_setaffinity() sets the CPU affinity mask of the process whose ID is
       pid to the value specified by mask.  If pid is  zero,  then  the  calling
       process is used.  The argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the
       data pointed to by mask.  Normally this argument would  be  specified  as
       sizeof(cpu_set_t).

       If  the  process  specified by pid is not currently running on one of the
       CPUs specified in mask, then that process is migrated to one of the  CPUs
       specified in mask.

       sched_getaffinity()  writes  the affinity mask of the process whose ID is
       pid into the cpu_set_t structure pointed  to  by  mask.   The  cpusetsize
       argument specifies the size (in bytes) of mask.  If pid is zero, then the
       mask of the calling process is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_setaffinity() and  sched_getaffinity()  return  0.   On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT A supplied memory address was invalid.

       EINVAL The  affinity  bit  mask mask contains no processors that are cur&#8208;
              rently physically on the  system  and  permitted  to  the  process
              according  to any restrictions that may be imposed by the &quot;cpuset&quot;
              mechanism described in cpuset(7).

       EINVAL (sched_getaffinity() and, in kernels before 2.6.9, sched_setaffin&#8208;
              ity())  cpusetsize  is  smaller than the size of the affinity mask
              used by the kernel.

       EPERM  (sched_setaffinity()) The calling process does not have  appropri&#8208;
              ate  privileges.   The  caller needs an effective user ID equal to
              the real user ID or effective user ID of the process identified by
              pid, or it must possess the CAP_SYS_NICE capability.

       ESRCH  The process whose ID is pid could not be found.

VERSIONS
       The CPU affinity system calls were introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.8.  The
       system call wrappers were introduced in glibc 2.3.  Initially, the  glibc
       interfaces  included  a  cpusetsize  argument, typed as unsigned int.  In
       glibc 2.3.3, the cpusetsize argument was removed, but was  then  restored
       in glibc 2.3.4, with type size_t.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       After a call to sched_setaffinity(), the set of CPUs on which the process
       will actually run is the intersection of the set specified  in  the  mask
       argument  and the set of CPUs actually present on the system.  The system
       may further restrict the set of CPUs on which the  process  runs  if  the
       &quot;cpuset&quot;  mechanism described in cpuset(7) is being used.  These restric&#8208;
       tions on the actual set of  CPUs  on  which  the  process  will  run  are
       silently imposed by the kernel.

       sched_setscheduler(2) has a description of the Linux scheduling scheme.

       The affinity mask is actually a per-thread attribute that can be adjusted
       independently for each of the threads  in  a  thread  group.   The  value
       returned  from  a  call  to  gettid(2) can be passed in the argument pid.
       Specifying pid as 0 will set the attribute for the  calling  thread,  and
       passing  the  value  returned  from  a  call  to  getpid(2)  will set the
       attribute for the main thread of the thread group.  (If you are using the
       POSIX   threads   API,  then  use  pthread_setaffinity_np(3)  instead  of
       sched_setaffinity().)

       A child created via fork(2) inherits its parent&apos;s CPU affinity mask.  The
       affinity mask is preserved across an execve(2).

       This  manual  page  describes  the  glibc  interface for the CPU affinity
       calls.  The actual system call interface is slightly different, with  the
       mask  being typed as unsigned long *, reflecting the fact that the under&#8208;
       lying implementation of CPU sets is a simple bit mask.  On  success,  the
       raw  sched_getaffinity()  system  call returns the size (in bytes) of the
       cpumask_t data type that is used internally by the  kernel  to  represent
       the CPU set bit mask.
