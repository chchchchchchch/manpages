SCHED_GETCPU(3)             Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual            SCHED_GETCPU(3)



NAME
       sched_getcpu - determine CPU on which the calling thread is running

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;

       int sched_getcpu(void);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_getcpu()  returns the number of the CPU on which the calling thread
       is currently executing.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_getcpu() returns a nonnegative CPU number.   On  error,
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement getcpu(2).

VERSIONS
       This function is available since glibc 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       sched_getcpu() is glibc specific.

NOTES
       The call

           cpu = sched_getcpu();

       is equivalent to the following getcpu(2) call:

           int c, s;
           s = getcpu(&amp;c, NULL, NULL);
           cpu = (s == -1) ? s : c;

SEE ALSO
       getcpu(2)
