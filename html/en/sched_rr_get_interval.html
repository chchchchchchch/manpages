SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2)    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual   SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2)



NAME
       sched_rr_get_interval - get the SCHED_RR interval for the named process

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;

       int sched_rr_get_interval(pid_t pid, struct timespec * tp);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_rr_get_interval()  writes into the timespec structure pointed to by
       tp the round-robin time quantum for the process identified by  pid.   The
       specified process should be running under the SCHED_RR scheduling policy.

       The timespec structure has the following form:

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
           };

       If  pid is zero, the time quantum for the calling process is written into
       *tp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_rr_get_interval() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Problem with copying information to user space.

       EINVAL Invalid pid.

       ENOSYS The  system  call  is not yet implemented (only on rather old ker&#8208;
              nels).

       ESRCH  Could not find a process with the ID pid.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       POSIX  systems  on  which  sched_rr_get_interval()  is  available  define
       _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.

   Linux Notes
       POSIX  does  not  specify  any  mechanism for controlling the size of the
       round-robin time quantum.  Older Linux kernels  provide  a  (nonportable)
       method  of  doing  this.   The quantum can be controlled by adjusting the
       process&apos;s nice value (see setpriority(2)).  Assigning a  negative  (i.e.,
       high) nice value results in a longer quantum; assigning a positive (i.e.,
       low) nice value results in a shorter quantum.  The default quantum is 0.1
       seconds;  the degree to which changing the nice value affects the quantum
       has varied somewhat across kernel  versions.   Since  Linux  2.6.24,  the
       SCHED_RR quantum cannot be modified.
