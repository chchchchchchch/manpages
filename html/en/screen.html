SCREEN(1)                                                              SCREEN(1)



NAME
       screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation



SYNOPSIS
       screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ]
       screen -r [[pid.]tty[.host]]
       screen -r sessionowner/[[pid.]tty[.host]]



DESCRIPTION
       Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical termi&#8208;
       nal between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each  vir&#8208;
       tual  terminal  provides  the  functions  of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in
       addition, several control functions from the  ISO  6429  (ECMA  48,  ANSI
       X3.64)  and  ISO  2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
       multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for  each
       virtual  terminal  and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text
       regions between windows.

       When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it  (or
       the  specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use
       the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can create new
       (full-screen)  windows  with  other  programs  in  them  (including  more
       shells), kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn output  log&#8208;
       ging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view the scrollback
       history, switch between windows in whatever manner  you  wish,  etc.  All
       windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs
       continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even  when
       the  whole  screen  session is detached from the user&apos;s terminal.  When a
       program terminates, screen (per default) kills the window that  contained
       it.   If  this  window was in the foreground, the display switches to the
       previous window; if none are left, screen exits.

       Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current window.
       The  only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate
       a command to the window manager.  By default, each command begins with  a
       control-a  (abbreviated  C-a  from  now on), and is followed by one other
       keystroke.  The command character and all the key bindings can  be  fully
       customized to be anything you like, though they are always two characters
       in length.

       Screen does not understand the prefix &quot;C-&quot; to mean control.   Please  use
       the  caret  notation  (&quot;^A&quot;  instead  of  &quot;C-a&quot;) as arguments to e.g. the
       escape command or the -e option.  Screen  will  also  print  out  control
       characters in caret notation.

       The standard way to create a new window is to type &quot;C-a c&quot;.  This creates
       a new window running a shell and switches  to  that  window  immediately,
       regardless  of  the  state  of the process running in the current window.
       Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom  command  in  it  by
       first  binding  the  command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or at
       the &quot;C-a :&quot; command line) and then using it just like the  &quot;C-a  c&quot;  com&#8208;
       mand.  In addition, new windows can be created by running a command like:

              screen emacs prog.c

       from  a  shell  prompt within a previously created window.  This will not
       run another copy of screen, but will instead supply the command name  and
       its  arguments  to  the window manager (specified in the $STY environment
       variable) who will use it to create the new window.   The  above  example
       would start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch to its window. -
       Note that you cannot transport environment variables  from  the  invoking
       shell  to the application (emacs in this case), because it is forked from
       the parent screen process, not from the invoking shell.

       If &quot;/var/run/utmp&quot; is writable by screen, an appropriate record  will  be
       written to this file for each window, and removed when the window is ter&#8208;
       minated.  This is useful for working with &quot;talk&quot;,  &quot;script&quot;,  &quot;shutdown&quot;,
       &quot;rsend&quot;,  &quot;sccs&quot;  and  other  similar  programs that use the utmp file to
       determine who you are. As long as screen is active on your terminal,  the
       terminal&apos;s own record is removed from the utmp file. See also &quot;C-a L&quot;.



GETTING STARTED
       Before  you  begin  to  use screen you&apos;ll need to make sure you have cor&#8208;
       rectly selected your terminal type, just as you would for any other term&#8208;
       cap/terminfo program.  (You can do this by using tset for example.)

       If  you&apos;re  impatient  and  want  to get started without doing a lot more
       reading, you should remember this one command:  &quot;C-a  ?&quot;.   Typing  these
       two  characters  will display a list of the available screen commands and
       their bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in the section  &quot;DEFAULT  KEY
       BINDINGS&quot;.  The manual section &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; deals with the contents of
       your .screenrc.

       If your terminal is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal (it doesn&apos;t  allow  the
       last  position  on the screen to be updated without scrolling the screen)
       consider using a version of your terminal&apos;s termcap  that  has  automatic
       margins  turned  off.  This will ensure an accurate and optimal update of
       the screen in all circumstances. Most  terminals  nowadays  have  &quot;magic&quot;
       margins  (automatic  margins  plus usable last column). This is the VT100
       style type and perfectly suited for screen.   If  all  you&apos;ve  got  is  a
       &quot;true&quot;  auto-margin terminal screen will be content to use it, but updat&#8208;
       ing a character put into the last position on the screen may not be  pos&#8208;
       sible  until  the  screen  scrolls  or the character is moved into a safe
       position in some other way. This delay can be shortened by using a termi&#8208;
       nal with insert-character capability.



COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       Screen has the following command-line options:

       -a   include  all  capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each win&#8208;
            dow&apos;s termcap, even if screen must redraw parts of  the  display  in
            order to implement a function.

       -A   Adapt  the sizes of all windows to the size of the current terminal.
            By default, screen tries  to  restore  its  old  window  sizes  when
            attaching  to  resizable  terminals (those with &quot;WS&quot; in its descrip&#8208;
            tion, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).

       -c file
            override the default configuration file  from  &quot;$HOME/.screenrc&quot;  to
            file.

       -d|-D [pid.tty.host]
            does  not  start  screen,  but detaches the elsewhere running screen
            session. It has the same effect as typing &quot;C-a d&quot; from screen&apos;s con&#8208;
            trolling terminal. -D is the equivalent to the power detach key.  If
            no session can be detached, this option is ignored.  In  combination
            with the -r/-R option more powerful effects can be achieved:

       -d -r   Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
&#12;       -d -R   Reattach  a  session  and  if  necessary detach or even create it
               first.

       -d -RR  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use  the
               first session if more than one session is available.

       -D -r   Reattach  a  session.  If  necessary  detach  and logout remotely
               first.

       -D -R   Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session  is  run&#8208;
               ning,  then  reattach.  If  necessary  detach and logout remotely
               first.  If it was not running create it and notify the user. This
               is the author&apos;s favorite.

       -D -RR  Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.

            Note:  It is always a good idea to check the status of your sessions
            by means of &quot;screen -list&quot;.

       -e xy
            specifies the command character to be x and the character generating
            a literal command character to y (when typed after the command char&#8208;
            acter).  The default is &quot;C-a&quot; and `a&apos;, which  can  be  specified  as
            &quot;-e^Aa&quot;.   When  creating  a  screen  session,  this option sets the
            default command character. In a multiuser session  all  users  added
            will start off with this command character. But when attaching to an
            already running session, this option changes only the command  char&#8208;
            acter  of  the  attaching user.  This option is equivalent to either
            the commands &quot;defescape&quot; or &quot;escape&quot; respectively.

       -f, -fn, and -fa
            turns flow-control on, off, or &quot;automatic switching mode&quot;.  This can
            also be defined through the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command.

       -h num
            Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be num lines high.

       -i   will  cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display
            immediately when flow-control is on.  See  the  &quot;defflow&quot;  .screenrc
            command for details.  The use of this option is discouraged.

       -l and -ln
            turns  login  mode on or off (for /var/run/utmp updating).  This can
            also be defined through the &quot;deflogin&quot; .screenrc command.

       -ls [match]
       -list [match]
            does not start screen, but prints a list of pid.tty.host strings and
            creation  timestamps  identifying  your  screen  sessions.  Sessions
            marked `detached&apos; can be resumed  with  &quot;screen  -r&quot;.  Those  marked
            `attached&apos;  are running and have a controlling terminal. If the ses&#8208;
            sion runs in multiuser mode, it is marked `multi&apos;.  Sessions  marked
            as  `unreachable&apos; either live on a different host or are `dead&apos;.  An
            unreachable session is considered dead, when its name matches either
            the name of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any.  See
            the -r flag for a description how to  construct  matches.   Sessions
            marked as `dead&apos; should be thoroughly checked and removed.  Ask your
            system administrator if you are not sure. Remove sessions  with  the
            -wipe option.

       -L   tells screen to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.

       -m   causes  screen to ignore the $STY environment variable. With &quot;screen
            -m&quot; creation of a new session is enforced, regardless whether screen
            is called from within another screen session or not. This flag has a
            special meaning in connection with the `-d&apos; option:
&#12;       -d -m   Start screen in &quot;detached&quot; mode. This creates a new  session  but
               doesn&apos;t attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.

       -D -m   This  also  starts  screen in &quot;detached&quot; mode, but doesn&apos;t fork a
               new process. The command exits if the session terminates.

       -O   selects a more optimal output mode for  your  terminal  rather  than
            true  VT100  emulation  (only  affects auto-margin terminals without
            `LP&apos;).  This can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP&apos; in
            a &quot;termcap&quot; command.

       -p number_or_name|-|=|+
            Preselect  a  window.  This is useful when you want to reattach to a
            specific window or you want to send a command via the &quot;-X&quot; option to
            a  specific window. As with screen&apos;s select command, &quot;-&quot; selects the
            blank window. As a special case for reattach, &quot;=&quot; brings up the win&#8208;
            dowlist  on  the blank window, while a &quot;+&quot; will create a new window.
            The command will not be executed if the specified window  could  not
            be found.

       -q   Suppress  printing  of error messages. In combination with &quot;-ls&quot; the
            exit value is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without  sessions.
            10  indicates  a directory with running but not attachable sessions.
            11 (or more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.  In  combination
            with  &quot;-r&quot;  the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates that there is
            no session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there  are  2  (or
            more) sessions to resume and you should specify which one to choose.
            In all other cases &quot;-q&quot; has no effect.

       -Q   Some commands now can be queried from a remote  session  using  this
            flag,  e.g. &quot;screen -Q windows&quot;. The commands will send the response
            to the stdout of the querying process. If there was an error in  the
            command, then the querying process will exit with a non-zero status.

            The commands that can be queried now are:
             echo
             info
             lastmsg
             number
             select
             time
             title
             windows

       -r [pid.tty.host]
       -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host]
            resumes  a detached screen session.  No other options (except combi&#8208;
            nations with -d/-D) may be specified, though an optional  prefix  of
            [pid.]tty.host   may  be  needed  to  distinguish  between  multiple
            detached screen sessions.  The second form is  used  to  connect  to
            another  user&apos;s  screen  session  which runs in multiuser mode. This
            indicates that screen should look for  sessions  in  another  user&apos;s
            directory. This requires setuid-root.

       -R   attempts to resume the youngest (in terms of creation time) detached
            screen session it finds.   If  successful,  all  other  command-line
            options  are  ignored.   If no detached session exists, starts a new
            session using the specified options, just as  if  -R  had  not  been
            specified. The option is set by default if screen is run as a login-
            shell (actually screen uses &quot;-xRR&quot; in that case).  For  combinations
            with the -d/-D option see there.  Note: Time-based session selection
            is a Debian addition.

       -s program
            sets the default shell to the  program  specified,  instead  of  the
            value  in  the  environment  variable  $SHELL  (or  &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if not
            defined).  This can also be defined through  the  &quot;shell&quot;  .screenrc
            command.

       -S sessionname
            When  creating  a  new session, this option can be used to specify a
            meaningful name for the session. This name  identifies  the  session
            for  &quot;screen  -list&quot;  and  &quot;screen  -r&quot;  actions. It substitutes the
            default [tty.host] suffix.

       -t name
            sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified  program.
            See also the &quot;shelltitle&quot; .screenrc command.

       -T term
            Set the $TERM environment varible using the spcified term as opposed
            to the defualt setting of screen.

       -U   Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your  termi&#8208;
            nal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the
            default encoding for new windows to `utf8&apos;.

       -v   Print version number.

       -wipe [match]
            does the same  as  &quot;screen  -ls&quot;,  but  removes  destroyed  sessions
            instead  of  marking them as `dead&apos;.  An unreachable session is con&#8208;
            sidered dead, when its name matches either the  name  of  the  local
            host,  or  the  explicitly given parameter, if any.  See the -r flag
            for a description how to construct matches.

       -x   Attach to a not  detached  screen  session.  (Multi  display  mode).
            Screen  refuses  to  attach  from within itself.  But when cascading
            multiple screens, loops are not detected; take care.

       -X   Send the specified command to a running screen session. You can  use
            the  -d  or  -r  option  to tell screen to look only for attached or
            detached screen sessions. Note that this command doesn&apos;t work if the
            session is password protected.

       -4   Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses.

       -6   Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses.


DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
       As  mentioned,  each  screen  command consists of a &quot;C-a&quot; followed by one
       other character.  For your convenience, all commands that  are  bound  to
       lower-case letters are also bound to their control character counterparts
       (with the exception of &quot;C-a a&quot;; see below), thus, &quot;C-a c&quot; as well as &quot;C-a
       C-c&quot;  can  be  used to create a window. See section &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; for a
       description of the command.

       The following table shows the default key bindings:

       C-a &apos;       (select)      Prompt for a window name or  number  to  switch
                                 to.

       C-a &quot;       (windowlist -b)
                                 Present a list of all windows for selection.

       C-a 0       (select 0)
        &#226;&#166;            &#226;&#166;
       C-a 9       (select 9)
       C-a -       (select -)    Switch  to window number 0 - 9, or to the blank
                                 window.

       C-a tab     (focus)       Switch the input focus to the next region.  See
                                 also split, remove, only.

       C-a C-a     (other)       Toggle  to  the  window  displayed  previously.
                                 Note that this binding defaults to the  command
                                 character  typed twice, unless overridden.  For
                                 instance, if you use the  option  &quot;-e]x&quot;,  this
                                 command becomes &quot;]]&quot;.

       C-a a       (meta)        Send the command character (C-a) to window. See
                                 escape command.

       C-a A       (title)       Allow the user to enter a name for the  current
                                 window.

       C-a b
       C-a C-b     (break)       Send a break to window.

       C-a B       (pow_break)   Reopen the terminal line and send a break.

       C-a c
       C-a C-c     (screen)      Create  a new window with a shell and switch to
                                 that window.

       C-a C       (clear)       Clear the screen.

       C-a d
       C-a C-d     (detach)      Detach screen from this terminal.

       C-a D D     (pow_detach)  Detach and logout.

       C-a f
       C-a C-f     (flow)        Toggle flow on, off or auto.

       C-a F       (fit)         Resize the window to the current region size.

       C-a C-g     (vbell)       Toggles screen&apos;s visual bell mode.

       C-a h       (hardcopy)    Write a hardcopy of the current window  to  the
                                 file &quot;hardcopy.n&quot;.

       C-a H       (log)         Begins/ends  logging  of  the current window to
                                 the file &quot;screenlog.n&quot;.

       C-a i

CUSTOMIZATION
       The &quot;socket directory&quot; defaults either  to  $HOME/.screen  or  simply  to
       /tmp/screens  or preferably to /var/run/screen chosen at compile-time. If
       screen is installed setuid-root, then the  administrator  should  compile
       screen  with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If screen is
       not running setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700  directory  in
       the environment variable $SCREENDIR.

       When  screen  is  invoked,  it  executes initialization commands from the
       files &quot;/etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;.screenrc&quot; in the user&apos;s home directory. These
       are  the  &quot;programmer&apos;s defaults&quot; that can be overridden in the following
       ways: for the global screenrc file screen searches  for  the  environment
       variable  $SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may be disabled at compile-
       time). The user specific screenrc file is  searched  in  $SCREENRC,  then
       $HOME/.screenrc.   The  command  line option -c takes precedence over the
       above user screenrc files.

       Commands in these files are used to set options, bind functions to  keys,
       and  to  automatically  establish one or more windows at the beginning of
       your screen session.  Commands are listed one per line, with empty  lines
       being  ignored.   A  command&apos;s arguments are separated by tabs or spaces,
       and may be surrounded by single or double quotes.  A `#&apos; turns  the  rest
       of  the  line into a comment, except in quotes.  Unintelligible lines are
       warned about and ignored.  Commands may contain references to environment
       variables.  The  syntax  is the shell-like &quot;$VAR &quot; or &quot;${VAR}&quot;. Note that
       this causes incompatibility with previous screen  versions,  as  now  the
       &apos;$&apos;-character  has  to  be protected with &apos;\&apos; if no variable substitution
       shall be performed. A string in  single-quotes  is  also  protected  from
       variable substitution.

       Two  configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen distri&#8208;
       bution: &quot;etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;etc/etcscreenrc&quot;. They contain  a  number  of
       useful examples for various commands.

       Customization  can also be done &apos;on-line&apos;. To enter the command mode type
       `C-a :&apos;. Note that commands starting with &quot;def&quot;  change  default  values,
       while others change current settings.

       The following commands are available:

       acladd usernames [crypted-pw]
       addacl usernames

       Enable  users  to  fully access this screen session. Usernames can be one
       user or a comma separated list of users. This command enables  to  attach
       to  the  screen  session and performs the equivalent of `aclchg usernames
       +rwx &quot;#?&quot;&apos;.  executed. To add a user  with  restricted  access,  use  the
       `aclchg&apos;  command below.  If an optional second parameter is supplied, it
       should be a crypted password for the named user(s). `Addacl&apos; is a synonym
       to `acladd&apos;.  Multi user mode only.

       aclchg usernames permbits list
       chacl usernames permbits list

       Change  permissions  for a comma separated list of users. Permission bits
       are represented as `r&apos;, `w&apos; and `x&apos;. Prefixing `+&apos; grants the permission,
       `-&apos; removes it. The third parameter is a comma separated list of commands
       and/or windows (specified either by number or title).  The  special  list
       `#&apos;  refers to all windows, `?&apos; to all commands. if usernames consists of
       a single `*&apos;, all known users are affected.  A command  can  be  executed
       when  the user has the `x&apos; bit for it.  The user can type input to a win&#8208;
       dow when he has its `w&apos; bit set and no other user obtains a writelock for
       this  window.   Other bits are currently ignored.  To withdraw the write&#8208;
       lock from another user in window 2: `aclchg username -w+w 2&apos;.   To  allow
       read-only  access  to the session: `aclchg username -w &quot;#&quot;&apos;. As soon as a
       user&apos;s name is known to screen he can attach  to  the  session  and  (per
       default) has full permissions for all command and windows. Execution per&#8208;
       mission for the acl commands, `at&apos; and others should also be  removed  or
       the  user  may be able to regain write permission.  Rights of the special
       username nobody cannot be changed (see the &quot;su&quot; command).  `Chacl&apos;  is  a
       synonym to `aclchg&apos;.  Multi user mode only.

       acldel username

       Remove  a  user from screen&apos;s access control list. If currently attached,
       all the user&apos;s displays are detached from the session. He  cannot  attach
       again.  Multi user mode only.

       aclgrp username [groupname]

       Creates  groups of users that share common access rights. The name of the
       group is the username of the group  leader.  Each  member  of  the  group
       inherits  the  permissions  that  are  granted  to the group leader. That
       means, if a user fails an access check, another check  is  made  for  the
       group leader.  A user is removed from all groups the special value &quot;none&quot;
       is used for groupname.  If the second parameter is omitted all groups the
       user is in are listed.

       aclumask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits &#226;&#166;. ]
       umask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits &#226;&#166;. ]

       This  specifies  the access other users have to windows that will be cre&#8208;
       ated by the caller of the command.  Users may be no, one or a comma sepa&#8208;
       rated  list  of known usernames. If no users are specified, a list of all
       currently known users is assumed.  Bits is any combination of access con&#8208;
       trol bits allowed defined with the &quot;aclchg&quot; command. The special username
       &quot;?&quot; predefines the access that not yet known users will be granted to any
       window  initially.   The special username &quot;??&quot; predefines the access that
       not yet known users are granted to any command.  Rights  of  the  special
       username  nobody  cannot be changed (see the &quot;su&quot; command).  `Umask&apos; is a
       synonym to `aclumask&apos;.

       activity message

       When any activity occurs in a background window that is being  monitored,
       screen  displays  a  notification  in the message line.  The notification
       message can be re-defined by  means  of  the  &quot;activity&quot;  command.   Each
       occurrence  of  `%&apos; in message is replaced by the number of the window in
       which activity has occurred, and each occurrence of `^G&apos; is  replaced  by
       the  definition  for bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell).  The
       default message is

                   &apos;Activity in window %n&apos;

       Note that monitoring is off for  all  windows  by  default,  but  can  be
       altered by use of the &quot;monitor&quot; command (C-a M).

       allpartial on|off

       If set to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed on window change.
       This affects all windows and is useful for slow terminal lines. The  pre&#8208;
       vious  setting  of  full/partial refresh for each window is restored with
       &quot;allpartial off&quot;.  This is a global flag that immediately takes effect on
       all  windows  overriding  the  &quot;partial&quot; settings. It does not change the
       default redraw behavior of newly created windows.

       altscreen on|off

       If set to on, &quot;alternate screen&quot; support is enabled in virtual terminals,
       just like in xterm.  Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       at [identifier][#|*|%] command [args &#226;&#166; ]

       Execute  a command at other displays or windows as if it had been entered
       there.  &quot;At&quot; changes the context (the `current window&apos; or  `current  dis&#8208;
       play&apos;  setting)  of  the command. If the first parameter describes a non-
       unique context, the command will be executed multiple times. If the first
       parameter is of the form `identifier*&apos; then identifier is matched against
       user names.  The command  is  executed  once  for  each  display  of  the
       selected  user(s).  If  the  first parameter is of the form `identifier%&apos;
       identifier is matched against displays. Displays are named after the ttys
       they  attach.  The  prefix  `/dev/&apos; or `/dev/tty&apos; may be omitted from the
       identifier.  If identifier has a `#&apos; or nothing appended  it  is  matched
       against window numbers and titles. Omitting an identifier in front of the
       `#&apos;, `*&apos; or `%&apos;-character selects all users, displays or windows  because
       a prefix-match is performed. Note that on the affected display(s) a short
       message will describe what happened. Permission is checked for  initiator
       of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the owners of the affected display(s).  Note
       that the &apos;#&apos; character works as a comment introducer when it is  preceded
       by  whitespace.  This  can  be escaped by prefixing a &apos;\&apos;.  Permission is
       checked for the initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the owners of  the
       affected display(s).
       Caveat:  When  matching against windows, the command is executed at least
       once per window. Commands that change the internal arrangement of windows
       (like &quot;other&quot;) may be called again. In shared windows the command will be
       repeated for each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle  commands
       like  &quot;login&quot;!   Some commands (e.g. &quot;process&quot;) require that a display is
       associated with the target windows.  These commands  may  not  work  cor&#8208;
       rectly under &quot;at&quot; looping over windows.

       attrcolor attrib [attribute/color-modifier]

       This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the color of
       the  text.  If  the  attribute  attrib   is   in   use,   the   specified
       attribute/color  modifier  is  also applied. If no modifier is given, the
       current one is deleted. See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for  the  syntax
       of the modifier. Screen understands two pseudo-attributes, &quot;i&quot; stands for
       high-intensity foreground color and  &quot;I&quot;  for  high-intensity  background
       color.

       Examples:

              attrcolor b &quot;R&quot;

       Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed.

              attrcolor u &quot;-u b&quot;

       Use blue text instead of underline.

              attrcolor b &quot;.I&quot;

       Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do this already.

              attrcolor i &quot;+b&quot;

       Make bright colored text also bold.

       autodetach on|off

       Sets  whether  screen  will automatically detach upon hangup, which saves
       all your running programs until they are resumed with a  screen  -r  com&#8208;
       mand.  When turned off, a hangup signal will terminate screen and all the
       processes it contains. Autodetach is on by default.

       autonuke on|off

       Sets whether a clear screen sequence should nuke all the output that  has
       not been written to the terminal. See also &quot;obuflimit&quot;.

       backtick id lifespan autorefresh cmd args&#226;&#166;
       backtick id

       Program  the  backtick  command  with the numerical id id.  The output of
       such a command is used for substitution of the &quot;%`&quot;  string  escape.  The
       specified  lifespan  is  the  number  of seconds the output is considered
       valid. After this time, the command  is  run  again  if  a  corresponding
       string  escape  is  encountered.   The  autorefresh parameter triggers an
       automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after the  specified
       number of seconds. Only the last line of output is used for substitution.
       If  both  the lifespan and the autorefresh parameters are zero, the back&#8208;
       tick program is expected to stay in the background  and  generate  output
       once  in  a  while.  In this case, the command is executed right away and
       screen stores the last line of output. If a new line gets printed  screen
       will automatically refresh the hardstatus or the captions.
       The  second  form  of  the  command deletes the backtick command with the
       numerical id id.

       bce [on|off]

       Change background-color-erase setting. If &quot;bce&quot; is set to on, all charac&#8208;
       ters  cleared by an erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will be displayed
       in the current background color. Otherwise the default  background  color
       is used.

       bell_msg [message]

       When  a  bell character is sent to a background window, screen displays a
       notification in the message line.  The notification message  can  be  re-
       defined  by  this command.  Each occurrence of `%&apos; in message is replaced
       by the number of the window to which a  bell  has  been  sent,  and  each
       occurrence of `^G&apos; is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap
       (usually an audible bell).  The default message is

                   &apos;Bell in window %n&apos;

       An empty message can be supplied to the &quot;bell_msg&quot;  command  to  suppress
       output  of  a message line (bell_msg &quot;&quot;).  Without parameter, the current
       message is shown.

       bind [-c class] key [command [args]]

       Bind a command to a key.  By default, most of the  commands  provided  by
       screen  are  bound  to  one or more keys as indicated in the &quot;DEFAULT KEY
       BINDINGS&quot; section, e.g. the command to create a new window  is  bound  to
       &quot;C-c&quot;  and &quot;c&quot;.  The &quot;bind&quot; command can be used to redefine the key bind&#8208;
       ings and to define new bindings.  The key argument  is  either  a  single
       character,  a  two-character sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C-x&quot;), a
       backslash followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code  of  the
       character),  or  a backslash followed by a second character, such as &quot;\^&quot;
       or &quot;\\&quot;.  The argument can also be quoted, if you like.   If  no  further
       argument  is  given,  any  previously established binding for this key is
       removed.  The command argument can be any command listed in this section.

       If a command class is specified via the &quot;-c&quot; option, the key is bound for
       the  specified class. Use the &quot;command&quot; command to activate a class. Com&#8208;
       mand classes can be used to create multiple command keys or multi-charac&#8208;
       ter bindings.

       Some examples:

                   bind &apos; &apos; windows
                   bind ^k
                   bind k
                   bind K kill
                   bind ^f screen telnet foobar
                   bind \033 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su

       would  bind  the space key to the command that displays a list of windows
       (so that the command usually invoked by &quot;C-a C-w&quot; would also be available
       as  &quot;C-a  space&quot;).  The  next three lines remove the default kill binding
       from &quot;C-a C-k&quot; and &quot;C-a k&quot;.  &quot;C-a K&quot; is then bound to the  kill  command.
       Then it binds &quot;C-f&quot; to the command &quot;create a window with a TELNET connec&#8208;
       tion to foobar&quot;, and bind &quot;escape&quot; to the command that  creates  an  non-
       login  window with a.k.a. &quot;root&quot; in slot #9, with a superuser shell and a
       scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.

                   bind -c demo1 0 select 10
                   bind -c demo1 1 select 11
                   bind -c demo1 2 select 12
                   bindkey &quot;^B&quot; command -c demo1

       makes &quot;C-b 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-b 1&quot; window 11, etc.

                   bind -c demo2 0 select 10
                   bind -c demo2 1 select 11
                   bind -c demo2 2 select 12
                   bind - command -c demo2

       makes &quot;C-a - 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-a - 1&quot; window 11, etc.

       bindkey [-d] [-m] [-a] [[-k|-t] string [cmd args]]

       This command manages screen&apos;s input translation tables.  Every  entry  in
       one  of  the  tables  tells  screen how to react if a certain sequence of
       characters is encountered. There are three tables: one that  should  con&#8208;
       tain actions programmed by the user, one for the default actions used for
       terminal emulation and one for screen&apos;s copy mode to do cursor  movement.
       See section &quot;INPUT TRANSLATION&quot; for a list of default key bindings.
       If the -d option is given, bindkey modifies the default table, -m changes
       the copy mode table and with neither option the user table  is  selected.
       The  argument  string is the sequence of characters to which an action is
       bound. This can either be a fixed string or a termcap keyboard capability
       name (selectable with the -k option).
       Some  keys on a VT100 terminal can send a different string if application
       mode is turned on (e.g the cursor keys).  Such keys have two  entries  in
       the translation table. You can select the application mode entry by spec&#8208;
       ifying the -a option.
       The -t option tells screen not to do inter-character timing.  One  cannot
       turn off the timing if a termcap capability is used.
       Cmd can be any of screen&apos;s commands with an arbitrary number of args.  If
       cmd is omitted the key-binding is removed from the table.
       Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:

               bindkey -d
       Show all of the default key bindings. The application  mode  entries  are
       marked with [A].

               bindkey -k k1 select 1
       Make the &quot;F1&quot; key switch to window one.

               bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo
       Make  &quot;foo&quot;  an abbreviation of the word &quot;barfoo&quot;. Timeout is disabled so
       that users can type slowly.

               bindkey &quot;\024&quot; mapdefault
       This key-binding makes &quot;^T&quot; an escape character for key-bindings. If  you
       did  the  above  &quot;stuff  barfoo&quot; binding, you can enter the word &quot;foo&quot; by
       typing &quot;^Tfoo&quot;. If you want to insert a &quot;^T&quot; you have to  press  the  key
       twice (i.e., escape the escape binding).

               bindkey -k F1 command
       Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape (besides ^A).

       break [duration]

       Send  a  break signal for duration*0.25 seconds to this window.  For non-
       Posix systems the time interval may be rounded up to full seconds.   Most
       useful  if  a  character  device  is attached to the window rather than a
       shell process (See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;). The maximum duration  of
       a break signal is limited to 15 seconds.

       blanker

       Activate  the  screen blanker. First the screen is cleared. If no blanker
       program is defined, the cursor is turned off, otherwise, the  program  is
       started  and it&apos;s output is written to the screen.  The screen blanker is
       killed with the first keypress, the read key is discarded.
       This command is normally used together with the &quot;idle&quot; command.

       blankerprg [program args]

       Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program if an empty argu&#8208;
       ment  is  given.  Shows the currently set blanker program if no arguments
       are given.

       breaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK |TCSBRK]

       Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal for ter&#8208;
       minal  devices.  This command should affect the current window only.  But
       it still behaves identical to &quot;defbreaktype&quot;. This will be changed in the
       future.   Calling &quot;breaktype&quot; with no parameter displays the break method
       for the current window.

       bufferfile [exchange-file]

       Change the filename used for reading and writing with the  paste  buffer.
       If  the  optional  argument  to  the &quot;bufferfile&quot; command is omitted, the
       default setting (&quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;) is reactivated.   The  following
       example  will  paste  the  system&apos;s  password file into the screen window
       (using the paste buffer, where a copy remains):

                   C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd
                   C-a &lt; C-a ]
                   C-a : bufferfile

       c1 [on|off]

       Change c1 code processing. &quot;C1 on&quot; tells screen to treat the input  char&#8208;
       acters  between  128 and 159 as control functions.  Such an 8-bit code is
       normally the same as ESC followed by the corresponding  7-bit  code.  The
       default  setting  is  to  process  c1  codes  and can be changed with the
       &quot;defc1&quot; command.  Users with fonts that have usable characters in the  c1
       positions may want to turn this off.

       caption always|splitonly [string]
       caption string [string]

       This command controls the display of the window captions. Normally a cap&#8208;
       tion is only used if more than one window is shown on the display  (split
       screen  mode).  But  if  the type is set to always screen shows a caption
       even if only one window is displayed. The default is splitonly.

       The second form changes the text used for the caption. You  can  use  all
       escapes  from the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a default of `%3n
       %t&apos;.

       You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional argument.

       charset set

       Change the current character set slot designation  and  charset  mapping.
       The  first four character of set are treated as charset designators while
       the fifth and sixth character must be in range &apos;0&apos; to  &apos;3&apos;  and  set  the
       GL/GR  charset  mapping.  On every position a &apos;.&apos; may be used to indicate
       that the corresponding charset/mapping should  not  be  changed  (set  is
       padded to six characters internally by appending &apos;.&apos;  chars). New windows
       have &quot;BBBB02&quot; as default charset, unless a &quot;encoding&quot; command is active.
       The current setting can be viewed with the &quot;info&quot; command.

       chdir [directory]

       Change the current directory of screen to the specified directory or,  if
       called  without  an  argument,  to  your home directory (the value of the
       environment variable $HOME).  All windows that are created  by  means  of
       the &quot;screen&quot; command from within &quot;.screenrc&quot; or by means of &quot;C-a : screen
       &#226;&#166;&quot; or &quot;C-a c&quot; use this as their default directory.  Without a chdir com&#8208;
       mand,  this  would be the directory from which screen was invoked.  Hard&#8208;
       copy and log files are always written to the window&apos;s default  directory,
       not  the current directory of the process running in the window.  You can
       use this command multiple times in your .screenrc to start  various  win&#8208;
       dows  in  different  default  directories,  but the last chdir value will
       affect all the windows you create interactively.

       clear

       Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback buffer.

       colon [prefix]

       Allows you to enter &quot;.screenrc&quot; command lines. Useful for on-the-fly mod&#8208;
       ification  of  key  bindings,  specific window creation and changing set&#8208;
       tings. Note that the &quot;set&quot; keyword no  longer  exists!  Usually  commands
       affect  the  current  window rather than default settings for future win&#8208;
       dows. Change defaults with commands starting with &apos;def&#226;&#166;&apos;.

       If you consider this as the `Ex command mode&apos; of screen, you  may  regard
       &quot;C-a esc&quot; (copy mode) as its `Vi command mode&apos;.

       command [-c class]

       This  command  has  the same effect as typing the screen escape character
       (^A). It is probably only useful for key bindings.  If the &quot;-c&quot; option is
       given,  select  the  specified command class.  See also &quot;bind&quot; and &quot;bind&#8208;
       key&quot;.

       compacthist [on|off]

       This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines when scrolling
       up text into the history buffer.

       console [on|off]

       Grabs  or  un-grabs  the machines console output to a window.  Note: Only
       the owner of /dev/console can grab the console output.  This  command  is
       only available if the machine supports the ioctl TIOCCONS.

       copy

       Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text from the current
       window and its history into the paste buffer.  In  this  mode  a  vi-like
       `full screen editor&apos; is active:
       Movement keys:
         h, C-h, or left arrow move the cursor left.
         j, C-n, or down arrow move the cursor down.
         k, C-p, or up arrow move the cursor up.
         l (&apos;el&apos;) or right arrow move the cursor right.
         0 (zero) or C-a move to the leftmost column.
         + and - positions one line up and down.
         H, M and L move the cursor to the leftmost column of the top, center or
           bottom line of the window.
         | moves to the specified absolute column.
         g or home moves to the beginning of the buffer.
         G or end moves to the specified absolute line (default: end of buffer).
         % jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer.
         ^ or $ move to the leftmost column, to the first or last non-whitespace
           character on the line.
         w, b, and e move the cursor word by word.
         B, E move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi).
         f/F,  t/T move the cursor forward/backward to the next occurence of the
           target. (eg, &apos;3fy&apos; will move the cursor to the 3rd &apos;y&apos; to the right.)
         ; and , Repeat the last f/F/t/T command in the same/opposite direction.
         C-e and C-y scroll the display up/down by one line while preserving the
           cursor position.
         C-u and C-d scroll the display up/down by the specified amount of lines
           while preserving the cursor position. (Default: half screen-full).
         C-b and C-f scroll the display up/down a full screen.

       Note:
           Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a  .screenrc  command.
           (E.g. markkeys &quot;h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot;) There is no simple method for a full
           emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-character codes.

       Marking:
           The copy range is specified by setting two marks.  The  text  between
           these marks will be highlighted. Press:
         space  or enter to set the first or second mark respectively. If mouse&#8208;
           track is set to `on&apos;, marks can also be set using left mouse click.
         Y and y used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of line.
         W marks exactly one word.
       Repeat count:
           Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count  number  by
           pressing digits
         0..9 which is taken as a repeat count.
           Example: &quot;C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y&quot; will copy lines 11 to 15 into the paste
           buffer.
       Searching:
         / Vi-like search forward.
         ? Vi-like search backward.
         C-a s Emacs style incremental search forward.
         C-r Emacs style reverse i-search.
         n Find next search pattern.
         N Find previous search pattern.
       Specials:
           There are however some keys that act differently than in vi.  Vi does
           not  allow  one  to yank rectangular blocks of text, but screen does.
           Press:
         c or C to set the left or right margin respectively. If no repeat count
           is given, both default to the current cursor position.
           Example: Try this on a rather full text screen: &quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE c
           10 l 5 j C SPACE&quot;.

           This moves one to the middle line of the screen, moves in 20  columns
           left,  marks the beginning of the paste buffer, sets the left column,
           moves 5 columns down, sets the right column, and then marks  the  end
           of the paste buffer. Now try:
           &quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE&quot;

           and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.
         J joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated by a newline
           character (012), lines glued seamless, lines separated  by  a  single
           whitespace  and  comma separated lines. Note that you can prepend the
           newline character with a carriage  return  character,  by  issuing  a
           &quot;crlf on&quot;.
         v  or  V  is  for all the vi users with &quot;:set numbers&quot; - it toggles the
           left margin between column 9 and 1. Press
         a before the final space key to toggle in append mode.  Thus  the  con&#8208;
           tents  of  the  paste buffer will not be overwritten, but is appended
           to.
         A toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark.
         &gt; sets the (second) mark and writes the contents of the paste buffer to
           the  screen-exchange  file  (/tmp/screen-exchange  per  default) once
           copy-mode is finished.
           This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer  to
           that file: &quot;C-A [ g SPACE G $ &gt;&quot;.
         C-g gives information about the current line and column.
         x  or  o  exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position. You
           can use this to adjust an already placed mark.
         C-l (&apos;el&apos;) will redraw the screen.
         @ does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode.
         All keys not described here exit copy mode.

       copy_reg [key]

       No longer exists, use &quot;readreg&quot; instead.

       crlf [on|off]

       This affects the copying of text regions with the `C-a [&apos; command. If  it
       is  set  to  `on&apos;,  lines will be separated by the two character sequence
       `CR&apos; - `LF&apos;.  Otherwise (default) only `LF&apos; is used.  When  no  parameter
       is given, the state is toggled.

       debug on|off

       Turns  runtime  debugging  on  or  off.  If screen has been compiled with
       option -DDEBUG debugging available and is turned  on  per  default.  Note
       that  this  command  only affects debugging output from the main &quot;SCREEN&quot;
       process correctly. Debug output  from  attacher  processes  can  only  be
       turned off once and forever.

       defc1 on|off

       Same as the c1 command except that the default setting for new windows is
       changed. Initial setting is `on&apos;.

       defautonuke on|off

       Same as the autonuke command except that the default setting for new dis&#8208;
       plays  is  changed.  Initial setting is `off&apos;.  Note that you can use the
       special `AN&apos; terminal capability if you want to have a dependency on  the
       terminal type.

       defbce on|off

       Same  as  the bce command except that the default setting for new windows
       is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defbreaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK |TCSBRK]

       Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal for ter&#8208;
       minal  devices.  The preferred methods are tcsendbreak and TIOCSBRK.  The
       third, TCSBRK, blocks the complete screen session for the duration of the
       break,  but  it may be the only way to generate long breaks.  Tcsendbreak
       and TIOCSBRK may or may not produce long breaks with spikes (e.g.  4  per
       second).  This  is  not  only system-dependent, this also differs between
       serial board drivers.  Calling &quot;defbreaktype&quot; with no parameter  displays
       the current setting.

       defcharset [set]

       Like  the charset command except that the default setting for new windows
       is changed. Shows current default if called without argument.

       defescape xy

       Set the default command characters. This is equivalent  to  the  &quot;escape&quot;
       except  that it is useful multiuser sessions only. In a multiuser session
       &quot;escape&quot; changes  the  command  character  of  the  calling  user,  where
       &quot;defescape&quot; changes the default command characters for users that will be
       added later.

       defflow on|off|auto [interrupt]

       Same as the flow command except that the default setting for new  windows
       is  changed.  Initial setting is `auto&apos;.  Specifying &quot;defflow auto inter&#8208;
       rupt&quot; is the same as the command-line options -fa and -i.

       defgr on|off

       Same as the gr command except that the default setting for new windows is
       changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defhstatus [status]

       The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set to status.  This
       command is useful to make the hardstatus of every window display the win&#8208;
       dow  number or title or the like.  Status may contain the same directives
       as in the window messages, but the directive  escape  character  is  &apos;^E&apos;
       (octal 005) instead of &apos;%&apos;.  This was done to make a misinterpretation of
       program generated hardstatus lines impossible.  If the  parameter  status
       is  omitted,  the  current  default string is displayed.  Per default the
       hardstatus line of new windows is empty.

       defencoding enc

       Same as the encoding command except that the default setting for new win&#8208;
       dows is changed. Initial setting is the encoding taken from the terminal.

       deflog on|off

       Same  as  the log command except that the default setting for new windows
       is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       deflogin on|off

       Same as the login command except that the default setting for new windows
       is  changed.  This  is  initialized  with  `on&apos;  as distributed (see con&#8208;
       fig.h.in).

       defmode mode

       The mode of each newly allocated pseudo-tty is set to mode.  Mode  is  an
       octal number.  When no &quot;defmode&quot; command is given, mode 0622 is used.

       defmonitor on|off

       Same  as the monitor command except that the default setting for new win&#8208;
       dows is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defmousetrack on|off

       Same as the mousetrack command except that the default  setting  for  new
       windows is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defnonblock on|off|numsecs

       Same as the nonblock command except that the default setting for displays
       is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defobuflimit limit

       Same as the obuflimit command except that the  default  setting  for  new
       displays is changed. Initial setting is 256 bytes.  Note that you can use
       the special &apos;OL&apos; terminal capability if you want to have a dependency  on
       the terminal type.

       defscrollback num

       Same  as  the  scrollback command except that the default setting for new
       windows is changed. Initial setting is 100.

       defshell command

       Synonym to the shell command. See there.
&#12;       defsilence on|off

       Same as the silence command except that the default setting for new  win&#8208;
       dows is changed. Initial setting is `off&apos;.

       defslowpaste msec&quot;

       Same  as  the  slowpaste  command except that the default setting for new
       windows is changed. Initial setting is 0 milliseconds, meaning `off&apos;.

       defutf8 on|off

       Same as the utf8 command except that the default setting for new  windows
       is changed. Initial setting is `on&apos; if screen was started with &quot;-U&quot;, oth&#8208;
       erwise `off&apos;.

       defwrap on|off

       Same as the wrap command except that the default setting for new  windows
       is  changed. Initially line-wrap is on and can be toggled with the &quot;wrap&quot;
       command (&quot;C-a r&quot;) or by means of &quot;C-a : wrap on|off&quot;.

       defwritelock on|off|auto

       Same as the writelock command except that the  default  setting  for  new
       windows is changed. Initially writelocks will off.

       defzombie [keys]

       Synonym  to  the  zombie command. Both currently change the default.  See
       there.

       detach [-h]

       Detach the screen session (disconnect it from the  terminal  and  put  it
       into  the  background).   This returns you to the shell where you invoked
       screen.  A detached screen can be resumed by invoking screen with the  -r
       option  (see  also  section  &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot;). The -h option tells
       screen to immediately close the connection to the terminal (&quot;hangup&quot;).

       dinfo

       Show what screen thinks about your terminal. Useful if you want  to  know
       why features like color or the alternate charset don&apos;t work.

       displays

       Shows  a tabular listing of all currently connected user front-ends (dis&#8208;
       plays).  This is most useful for multiuser sessions.  The following  keys
       can be used in displays list:

         D Power detach that display
         C-g, enter, or escape Exit the list

       The following is an example of what &quot;displays&quot; could look like:

              xterm 80x42 jnweiger@/dev/ttyp4     0(m11)   &amp;rWx
              facit 80x24 mlschroe@/dev/ttyhf nb 11(tcsh)   rwx
              xterm 80x42 jnhollma@/dev/ttyp5     0(m11)   &amp;R.x
               (A)   (B)     (C)     (D)     (E) (F)(G)   (H)(I)

       The legend is as follows:
       (A) The terminal type known by screen for this display.
       (B) Displays geometry as width x height.
       (C) Username who is logged in at the display.
       (D) Device name of the display or the attached device
       (E) Display is in blocking or nonblocking mode. The available  modes  are
       &quot;nb&quot;, &quot;NB&quot;, &quot;Z&lt;&quot;, &quot;Z&gt;&quot;, and &quot;BL&quot;.
       (F) Number of the window
       (G) Name/title of window
       (H) Whether the window is shared
       (I) Window permissions. Made up of three characters:
             (1st character)
                &#226;-&#226; : no read
                &#226;r&#226; : read
                &#226;R&#226; : read only due to foreign wlock
             (2nd character)
                &#226;-&#226; : no write
                &#226;.&#226; : write suppressed by foreign wlock
                &#226;w&#226; : write
                &#226;W&#226; : own wlock
             (3rd character)
                &#226;-&#226; : no execute
                &#226;x&#226; : execute

       &quot;Displays&quot; needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 5 char&#8208;
       acters high in order to display.

       digraph [preset[unicode-value]]

       This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two  char&#8208;
       acters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the resulting character
       is inserted in the input stream. For example, if the user enters &apos;a&quot;&apos;, an
       a-umlaut  will be inserted. If the first character entered is a 0 (zero),
       screen will treat the following characters (up to three) as an octal num&#8208;
       ber instead.  The optional argument preset is treated as user input, thus
       one can create an &quot;umlaut&quot; key.  For  example  the  command  &quot;bindkey  ^K
       digraph &apos;&quot;&apos;&quot; enables the user to generate an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K a.
       When a non-zero unicode-value is specified, a new digraph is created with
       the  specified  preset.  The digraph is unset if a zero value is provided
       for the unicode-value.

       dumptermcap

       Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal optimized for  the  cur&#8208;
       rently active window to the file &quot;.termcap&quot; in the user&apos;s &quot;$HOME/.screen&quot;
       directory (or wherever screen stores its sockets. See the &quot;FILES&quot; section
       below).   This termcap entry is identical to the value of the environment
       variable $TERMCAP that is set up by screen for each window. For  terminfo
       based  systems  you  will need to run a converter like captoinfo and then
       compile the entry with tic.

       echo [-n] message

       The echo command may be used to annoy screen users with a &apos;message of the
       day&apos;. Typically installed in a global /etc/screenrc.  The option &quot;-n&quot; may
       be used to suppress the line feed.  See also &quot;sleep&quot;.  Echo is also  use&#8208;
       ful for online checking of environment variables.

       encoding enc [enc]

       Tell  screen  how  to interpret the input/output. The first argument sets
       the encoding of the current window. Each window can emulate  a  different
       encoding.  The  optional  second parameter overwrites the encoding of the
       connected terminal. It should never be needed as screen uses  the  locale
       setting to detect the encoding.  There is also a way to select a terminal
       encoding depending on the terminal type by using the &quot;KJ&quot; termcap entry.

       Supported encodings are eucJP, SJIS, eucKR,  eucCN,  Big5,  GBK,  KOI8-R,
       CP1251,  UTF-8,  ISO8859-2,  ISO8859-3,  ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6,
       ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.

       See also &quot;defencoding&quot;, which changes the default setting of a  new  win&#8208;
       dow.

       escape xy

       Set  the  command  character  to x and the character generating a literal
       command character (by triggering the &quot;meta&quot; command) to y (similar to the
       -e  option).  Each argument is either a single character, a two-character
       sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C-x&quot;), a  backslash  followed  by  an
       octal number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash
       followed by a second character, such as &quot;\^&quot; or  &quot;\\&quot;.   The  default  is
       &quot;^Aa&quot;.

       eval command1 [command2 &#226;&#166;]

       Parses and executes each argument as separate command.
&#12;       exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args &#226;&#166;]]

       Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path newcommand and its
       optional arguments) in the current window. The flow of data between  new&#8208;
       commands  stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally started in the win&#8208;
       dow (let us call it &quot;application-process&quot;) and screen itself (window)  is
       controlled  by  the file descriptor pattern fdpat.  This pattern is basi&#8208;
       cally a three character sequence representing stdin, stdout and stderr of
       newcommand.  A dot (.) connects the file descriptor to screen.  An excla&#8208;
       mation mark (!) causes the file descriptor to be connected to the  appli&#8208;
       cation-process. A colon (:) combines both.  User input will go to newcom&#8208;
       mand unless newcommand receives the application-process&apos;  output  (fdpats
       first character is `!&apos; or `:&apos;) or a pipe symbol (|) is added (as a fourth
       character) to the end of fdpat.
       Invoking `exec&apos; without arguments shows name and arguments  of  the  cur&#8208;
       rently  running subprocess in this window. Only one subprocess a time can
       be running in each window.
       When a subprocess is running the `kill&apos; command will affect it instead of
       the windows process.
       Refer  to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps&apos; for a confusing illustration
       of all 21 possible combinations. Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0 rep&#8208;
       resenting the three file descriptors of newcommand. The box marked `W&apos; is
       the usual pty that has the application-process on its  slave  side.   The
       box  marked  `P&apos;  is  the secondary pty that now has screen at its master
       side.

       Abbreviations:
       Whitespace between the word `exec&apos; and fdpat and the command can be omit&#8208;
       ted.  Trailing dots and a fdpat consisting only of dots can be omitted. A
       simple `|&apos; is synonymous for the pattern `!..|&apos;; the  word  exec  can  be
       omitted here and can always be replaced by `!&apos;.

       Examples:

              exec &#226;&#166; /bin/sh
              exec /bin/sh
              !/bin/sh

       Creates  another  shell  in  the same window, while the original shell is
       still running. Output of both shells is displayed and user input is  sent
       to the new /bin/sh.

              exec !.. stty 19200
              exec ! stty 19200
              !!stty 19200

       Set  the speed of the window&apos;s tty. If your stty command operates on std&#8208;
       out, then add another `!&apos;.

              exec !..| less
              |less

       This adds a pager to the window output.  The  special  character  `|&apos;  is
       needed to give the user control over the pager although it gets its input
       from the window&apos;s process. This works, because less listens on stderr  (a
       behavior  that screen would not expect without the `|&apos;) when its stdin is
       not a tty.  Less versions newer than 177 fail miserably here; good old pg
       still works.

              !:sed -n s/.*Error.*/\007/p

       Sends  window  output  to  both,  the  user  and the sed command. The sed
       inserts an additional bell character (oct. 007) to the window output seen
       by  screen.   This  will  cause &quot;Bell in window x&quot; messages, whenever the
       string &quot;Error&quot; appears in the window.

       fit

       Change the window size to the size of the current region. This command is
       needed  because screen doesn&apos;t adapt the window size automatically if the
       window is displayed more than once.

       flow [on|off|auto]

       Sets the flow-control mode for this window.  Without parameters it cycles
       the  current  window&apos;s  flow-control  setting from &quot;automatic&quot; to &quot;on&quot; to
       &quot;off&quot;.  See the discussion on &quot;FLOW-CONTROL&quot; later on  in  this  document
       for  full  details  and  note,  that  this is subject to change in future
       releases.  Default is set by `defflow&apos;.
&#12;       focus [up|down|top|bottom]

       Move the input focus to the next region. This is done in a cyclic way  so
       that the top region is selected after the bottom one. If no subcommand is
       given it defaults to `down&apos;. `up&apos; cycles in the opposite order, `top&apos; and
       `bottom&apos;  go  to  the top and bottom region respectively. Useful bindings
       are (j and k as in vi)
           bind j focus down
           bind k focus up
           bind t focus top
           bind b focus bottom
       Note that k is traditionally bound to the kill command.

       focusminsize [ ( width|max|_ ) ( height|max|_ ) ]

       This forces any currently selected region to be automatically resized  at
       least  a  certain width and height. All other surrounding regions will be
       resized in order to accommodate.  This constraint follows  everytime  the
       &quot;focus&quot;  command  is  used.  The &quot;resize&quot; command can be used to increase
       either dimension of a region, but never below what is set with &quot;focusmin&#8208;
       size&quot;.  The  underscore  `_&apos;  is  a  synonym for max. Setting a width and
       height of `0 0&apos; (zero zero) will undo any constraints and allow for  man&#8208;
       ual  resizing.   Without  any parameters, the minimum width and height is
       shown.

       gr [on|off]

       Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input character
       with  the  8th bit set, it will use the charset stored in the GR slot and
       print the character with the 8th bit  stripped.  The  default  (see  also
       &quot;defgr&quot;)  is  not  to process GR switching because otherwise the ISO88591
       charset would not work.

       group [grouptitle]

       Change or show the group the current window belongs to.  Windows  can  be
       moved  around between different groups by specifying the name of the des&#8208;
       tination group. Without specifying a group,  the  title  of  the  current
       group is displayed.

       hardcopy [-h] [file]

       Writes  out  the  currently  displayed  image to the file file, or, if no
       filename is specified, to hardcopy.n in the default directory, where n is
       the  number of the current window.  This either appends or overwrites the
       file if it exists. See below.  If the option -h is specified,  dump  also
       the contents of the scrollback buffer.

       hardcopy_append on|off

       If  set  to &quot;on&quot;, screen will append to the &quot;hardcopy.n&quot; files created by
       the command &quot;C-a h&quot;, otherwise these files  are  overwritten  each  time.
       Default is `off&apos;.

       hardcopydir directory

       Defines  a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If unset, hard&#8208;
       copys are dumped in screen&apos;s current working directory.

       hardstatus [on|off]
       hardstatus [always]lastline|message|ignore [string]
       hardstatus string [string]

       This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal&apos;s  hardsta&#8208;
       tus  line.  The  first  form toggles whether screen will use the hardware
       status line to display messages. If the flag is set to `off&apos;, these  mes&#8208;
       sages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The default
       setting is `on&apos;.

       The second form tells screen what to do if the terminal  doesn&apos;t  have  a
       hardstatus  line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities &quot;hs&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;fs&quot;
       and &quot;ds&quot; are not set). If  the  type  &quot;lastline&quot;  is  used,  screen  will
       reserve  the  last line of the display for the hardstatus. &quot;message&quot; uses
       screen&apos;s message mechanism and &quot;ignore&quot; tells screen never to display the
       hardstatus.   If  you  prepend  the  word  &quot;always&quot;  to  the  type (e.g.,
       &quot;alwayslastline&quot;), screen will use the type even if the terminal supports
       a hardstatus.

       The  third  form  specifies the contents of the hardstatus line.  &apos;%h&apos; is
       used as default string, i.e., the stored hardstatus of the current window
       (settable  via  &quot;ESC]0;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot;  or  &quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\&quot;) is displayed.
       You can customize this to any string you like including the escapes  from
       the  &quot;STRING  ESCAPES&quot; chapter. If you leave out the argument string, the
       current string is displayed.

       You can mix the second and third form by providing the  string  as  addi&#8208;
       tional argument.

       height [-w|-d] [lines [cols]]

       Set  the  display height to a specified number of lines. When no argument
       is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines display. You can also specify
       a width if you want to change both values.  The -w option tells screen to
       leave the display size unchanged and just set the window  size,  -d  vice
       versa.

       help [-c class]

       Not  really a online help, but displays a help screen showing you all the
       key bindings.  The first pages list all the internal commands followed by
       their  current  bindings.   Subsequent pages will display the custom com&#8208;
       mands, one command per key.  Press space when you&apos;re  done  reading  each
       page,  or return to exit early.  All other characters are ignored. If the
       &quot;-c&quot; option is given, display all bound commands for the  specified  com&#8208;
       mand class.  See also &quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot; section.

       history

       Usually  users work with a shell that allows easy access to previous com&#8208;
       mands.  For example csh has the command &quot;!!&quot; to repeat the  last  command
       executed.   Screen  allows you to have a primitive way of re-calling &quot;the
       command that started &#226;&#166;&quot;: You just type the first letter of that command,
       then  hit  `C-a  {&apos; and screen tries to find a previous line that matches
       with the `prompt character&apos; to the left  of  the  cursor.  This  line  is
       pasted  into  this  window&apos;s  input queue.  Thus you have a crude command
       history (made up by the visible window and its scrollback buffer).

       hstatus status

       Change the window&apos;s hardstatus line to the string status.

       idle [timeout [cmd args]]

       Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds inactiv&#8208;
       ity  is  reached.  This command will normally be the &quot;blanker&quot; command to
       create a screen blanker, but it can be any screen command.  If no command
       is  specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero (or the special
       timeout off) disables the timer.  If no arguments are given, the  current
       settings are displayed.

       ignorecase [on|off]

       Tell  screen  to  ignore  the  case of characters in searches. Default is
       `off&apos;. Without any options, the state of ignorecase is toggled.

       info

       Uses the message line to display some information about the current  win&#8208;
       dow:  the  cursor  position  in  the  form  &quot;(column,row)&quot;  starting with
       &quot;(1,1)&quot;, the terminal width and height plus the size  of  the  scrollback
       buffer  in  lines,  like  in  &quot;(80,24)+50&quot;,  the  current state of window
       XON/XOFF flow control is shown like this (See also section FLOW CONTROL):

         +flow     automatic flow control, currently on.
         -flow     automatic flow control, currently off.
         +(+)flow  flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic control.
         -(+)flow  flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
         +(-)flow  flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
         -(-)flow  flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic control.

       The current line wrap setting (`+wrap&apos; indicates enabled, `-wrap&apos; not) is
       also  shown.  The  flags `ins&apos;, `org&apos;, `app&apos;, `log&apos;, `mon&apos; or `nored&apos; are
       displayed when the window is in insert mode,  origin  mode,  application-
       keypad  mode,  has  output logging, activity monitoring or partial redraw
       enabled.

       The currently active character set (G0, G1, G2,  or  G3)  and  in  square
       brackets  the terminal character sets that are currently designated as G0
       through G3 is shown. If the window is in UTF-8 mode, the  string  &quot;UTF-8&quot;
       is shown instead.

       Additional modes depending on the type of the window are displayed at the
       end of the status line (See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;).
       If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default  state,
       the info line is started with a string identifying the current state.
       For system information use the &quot;time&quot; command.

       ins_reg [key]

       No longer exists, use &quot;paste&quot; instead.

       kill

       Kill current window.
       If  there  is  an `exec&apos; command running then it is killed. Otherwise the
       process (shell) running in the window receives a  HANGUP  condition,  the
       window structure is removed and screen (your display) switches to another
       window.  When the last window is destroyed, screen exits.  After  a  kill
       screen switches to the previously displayed window.
       Note:  Emacs users should keep this command in mind, when killing a line.
       It is recommended not to use &quot;C-a&quot; as the screen escape key or to  rebind
       kill to &quot;C-a K&quot;.

       lastmsg

       Redisplay the last contents of the message/status line.  Useful if you&apos;re
       typing when a message appears, because  the message goes  away  when  you
       press  a key (unless your terminal has a hardware status line).  Refer to
       the commands &quot;msgwait&quot; and &quot;msgminwait&quot; for fine tuning.

       layout new [title]

       Create a new layout. The screen will change to one whole  region  and  be
       switched  to  the  blank window. From here, you build the regions and the
       windows they show as you desire. The new layout will be numbered with the
       smallest available integer, starting with zero. You can optionally give a
       title to your new layout.  Otherwise, it will have  a  default  title  of
       &quot;layout&quot;. You can always change the title later by using the command lay&#8208;
       out title.

       layout remove [n|title]

       Remove, or in other words, delete the specified layout. Either the number
       or  the title can be specified. Without either specification, screen will
       remove the current layout.

       Removing a layout does not affect your set windows or regions.

       layout next

       Switch to the next layout available

       layout prev

       Switch to the previous layout available

       layout select [n|title]

       Select the desired layout. Either the number or the title can  be  speci&#8208;
       fied.  Without  either  specification,  screen  will prompt and ask which
       screen is desired. To see which layouts are  available,  use  the  layout
       show command.

       layout show

       List on the message line the number(s) and title(s) of the available lay&#8208;
       out(s). The current layout is flagged.

       layout title [title]

       Change or display the title of the current layout. A string given will be
       used  to name the layout. Without any options, the current title and num&#8208;
       ber is displayed on the message line.

       layout number [n]

       Change or display the number of the current layout. An integer given will
       be used to number the layout. Without any options, the current number and
       title is displayed on the message line.
&#12;       layout attach [title|:last]

       Change or display which layout to reattach back to. The default is :last,
       which  tells  screen to reattach back to the last used layout just before
       detachment. By supplying a title, You can instruct screen to reattach  to
       a  particular layout regardless which one was used at the time of detach&#8208;
       ment. Without any options, the layout to reattach to will be shown in the
       message line.

       layout save [n|title]

       Remember  the  current  arrangement  of  regions.  When used, screen will
       remember the arrangement of vertically and  horizontally  split  regions.
       This  arrangement  is  restored  when  a  screen session is reattached or
       switched back from a different layout. If the session ends or the  screen
       process  dies,  the layout arrangements are lost. The layout dump command
       should help in this siutation. If a number or title is  supplied,  screen
       will  remember  the  arrangement  of  that particular layout. Without any
       options, screen will remember the current layout.

       Saving your regions  can  be  done  automatically  by  using  the  layout
       autosave command.

       layout autosave [on|off]

       Change  or display the status of automatcally saving layouts. The default
       is on, meaning when screen is detached or changed to a different  layout,
       the  arrangement of regions and windows will be remembered at the time of
       change and restored upon  return.   If  autosave  is  set  to  off,  that
       arrangement  will  only  be  restored  to either to the last manual save,
       using layout save, or to when the layout was first created, to  a  single
       region  with  a  single  window. Without either an on or off, the current
       status is displayed on the message line.

       layout dump [filename]

       Write to a file the order of splits made in the current layout.  This  is
       useful to recreate the order of your regions used in your current layout.
       Only the current layout is recorded. While the order of the  regions  are
       recorded,  the  sizes  of  those  regions and which windows correspond to
       which regions are not. If no filename is specified, the default  is  lay&#8208;
       out-dump,  saved in the directory that the screen process was started in.
       If the file already exists, layout dump will append to that file.  As  an
       example:

                   C-a : layout dump /home/user/.screenrc

       will save or append the layout to the user&apos;s .screenrc file.

       license

       Display  the  disclaimer  page.  This  is done whenever screen is started
       without options, which should be often enough. See also the &quot;startup_mes&#8208;
       sage&quot; command.

       lockscreen

       Lock   this  display.   Call  a  screenlock  program  (/local/bin/lck  or
       /usr/bin/lock or a builtin if no other is  available).  Screen  does  not
       accept  any  command  keys  until this program terminates. Meanwhile pro&#8208;
       cesses in the windows may continue, as the windows are in the  `detached&apos;
       state.  The  screenlock  program  may  be changed through the environment
       variable $LOCKPRG (which must be set in the shell from  which  screen  is
       started) and is executed with the user&apos;s uid and gid.
       Warning:  When  you  leave other shells unlocked and you have no password
       set on screen, the lock is void:  One  could  easily  re-attach  from  an
       unlocked shell. This feature should rather be called `lockterminal&apos;.

       log [on|off]

       Start/stop  writing  output of the current window to a file &quot;screenlog.n&quot;
       in the window&apos;s default directory, where n is the number of  the  current
       window.  This  filename  can be changed with the `logfile&apos; command. If no
       parameter is given, the state of logging is toggled. The session  log  is
       appended  to  the previous contents of the file if it already exists. The
       current contents and the contents  of  the  scrollback  history  are  not
       included in the session log.  Default is `off&apos;.

       logfile filename
       logfile flush secs

       Defines  the  name the log files will get. The default is &quot;screenlog.%n&quot;.
       The second form changes the number of seconds  screen  will  wait  before
       flushing  the  logfile buffer to the file-system. The default value is 10
       seconds.

       login [on|off]

       Adds or removes the entry in the utmp database file for the current  win&#8208;
       dow.   This  controls if the window is `logged in&apos;.  When no parameter is
       given, the login state of the window is toggled.   Additionally  to  that
       toggle,  it  is  convenient  having  a `log in&apos; and a `log out&apos; key. E.g.
       `bind I login on&apos; and `bind O login off&apos; will map these keys to be C-a  I
       and  C-a  O.   The  default setting (in config.h.in) should be &quot;on&quot; for a
       screen that runs under suid-root.  Use the &quot;deflogin&quot; command  to  change
       the  default  login state for new windows. Both commands are only present
       when screen has been compiled with utmp support.

       logtstamp [on|off]
       logtstamp after [secs]
       logtstamp string [string]

       This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of screen.   If  time-
       stamps  are turned &quot;on&quot;, screen adds a string containing the current time
       to the logfile after two minutes of inactivity.   When  output  continues
       and  more  than  another  two minutes have passed, a second time-stamp is
       added to document the restart of the output. You can change this  timeout
       with the second form of the command. The third form is used for customiz&#8208;
       ing the time-stamp string (`-- %n:%t  --  time-stamp  --  %M/%d/%y  %c:%s
       --\n&apos; by default).

       mapdefault

       Tell screen that the next input character should only be looked up in the
       default bindkey table. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.

       mapnotnext

       Like mapdefault, but don&apos;t even look in the default bindkey table.

       maptimeout [timeout]

       Set the inter-character timer for input sequence detection to  a  timeout
       of timeout ms. The default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments
       shows the current setting.  See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.

       markkeys string

       This is a method of changing the keymap used for copy/history mode.   The
       string  is  made  up of oldchar=newchar pairs which are separated by `:&apos;.
       Example: The string &quot;B=^B:F=^F&quot; will change the keys `C-b&apos; and  `C-f&apos;  to
       the  vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page).  This happens to be the
       default binding for `B&apos; and `F&apos;.  The command  &quot;markkeys  h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot;
       would  set  the  mode for an emacs-style binding.  If your terminal sends
       characters, that cause you to abort copy mode, then this command may help
       by  binding  these  characters to do nothing.  The no-op character is `@&apos;
       and is used like this: &quot;markkeys @=L=H&quot; if you do not want to use the `H&apos;
       or  `L&apos; commands any longer.  As shown in this example, multiple keys can
       be assigned to one function in a single statement.

       maxwin num

       Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesn&apos;t affect  already
       existing  windows.  The  number  can  be increased only when there are no
       existing windows.

       meta

       Insert the command character (C-a) in the current window&apos;s input stream.

       monitor [on|off]

       Toggles activity monitoring of windows.  When monitoring is turned on and
       an  affected window is switched into the background, you will receive the
       activity notification message in the status line at  the  first  sign  of
       output  and the window will also be marked with an `@&apos; in the window-sta&#8208;
       tus display.  Monitoring is initially off for all windows.

       mousetrack [on|off]

       This command determines whether screen will watch for mouse clicks.  When
       this command is enabled, regions that have been split in various ways can
       be selected by pointing to them with  a  mouse  and  left-clicking  them.
       Without specifying on or off, the current state is displayed. The default
       state is determined by the &quot;defmousetrack&quot; command.

       msgminwait sec

       Defines the time screen delays a new message when  one  message  is  cur&#8208;
       rently displayed.  The default is 1 second.

       msgwait sec

       Defines  the  time  a  message is displayed if screen is not disturbed by
       other activity. The default is 5 seconds.

       multiuser on|off

       Switch between singleuser and multiuser mode. Standard  screen  operation
       is  singleuser.  In  multiuser  mode  the  commands  `acladd&apos;,  `aclchg&apos;,
       `aclgrp&apos; and `acldel&apos; can be used to enable  (and  disable)  other  users
       accessing this screen session.

       nethack on|off

       Changes the kind of error messages used by screen.  When you are familiar
       with the game &quot;nethack&quot;, you may enjoy the nethack-style  messages  which
       will often blur the facts a little, but are much funnier to read. Anyway,
       standard messages often tend to be unclear as well.
       This option is only available if screen was  compiled  with  the  NETHACK
       flag  defined.  The default setting is then determined by the presence of
       the environment variable $NETHACKOPTIONS and the file ~/.nethackrc  -  if
       either one is present, the default is on.

       next

       Switch  to the next window.  This command can be used repeatedly to cycle
       through the list of windows.

       nonblock [on|off|numsecs]

       Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces  (displays)  that  cease  to
       accept  output.  This can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem con&#8208;
       nection gets cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is off  (this  is
       the  default)  screen waits until the display restarts to accept the out&#8208;
       put. If nonblock is on, screen waits until the timeout is reached (on  is
       treated  as  1s). If the display still doesn&apos;t receive characters, screen
       will consider it &quot;blocked&quot; and stop sending characters to it. If at  some
       time  it  restarts  to accept characters, screen will unblock the display
       and redisplay the updated window contents.

       number [[+|-]n]

       Change the current window&apos;s number. If the given number n is already used
       by another window, both windows exchange their numbers. If no argument is
       specified, the current window number (and title) is shown. Using  `+&apos;  or
       `-&apos; will change the window&apos;s number by the relative amount specified.

       obuflimit [limit]

       If  the  output  buffer  contains more bytes than the specified limit, no
       more data will be read from the windows. The default value is 256. If you
       have a fast display (like xterm), you can set it to some higher value. If
       no argument is specified, the current setting is displayed.

       only

       Kill all regions but the current one.

       other

       Switch to the window displayed previously. If this window does no  longer
       exist, other has the same effect as next.

       partial on|off

       Defines whether the display should be refreshed (as with redisplay) after
       switching to the current window. This command only  affects  the  current
       window.   To  immediately  affect all windows use the allpartial command.
       Default is `off&apos;, of course.  This default is fixed,  as  there  is  cur&#8208;
       rently no defpartial command.

       password [crypted_pw]

       Present  a  crypted password in your &quot;.screenrc&quot; file and screen will ask
       for it, whenever someone attempts to resume a detached. This is useful if
       you have privileged programs running under screen and you want to protect
       your session from reattach attempts by another user masquerading as  your
       uid  (i.e.  any  superuser.)  If no crypted password is specified, screen
       prompts twice for typing a password and  places  its  encryption  in  the
       paste buffer.  Default is `none&apos;, this disables password checking.

       paste [registers [dest_reg]]

       Write the (concatenated) contents of the specified registers to the stdin
       queue of the current window. The register &apos;.&apos; is  treated  as  the  paste
       buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a single regis&#8208;
       ter to paste.  The paste buffer can be filled with the copy, history  and
       readbuf commands.  Other registers can be filled with the register, read&#8208;
       reg and paste commands.  If paste is called with a second  argument,  the
       contents  of the specified registers is pasted into the named destination
       register rather than the window. If &apos;.&apos; is used as the  second  argument,
       the  displays paste buffer is the destination.  Note, that &quot;paste&quot; uses a
       wide variety of resources: Whenever a second  argument  is  specified  no
       current  window  is  needed.  When the source specification only contains
       registers (not the paste buffer) then there need not be a current display
       (terminal  attached),  as  the registers are a global resource. The paste
       buffer exists once for every user.

       pastefont [on|off]

       Tell screen to include font information in the paste buffer. The  default
       is  not  to  do so. This command is especially useful for multi character
       fonts like kanji.

       pow_break

       Reopen the window&apos;s  terminal  line  and  send  a  break  condition.  See
       `break&apos;.

       pow_detach

       Power  detach.  Mainly the same as detach, but also sends a HANGUP signal
       to the parent process of screen.  CAUTION: This will result in a  logout,
       when screen was started from your login shell.

       pow_detach_msg [message]

       The  message  specified here is output whenever a `Power detach&apos; was per&#8208;
       formed. It may be used as a replacement for a logout message or to  reset
       baud rate, etc.  Without parameter, the current message is shown.

       prev

       Switch  to  the  window  with the next lower number.  This command can be
       used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.

       printcmd [cmd]

       If cmd is not an empty string, screen will not use the terminal capabili&#8208;
       ties &quot;po/pf&quot; if it detects an ansi print sequence ESC [ 5 i, but pipe the
       output into cmd.  This should normally be a command like &quot;lpr&quot; or &quot;&apos;cat &gt;
       /tmp/scrprint&apos;&quot;.   printcmd  without  a command displays the current set&#8208;
       ting.  The ansi sequence ESC \ ends printing and closes the pipe.
       Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have write access to
       your terminal, they will be able to fire off print commands.

       process [key]

       Stuff  the  contents of the specified register into screen&apos;s input queue.
       If no argument is given you are prompted for a register name. The text is
       parsed  as if it had been typed in from the user&apos;s keyboard. This command
       can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.

       quit

       Kill all windows and terminate screen.  Note that on  VT100-style  termi&#8208;
       nals the keys C-4 and C-\ are identical.  This makes the default bindings
       dangerous: Be careful not to type C-a C-4 when selecting  window  no.  4.
       Use the empty bind command (as in &quot;bind &apos;^\&apos;&quot;) to remove a key binding.

       readbuf [-e encoding] [filename]

       Reads  the contents of the specified file into the paste buffer.  You can
       tell screen the encoding of the file via the -e option.  If  no  file  is
       specified,  the  screen-exchange filename is used.  See also &quot;bufferfile&quot;
       command.
&#12;       readreg [-e encoding] [register [filename]]

       Does one of two things, dependent on number of arguments:  with  zero  or
       one  arguments it it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the regis&#8208;
       ter specified or entered at the prompt. With two arguments it  reads  the
       contents  of  the named file into the register, just as readbuf reads the
       screen-exchange file into the paste buffer.   You  can  tell  screen  the
       encoding of the file via the -e option.  The following example will paste
       the system&apos;s password file into the  screen  window  (using  register  p,
       where a copy remains):

                   C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd
                   C-a : paste p

       redisplay

       Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full redisplay when in par&#8208;
       tial redraw mode.

       register [-e encoding] key string

       Save the specified string to the  register  key.   The  encoding  of  the
       string can be specified via the -e option.  See also the &quot;paste&quot; command.

       remove

       Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is only one region.

       removebuf

       Unlinks  the  screen-exchange  file  used  by the commands &quot;writebuf&quot; and
       &quot;readbuf&quot;.

       rendition bell | monitor | silence | so attr [color]

       Change the way screen renders the titles of windows that have monitor  or
       bell  flags  set  in caption or hardstatus or windowlist. See the &quot;STRING
       ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the syntax of the modifiers.  The default for  moni&#8208;
       tor is currently &quot;=b &quot; (bold, active colors), for bell &quot;=ub &quot; (underline,
       bold and active colors), and &quot;=u &quot; for silence.

       reset

       Reset the virtual terminal to its &quot;power-on&quot; values. Useful when  strange
       settings  (like  scroll  regions or graphics character set) are left over
       from an application.

       resize

       Resize the current region. The space will be removed from or added to the
       region below or if there&apos;s not enough space from the region above.

              resize +N   increase current region height by N

              resize -N   decrease current region height by N

              resize  N   set current region height to N

              resize  =   make all windows equally high

              resize  max maximize current region height

              resize  min minimize current region height

       screen [-opts] [n] [cmd [args]|//group]

       Establish  a  new  window.   The  flow-control options (-f, -fn and -fa),
       title (a.k.a.) option (-t), login options (-l and -ln)  ,  terminal  type
       option  (-T  &lt;term&gt;),  the all-capability-flag (-a) and scrollback option
       (-h &lt;num&gt;) may be specified with each command.   The  option  (-M)  turns
       monitoring  on  for this window.  The option (-L) turns output logging on
       for this window.  If an optional number n in  the  range  0..MAXWIN-1  is
       given,  the  window number n is assigned to the newly created window (or,
       if this number is already in-use, the next available number).  If a  com&#8208;
       mand is specified after &quot;screen&quot;, this command (with the given arguments)
       is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created.  If  //group  is
       supplied,  a  container-type window is created in which other windows may
       be created inside it.

       Thus, if your &quot;.screenrc&quot; contains the lines

                   # example for .screenrc:
                   screen 1
                   screen -fn -t foobar -L 2 telnet foobar

       screen creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window with  a  TELNET
       connection  to  the  machine foobar (with no flow-control using the title
       &quot;foobar&quot; in window #2) and will write a logfile  (&quot;screenlog.2&quot;)  of  the
       telnet  session.   Note, that unlike previous versions of screen no addi&#8208;
       tional default window is created when &quot;screen&quot; commands are  included  in
       your  &quot;.screenrc&quot;  file.  When  the  initialization  is completed, screen
       switches to the last window specified in your .screenrc file or, if none,
       opens a default window #0.
       Screen  has  built  in some functionality of &quot;cu&quot; and &quot;telnet&quot;.  See also
       chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;.

       scrollback num

       Set the size of the scrollback buffer for  the  current  windows  to  num
       lines. The default scrollback is 100 lines.  See also the &quot;defscrollback&quot;
       command and use &quot;info&quot; to view the current setting. To access and use the
       contents in the scrollback buffer, use the &quot;copy&quot; command.

       select [WindowID]

       Switch  to  the window identified by WindowID.  This can be a prefix of a
       window title (alphanumeric window name) or a window number.  The  parame&#8208;
       ter is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an identifier.  When
       a new window is established, the first available number  is  assigned  to
       this window.  Thus, the first window can be activated by &quot;select 0&quot;.  The
       number of windows is limited at compile-time by the MAXWIN  configuration
       parameter  (which  defaults to 40).  There are two special WindowIDs, &quot;-&quot;
       selects the internal blank window and &quot;.&quot; selects the current window. The
       latter is useful if used with screen&apos;s &quot;-X&quot; option.

       sessionname [name]

       Rename  the current session. Note, that for &quot;screen -list&quot; the name shows
       up with the process-id prepended. If the argument &quot;name&quot; is omitted,  the
       name  of  this  session is displayed. Caution: The $STY environment vari&#8208;
       ables will still reflect the old name in pre-existing  shells.  This  may
       result  in  confusion.  Use of this command is generally discouraged. Use
       the &quot;-S&quot; command-line option if you want to  name  a  new  session.   The
       default is constructed from the tty and host names.

       setenv [var [string]]

       Set  the environment variable var to value string.  If only var is speci&#8208;
       fied, the user will be prompted to enter a value.  If no  parameters  are
       specified,  the  user  will  be prompted for both variable and value. The
       environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells.

       setsid [on|off]

       Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for  the  win&#8208;
       dows.  If  setsid is turned off, this is not done anymore and all windows
       will be in the same process group as the  screen  backend  process.  This
       also  breaks  job-control,  so be careful.  The default is on, of course.
       This command is probably useful only in rare circumstances.

       shell command

       Set the command to be used to create a new  shell.   This  overrides  the
       value  of  the environment variable $SHELL.  This is useful if you&apos;d like
       to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the program specified
       in  $SHELL. If the command begins with a &apos;-&apos; character, the shell will be
       started as a login-shell.

       shelltitle title

       Set the title for all shells created during startup or  by  the  C-A  C-c
       command.   For details about what a title is, see the discussion entitled
       &quot;TITLES (naming windows)&quot;.

       silence [on|off|sec]

       Toggles silence monitoring of windows.  When silence is turned on and  an
       affected  window  is  switched  into the background, you will receive the
       silence notification message in the status line after a specified  period
       of  inactivity  (silence).  The  default  timeout can be changed with the
       `silencewait&apos; command or by specifying a number  of  seconds  instead  of
       `on&apos; or `off&apos;.  Silence is initially off for all windows.

       silencewait sec

       Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait before
       displaying a message. Default 30 seconds.

       sleep num

       This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file  for  num  sec&#8208;
       onds.   Keyboard  activity  will  end  the sleep.  It may be used to give
       users a chance to read the messages output by &quot;echo&quot;.

       slowpaste msec

       Define the speed at which text is inserted into the current window by the
       paste (&quot;C-a ]&quot;) command.  If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is writ&#8208;
       ten character by character.  screen will make a pause of  msec  millisec&#8208;
       onds  after  each  single  character  write  to  allow the application to
       process its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying  system  exposes
       flow control problems while pasting large amounts of text.

       source file

       Read  and  execute commands from file file. Source commands may be nested
       to a maximum recursion level of ten. If file is not an absolute path  and
       screen  is  already  processing a source command, the parent directory of
       the running source command file is used to search  for  the  new  command
       file before screen&apos;s current directory.

       Note  that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at startup and
       reattach time, so they must be reached via the default screenrc files  to
       have an effect.

       sorendition [attr [color]]

       This command is deprecated. See &quot;rendition so&quot; instead.

       split [-v]

       Split  the  current  region into two new ones. All regions on the display
       are resized to make room for the new region. The  blank  window  is  dis&#8208;
       played on the new region. Splits are made horizontally unless -v is used.
       Use the &quot;remove&quot; or the &quot;only&quot; command to delete regions. Use &quot;focus&quot;  to
       toggle between regions.

       startup_message on|off

       Select  whether  you  want  to  see  the copyright notice during startup.
       Default is `on&apos;, as you probably noticed.

       stuff [string]

       Stuff the string string in the input buffer of the current window.   This
       is  like  the  &quot;paste&quot;  command  but  with much less overhead.  Without a
       parameter, screen will prompt for a string to stuff.   You  cannot  paste
       large  buffers  with the &quot;stuff&quot; command. It is most useful for key bind&#8208;
       ings. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.

       su [username [password [password2]]]

       Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts for all  parameters
       that  are omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters, they have to
       be specified un-crypted. The first password is matched against  the  sys&#8208;
       tems  passwd  database, the second password is matched against the screen
       password as set with the commands &quot;acladd&quot; or &quot;password&quot;.   &quot;Su&quot;  may  be
       useful  for  the screen administrator to test multiuser setups.  When the
       identification fails, the user has access to the commands  available  for
       user  nobody.  These are &quot;detach&quot;, &quot;license&quot;, &quot;version&quot;, &quot;help&quot; and &quot;dis&#8208;
       plays&quot;.

       suspend

       Suspend screen.  The windows are in the `detached&apos; state, while screen is
       suspended. This feature relies on the shell being able to do job control.

       term term

       In  each  window&apos;s environment screen opens, the $TERM variable is set to
       &quot;screen&quot; by default.  But when no description for &quot;screen&quot;  is  installed
       in  the  local  termcap  or  terminfo data base, you set $TERM to - say -
       &quot;vt100&quot;. This won&apos;t do much harm, as  screen  is  VT100/ANSI  compatible.
       The  use  of  the  &quot;term&quot; command is discouraged for non-default purpose.
       That is, one may want to specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100)  for
       the next &quot;screen rlogin othermachine&quot; command. Use the command &quot;screen -T
       vt100 rlogin othermachine&quot; rather than setting and resetting the default.

       termcap term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]
       terminfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]
       termcapinfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]
&#12;       Use this command to modify your terminal&apos;s termcap  entry  without  going
       through  all  the  hassles  involved  in creating a custom termcap entry.
       Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the windows.
       You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as
       they are meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted.
       If your system works uses the  terminfo  database  rather  than  termcap,
       screen will understand the `terminfo&apos; command, which has the same effects
       as the `termcap&apos; command.  Two separate commands are provided,  as  there
       are  subtle  syntactic  differences,  e.g.  when  parameter interpolation
       (using `%&apos;) is required. Note that termcap names of the capabilities have
       to be used with the `terminfo&apos; command.
       In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and termcap
       syntax, you can use the command `termcapinfo&apos;, which is just a  shorthand
       for a pair of `termcap&apos; and `terminfo&apos; commands with identical arguments.

       The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be affected by this
       definition.  You can specify multiple terminal names by  separating  them
       with  `|&apos;s.  Use `*&apos; to match all terminals and `vt*&apos; to match all termi&#8208;
       nals that begin with &quot;vt&quot;.

       Each tweak argument contains one or more termcap  defines  (separated  by
       `:&apos;s)  to  be  inserted  at  the  start of the appropriate termcap entry,
       enhancing it or overriding existing values.   The  first  tweak  modifies
       your terminal&apos;s termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses
       to perform certain functions.   Specify  a  null  string  to  leave  this
       unchanged (e.g. &apos;&apos;).  The second (optional) tweak modifies all the window
       termcaps, and should contain definitions that screen understands (see the
       &quot;VIRTUAL TERMINAL&quot; section).

       Some examples:

              termcap xterm*  LP:hs@

       Informs screen that all terminals that begin with `xterm&apos; have firm auto-
       margins that allow the last position on the screen to  be  updated  (LP),
       but  they  don&apos;t  really have a status line (no &apos;hs&apos; - append `@&apos; to turn
       entries off).  Note that we assume `LP&apos; for all terminal names that start
       with  &quot;vt&quot;, but only if you don&apos;t specify a termcap command for that ter&#8208;
       minal.

              termcap vt*  LP
              termcap vt102|vt220  Z0=\E[?3h:Z1=\E[?3l

       Specifies the firm-margined `LP&apos; capability for all terminals that  begin
       with  `vt&apos;,  and  the  second  line will also add the escape-sequences to
       switch into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this
       is  a VT102 or VT220.  (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap to use
       the width-changing commands.)

              termcap vt100  &quot;&quot;  l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4

       This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key labels  to
       each window&apos;s termcap entry.

              termcap h19|z19  am@:im=\E@:ei=\EO  dc=\E[P

       Takes  a  h19 or z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables
       the insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities  (the  `@&apos;  in  the
       `im&apos;  string  is after the `=&apos;, so it is part of the string).  Having the
       `im&apos; and `ei&apos; definitions put into your  terminal&apos;s  termcap  will  cause
       screen to automatically advertise the character-insert capability in each
       window&apos;s termcap.  Each window will also get the  delete-character  capa&#8208;
       bility  (dc)  added  to  its  termcap, which screen will translate into a
       line-update for the terminal (we&apos;re pretending it doesn&apos;t support charac&#8208;
       ter deletion).

       If  you  would  like  to  fully  specify each window&apos;s termcap entry, you
       should instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running screen.   See
       the  discussion  on  the &quot;VIRTUAL TERMINAL&quot; in this manual, and the term&#8208;
       cap(5) man page for more information on termcap definitions.

       time [string]

       Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name, and  the
       load  averages  over  1,  5, and 15 minutes (if this is available on your
       system).  For window specific information, use &quot;info&quot;.

       If a string is specified, it changes the format of the time  report  like
       it is described in the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a default of
       &quot;%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?&quot;.

       title [windowtitle]

       Set the name of the current window to windowtitle. If no name  is  speci&#8208;
       fied, screen prompts for one. This command was known as `aka&apos; in previous
       releases.

       unbindall

       Unbind all the bindings. This can be useful when screen  is  used  solely
       for  its  detaching abilities, such as when letting a console application
       run as a daemon. If, for some reason, it is necessary  to  bind  commands
       after this, use &apos;screen -X&apos;.

       unsetenv var

       Unset an environment variable.

       utf8 [on|off [on|off]]

       Change  the  encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is enabled, the
       strings sent to the window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice versa. Omitting
       the  parameter  toggles  the setting. If a second parameter is given, the
       display&apos;s encoding is also changed  (this  should  rather  be  done  with
       screen&apos;s  &quot;-U&quot;  option).   See  also &quot;defutf8&quot;, which changes the default
       setting of a new window.

       vbell [on|off]

       Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting the parameter tog&#8208;
       gles  the  setting.  If  vbell is switched on, but your terminal does not
       support a visual bell, a `vbell-message&apos; is displayed in the status  line
       when  the bell character (^G) is received.  Visual bell support of a ter&#8208;
       minal is defined by the termcap variable `vb&apos; (terminfo: &apos;flash&apos;).
       Per default, vbell is off, thus the  audible  bell  is  used.   See  also
       `bell_msg&apos;.

       vbell_msg [message]

       Sets  the  visual  bell message. message is printed to the status line if
       the window receives a bell character (^G), vbell is set to &quot;on&quot;, but  the
       terminal  does  not support a visual bell.  The default message is &quot;Wuff,
       Wuff!!&quot;.  Without a parameter, the current message is shown.

       vbellwait sec

       Define a delay in seconds after each display of screen&apos;s visual bell mes&#8208;
       sage. The default is 1 second.

       verbose [on|off]

       If  verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a window
       is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is off.  Without a
       parameter, the current setting is shown.

       version

       Print the current version and the compile date in the status line.

       wall message

       Write  a  message  to all displays. The message will appear in the termi&#8208;
       nal&apos;s status line.

       width [-w|-d] [cols [lines]]

       Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to cols col&#8208;
       umns  if  an argument is specified.  This requires a capable terminal and
       the termcap entries &quot;Z0&quot; and &quot;Z1&quot;.  See the &quot;termcap&quot;  command  for  more
       information. You can also specify a new height if you want to change both
       values.  The -w option tells screen to leave the display  size  unchanged
       and just set the window size, -d vice versa.

       windowlist [-b] [-m] [-g]
       windowlist string [string]
       windowlist title [title]

       Display  all  windows  in a table for visual window selection.  If screen
       was in a window group, screen will back out of the group and then display
       the windows in that group.  If the -b option is given, screen will switch
       to the blank window before presenting the list, so that the current  win&#8208;
       dow  is also selectable.  The -m option changes the order of the windows,
       instead of sorting by window  numbers  screen  uses  its  internal  most-
       recently-used  list.   The  -g  option  will  show the windows inside any
       groups in that level and downwards.

       The following keys are used to navigate in &quot;windowlist&quot;:
         k, C-p, or up Move up one line.
         j, C-n, or down Move down one line.
         C-g or escape Exit windowlist.
         C-a or home Move to the first line.
         C-e or end Move to the last line.
         C-u or C-d Move one half page up or down.
         C-b or C-f Move one full page up or down.
         0..9 Using the number keys, move to the selected line.
         mouseclick Move to the selected line. Available  when  &quot;mousetrack&quot;  is
           set to &quot;on&quot;
         / Search.
         n Repeat search in the forward direction.
         N Repeat search in the backward direction.
         m Toggle MRU.
         g Toggle group nesting.
         a All window view.
         C-h or backspace Back out the group.
         , Switch numbers with the previous window.
         . Switch numbers with the next window.
         K Kill that window.
         space or enter Select that window.

       The  table  format  can  be changed with the string and title option, the
       title is displayed as table heading, while the lines are  made  by  using
       the  string  setting.  The  default  setting is &quot;Num Name%=Flags&quot; for the
       title and &quot;%3n %t%=%f&quot; for the lines.  See the &quot;STRING  ESCAPES&quot;  chapter
       for more codes (e.g. color settings).

       &quot;Windowlist&quot;  needs  a  region  size of at least 10 characters wide and 6
       characters high in order to display.

       windows

       Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows.  Each  window
       is listed by number with the name of process that has been started in the
       window (or its title); the current window is marked with a `*&apos;; the  pre&#8208;
       vious  window  is marked with a `-&apos;; all the windows that are &quot;logged in&quot;
       are marked with a `$&apos;; a background window that has received  a  bell  is
       marked  with  a  `!&apos;; a background window that is being monitored and has
       had activity occur is marked with an `@&apos;; a window which has output  log&#8208;
       ging  turned on is marked with `(L)&apos;; windows occupied by other users are
       marked with `&amp;&apos;; windows in the zombie state are  marked  with  `Z&apos;.   If
       this  list is too long to fit on the terminal&apos;s status line only the por&#8208;
       tion around the current window is displayed.

       wrap [on|off]

       Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window.  When line-wrap is on,
       the second consecutive printable character output at the last column of a
       line will wrap to the start of the following line.  As an added  feature,
       backspace  (^H)  will  also  wrap through the left margin to the previous
       line.  Default is `on&apos;. Without any options, the state of  wrap  is  tog&#8208;
       gled.

       writebuf [-e encoding] [filename]

       Writes  the  contents  of  the paste buffer to the specified file, or the
       public accessible screen-exchange file if no filename is given.  This  is
       thought  of as a primitive means of communication between screen users on
       the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded on
       the  fly to match the encoding.  The filename can be set with the buffer&#8208;
       file command and defaults to &quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;.

       writelock [on|off|auto]

       In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able  to  write
       to  the same window at once. Per default, writelock is in `auto&apos; mode and
       grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to  switch
       to  the  particular  window.  When  he leaves the window, other users may
       obtain the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current window
       is  disabled  by the command &quot;writelock off&quot;. If the user issues the com&#8208;
       mand &quot;writelock on&quot; he keeps the exclusive write permission while switch&#8208;
       ing to other windows.

       xoff
       xon

       Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of the current win&#8208;
       dow.

       zmodem [off|auto|catch|pass]
       zmodem sendcmd [string]
       zmodem recvcmd [string]

       Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two different  modes
       when it detects a zmodem request: &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;catch&quot;.  If the mode is set
       to &quot;pass&quot;, screen will relay all data to the attacher until  the  end  of
       the  transmission  is  reached.   In &quot;catch&quot; mode screen acts as a zmodem
       endpoint and starts the corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is  set
       to  &quot;auto&quot;, screen will use &quot;catch&quot; if the window is a tty (e.g. a serial
       line), otherwise it will use &quot;pass&quot;.
       You can define the templates screen uses in &quot;catch&quot; mode via  the  second
       and the third form.
       Note also that this is an experimental feature.

       zombie [keys[onerror]]
       defzombie [keys]

       Per  default  screen  windows are removed from the window list as soon as
       the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a  string  of  two  keys  is
       specified  to the zombie command, `dead&apos; windows will remain in the list.
       The kill command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the  first
       key in the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the second key,
       screen will attempt to resurrect the window. The process  that  was  ini&#8208;
       tially running in the window will be launched again. Calling zombie with&#8208;
       out parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus making windows  disap&#8208;
       pear when their process exits.

       As  the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows, this com&#8208;
       mand should only be called defzombie. Until we need this as a per  window
       setting, the commands zombie and defzombie are synonymous.

       Optionally you can put the word &quot;onerror&quot; after the keys. This will cause
       screen to monitor exit status of the process running in the window. If it
       exits  normally (&apos;0&apos;), the window disappears. Any other exit value causes
       the window to become a zombie.


THE MESSAGE LINE
       Screen displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a message
       line.   While  this  line  is  distributed to appear at the bottom of the
       screen, it can be defined to appear at the top of the screen during  com&#8208;
       pilation.   If  your  terminal  has a status line defined in its termcap,
       screen will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a line of the
       current  screen will be temporarily overwritten and output will be momen&#8208;
       tarily interrupted. The message line is automatically removed after a few
       seconds  delay,  but it can also be removed early (on terminals without a
       status line) by beginning to type.

       The message line facility can be used by an application  running  in  the
       current  window  by  means  of the ANSI Privacy message control sequence.
       For instance, from within the shell, try something like:

              echo &apos;&lt;esc&gt;^Hello world from window &apos;$WINDOW&apos;&lt;esc&gt;\\&apos;

       where &apos;&lt;esc&gt;&apos; is an escape, &apos;^&apos; is a literal  up-arrow,  and  &apos;\\&apos;  turns
       into a single backslash.


WINDOW TYPES
       Screen  provides  three  different  window types. New windows are created
       with screen&apos;s screen command (see also the entry in  chapter  &quot;CUSTOMIZA&#8208;
       TION&quot;).  The  first parameter to the screen command defines which type of
       window is created. The different window types are all  special  cases  of
       the normal type. They have been added in order to allow screen to be used
       efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more windows.


       &#183;  The normal window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is given)
          or  any other system command that could be executed from a shell (e.g.
          slogin, etc&#226;&#166;)


       &#183;  If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. &quot;/dev/ttya&quot;) is  speci&#8208;
          fied  as the first parameter, then the window is directly connected to
          this device.  This window type is similar to &quot;screen cu -l /dev/ttya&quot;.
          Read  and  write  access  is required on the device node, an exclusive
          open is attempted on the node to mark the connection line as busy.  An
          optional  parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated list of
          flags in the notation used by stty(1):

          &lt;baud_rate&gt;
                 Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission  as
                 well as receive speed.

          cs8 or cs7
                 Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.

          ixon or -ixon
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for
                 sending data.

          ixoff or -ixoff
                 Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving data.
&#12;          istrip or -istrip
                 Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.

          You may want to specify  as  many  of  these  options  as  applicable.
          Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to make up the parameter
          values of the connection.  These values are system dependent  and  may
          be in defaults or values saved from a previous connection.

          For  tty  windows,  the  info  command shows some of the modem control
          lines in the status line.  These  may  include  `RTS&apos;,  `CTS&apos;,  &apos;DTR&apos;,
          `DSR&apos;,  `CD&apos;  and  more.   This depends on the available ioctl()&apos;s and
          system header files as well as the on the physical capabilities of the
          serial board.  Signals that are logical low (inactive) have their name
          preceded by an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal  is  logical
          high (active).  Signals not supported by the hardware but available to
          the ioctl() interface are usually shown low.

          When the CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals  is
          placed inside curly braces ({ and }).  When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR
          bit is set, the signals  `CTS&apos;  or  `CD&apos;  are  shown  in  parenthesis,
          respectively.

          For  tty  windows, the command break causes the Data transmission line
          (TxD) to go low for a specified period of time. This is expected to be
          interpreted as break signal on the other side.  No data is sent and no
          modem control line is changed when a break is issued.


       &#183;  If the first parameter is &quot;//telnet&quot;, the second parameter is expected
          to  be  a host name, and an optional third parameter may specify a TCP
          port number (default decimal 23).  Screen will  connect  to  a  server
          listening  on  the remote host and use the telnet protocol to communi&#8208;
          cate with that server.
          For telnet windows, the command info shows details about  the  connec&#8208;
          tion in square brackets ([ and ]) at the end of the status line.

          b      BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.

          e      ECHO. Local echo is disabled.

          c      SGA.  The  connection  is  in  `character mode&apos; (default: `line
                 mode&apos;).

          t      TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the remote host.
                 Screen sends the name &quot;screen&quot; unless instructed otherwise (see
                 also the command `term&apos;).

          w      NAWS. The remote site is notified about window size changes.

          f      LFLOW. The remote host  will  send  flow  control  information.
                 (Ignored at the moment.)

          Additional  flags  for  debugging are x, t and n (XDISPLOC, TSPEED and
          NEWENV).

          For telnet windows, the command break sends the telnet code IAC  BREAK
          (decimal 243) to the remote host.


          This  window  type  is  only available if screen was compiled with the
          BUILTIN_TELNET option defined.



STRING ESCAPES
       Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like  the  cur&#8208;
       rent  time  into messages or file names. The escape character is &apos;%&apos; with
       one exception: inside of  a  window&apos;s  hardstatus  &apos;^%&apos;  (&apos;^E&apos;)  is  used
       instead.

       Here is the full list of supported escapes:

       %      the escape character itself

       a      either &apos;am&apos; or &apos;pm&apos;

       A      either &apos;AM&apos; or &apos;PM&apos;

       c      current time HH:MM in 24h format

       C      current time HH:MM in 12h format

       d      day number

       D      weekday name

       E      sets %? to true if the escape character has been pressed.
&#12;       f      flags  of  the  window,  see &quot;windows&quot; for meanings of the various
              flags

       F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus

       h      hardstatus of the window

       H      hostname of the system

       l      current load of the system

       m      month number

       M      month name

       n      window number

       P      sets %? to true if the current region is in copy/paste mode

       S      session name

       s      seconds

       t      window title

       u      all other users on this window

       w      all window numbers and names. With &apos;-&apos; qualifier: up to  the  cur&#8208;
              rent  window;  with  &apos;+&apos; qualifier: starting with the window after
              the current one.

       W      all window numbers and names except the current one

       y      last two digits of the year number

       Y      full year number

       ?      the part to the next &apos;%?&apos; is displayed only if a &apos;%&apos; escape inside
              the part expands to a non-empty string

       :      else part of &apos;%?&apos;

       =      pad  the  string  to  the display&apos;s width (like TeX&apos;s hfill). If a
              number is specified, pad to the percentage of the window&apos;s  width.
              A &apos;0&apos; qualifier tells screen to treat the number as absolute posi&#8208;
              tion.  You can specify to pad relative to the  last  absolute  pad
              position by adding a &apos;+&apos; qualifier or to pad relative to the right
              margin by using &apos;-&apos;. The padding truncates the string if the spec&#8208;
              ified position lies before the current position. Add the &apos;L&apos; qual&#8208;
              ifier to change this.

       &lt;      same as &apos;%=&apos; but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces

       &gt;      mark the current text  position  for  the  next  truncation.  When
              screen needs to do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the
              marked position gets moved to the specified percentage of the out&#8208;
              put area. (The area starts from the last absolute pad position and
              ends with the position specified by the truncation operator.)  The
              &apos;L&apos; qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated parts with &apos;&#226;&#166;&apos;.

       {      attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next &quot;}&quot;

       `      Substitute  with  the  output  of a &apos;backtick&apos; command. The length
              qualifier is misused to identify one of the commands.

       The &apos;c&apos; and &apos;C&apos; escape may be qualified with a &apos;0&apos;  to  make  screen  use
       zero instead of space as fill character. The &apos;0&apos; qualifier also makes the
       &apos;=&apos; escape use absolute positions. The &apos;n&apos; and &apos;=&apos; escapes  understand  a
       length  qualifier  (e.g.  &apos;%3n&apos;), &apos;D&apos; and &apos;M&apos; can be prefixed with &apos;L&apos; to
       generate long names, &apos;w&apos; and &apos;W&apos; also show the window  flags  if  &apos;L&apos;  is
       given.

       An  attribute/color  modifier  is is used to change the attributes or the
       color settings. Its format is &quot;[attribute modifier] [color description]&quot;.
       The  attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type indicator if it
       can be confused with a color description. The following change types  are
       known:

       +      add the specified set to the current attributes

       -      remove the set from the current attributes

       !      invert the set in the current attributes

       =      change the current attributes to the specified set

       The  attribute  set  can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a
       combination of the following letters:

       d      dim
       u      underline
       b      bold
       r      reverse
       s      standout
       B      blinking

       Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying
       the  desired background and foreground color (in that order). The follow&#8208;
       ing colors are known:

       k      black
       r      red
       g      green
       y      yellow
       b      blue
       m      magenta
       c      cyan
       w      white
       d      default color
       .      leave color unchanged

       The capitalized versions of the letter specify  bright  colors.  You  can
       also  use  the  pseudo-color &apos;i&apos; to set just the brightness and leave the
       color unchanged.
       A one digit/letter color description is treated as  foreground  or  back&#8208;
       ground color dependent on the current attributes: if reverse mode is set,
       the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.  If  you
       don&apos;t like this, prefix the color with a &quot;.&quot;. If you want the same behav&#8208;
       ior for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them with a &quot;.&quot;.
       As a special case, &quot;%{-}&quot; restores the attributes and  colors  that  were
       set  before  the last change was made (i.e., pops one level of the color-
       change stack).

       Examples:

       &quot;G&quot;    set color to bright green

       &quot;+b r&quot; use bold red

       &quot;= yd&quot; clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.

       %-Lw%{= BW}%50&gt;%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%&lt;
              The available windows centered at the current window and truncated
              to  the  available width. The current window is displayed white on
              blue.  This can be used with &quot;hardstatus alwayslastline&quot;.

       %?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?
              The window number and title and the window&apos;s hardstatus, if one is
              set.   Also use a red background if this is the active focus. Use&#8208;
              ful for &quot;caption string&quot;.

FLOW-CONTROL
       Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how  screen  deals
       with  the  XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps the interrupt character).
       When flow-control is turned off, screen ignores the XON and XOFF  charac&#8208;
       ters, which allows the user to send them to the current program by simply
       typing them (useful for the emacs editor, for instance).   The  trade-off
       is  that  it will take longer for output from a &quot;normal&quot; program to pause
       in response to an XOFF.  With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF  char&#8208;
       acters  are  used  to immediately pause the output of the current window.
       You can still send these characters to the current program, but you  must
       use  the  appropriate  two-character  screen  commands (typically &quot;C-a q&quot;
       (xon) and &quot;C-a s&quot; (xoff)).  The xon/xoff commands  are  also  useful  for
       typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that intercepts these characters.

       Each  window  has  an  initial  flow-control value set with either the -f
       option or the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command. Per default  the  windows  are
       set  to  automatic  flow-switching.   It  can then be toggled between the
       three states &apos;fixed on&apos;, &apos;fixed off&apos; and &apos;automatic&apos;  interactively  with
       the &quot;flow&quot; command bound to &quot;C-a f&quot;.

       The  automatic  flow-switching  mode  deals  with  flow control using the
       TIOCPKT mode (like &quot;rlogin&quot; does). If the tty  driver  does  not  support
       TIOCPKT,  screen  tries  to  find out the right mode based on the current
       setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled,  flow-control  is
       turned off and visa versa.  Of course, you can still manipulate flow-con&#8208;
       trol manually when needed.

       If you&apos;re running with flow-control enabled and find  that  pressing  the
       interrupt  key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until another
       6-8 lines have scrolled by,  try  running  screen  with  the  &quot;interrupt&quot;
       option (add the &quot;interrupt&quot; flag to the &quot;flow&quot; command in your .screenrc,
       or use the -i command-line option).  This causes the output  that  screen
       has  accumulated  from the interrupted program to be flushed.  One disad&#8208;
       vantage is that the virtual terminal&apos;s memory  contains  the  non-flushed
       version  of  the output, which in rare cases can cause minor inaccuracies
       in the output.  For example, if you switch screens and return, or  update
       the screen with &quot;C-a l&quot; you would see the version of the output you would
       have gotten without &quot;interrupt&quot; being on.  Also, you might need  to  turn
       off  flow-control  (or  use  auto-flow mode to turn it off automatically)
       when running a program that expects you to type the  interrupt  character
       as input, as it is possible to interrupt the output of the virtual termi&#8208;
       nal to your physical terminal when flow-control is enabled.  If this hap&#8208;
       pens,  a simple refresh of the screen with &quot;C-a l&quot; will restore it.  Give
       each mode a try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.



TITLES (naming windows)
       You can customize each window&apos;s name in the window display  (viewed  with
       the  &quot;windows&quot;  command (C-a w)) by setting it with one of the title com&#8208;
       mands.  Normally the name displayed is the actual  command  name  of  the
       program  created  in the window.  However, it is sometimes useful to dis&#8208;
       tinguish various programs of the same name or to change the name  on-the-
       fly to reflect the current state of the window.

       The  default  name for all shell windows can be set with the &quot;shelltitle&quot;
       command in the .screenrc file, while all other windows are created with a
       &quot;screen&quot;  command  and  thus  can have their name set with the -t option.
       Interactively,    there    is    the     title-string     escape-sequence
       (&lt;esc&gt;kname&lt;esc&gt;\)  and  the  &quot;title&quot; command (C-a A).  The former can be
       output from an application to control the window&apos;s  name  under  software
       control,  and the latter will prompt for a name when typed.  You can also
       bind pre-defined names to keys with the &quot;title&quot;  command  to  set  things
       quickly without prompting.

       Finally, screen has a shell-specific heuristic that is enabled by setting
       the window&apos;s name to &quot;search|name&quot; and arranging to  have  a  null  title
       escape-sequence  output  as  a  part  of your prompt.  The search portion
       specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while the name  portion  speci&#8208;
       fies  the  default  shell name for the window.  If the name ends in a `:&apos;
       screen will add what it believes to be the current command running in the
       window  to  the end of the window&apos;s shell name (e.g. &quot;name:cmd&quot;).  Other&#8208;
       wise the current command name supersedes the shell name while it is  run&#8208;
       ning.

       Here&apos;s  how it works:  you must modify your shell prompt to output a null
       title-escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;k&lt;esc&gt;\) as a part of your prompt.  The  last
       part  of your prompt must be the same as the string you specified for the
       search portion of the title.  Once this is set up, screen  will  use  the
       title-escape-sequence  to  clear  the previous command name and get ready
       for the next command.  Then, when a newline is received from the shell, a
       search  is  made  for  the end of the prompt.  If found, it will grab the
       first word after the matched string and use it as the command  name.   If
       the  command name begins with either &apos;!&apos;, &apos;%&apos;, or &apos;^&apos; screen will use the
       first word on the following line (if found) in preference  to  the  just-
       found name.  This helps csh users get better command names when using job
       control or history recall commands.

       Here&apos;s some .screenrc examples:

              screen -t top 2 nice top

       Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d  version  of  the
       &quot;top&quot; command in window 2 named &quot;top&quot; rather than &quot;nice&quot;.

                   shelltitle &apos;&gt; |csh&apos;
                   screen 1

       These  commands would start a shell with the given shelltitle.  The title
       specified is an auto-title that would expect the  prompt  and  the  typed
       command to look something like the following:

              /usr/joe/src/dir&gt; trn

       (it  looks after the &apos;&gt; &apos; for the command name).  The window status would
       show the name &quot;trn&quot; while the command was running, and  revert  to  &quot;csh&quot;
       upon completion.

              bind R screen -t &apos;% |root:&apos; su

       Having this command in your .screenrc would bind the key sequence &quot;C-a R&quot;
       to the &quot;su&quot; command and give it an auto-title name of &quot;root:&quot;.  For  this
       auto-title to work, the screen could look something like this:

                   % !em
                   emacs file.c

       Here  the  user  typed the csh history command &quot;!em&quot; which ran the previ&#8208;
       ously entered &quot;emacs&quot; command.  The window status would show &quot;root:emacs&quot;
       during  the execution of the command, and revert to simply &quot;root:&quot; at its
       completion.

                   bind o title
                   bind E title &quot;&quot;
                   bind u title (unknown)

       The first binding doesn&apos;t have any arguments, so it would prompt you  for
       a  title. when you type &quot;C-a o&quot;.  The second binding would clear an auto-
       title&apos;s current setting (C-a E).  The third binding would set the current
       window&apos;s title to &quot;(unknown)&quot; (C-a u).

       One  thing  to  keep  in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence to
       your prompt is that some shells (like the csh) count all the  non-control
       characters as part of the prompt&apos;s length.  If these invisible characters
       aren&apos;t a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a  tab  will  result  in  an
       incorrect  display.   One  way to get around this is to use a prompt like
       this:

              set prompt=&apos;^[[0000m^[k^[\% &apos;

       The escape-sequence  &quot;&lt;esc&gt;[0000m&quot;  not  only  normalizes  the  character
       attributes,  but  all the zeros round the length of the invisible charac&#8208;
       ters up to 8.  Bash users will probably want to echo the escape  sequence
       in the PROMPT_COMMAND:

              PROMPT_COMMAND=&apos;printf &quot;\033k\033\134&quot;&apos;

       (I used &quot;134&quot; to output a `\&apos; because of a bug in bash v1.04).



THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL
       Each  window  in  a  screen  session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some
       extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other  termi&#8208;
       nal types can be emulated.
       Usually  screen  tries  to  emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard as
       possible. But if your terminal lacks certain capabilities, the  emulation
       may  not  be complete. In these cases screen has to tell the applications
       that some of the features are missing. This is  no  problem  on  machines
       using  termcap, because screen can use the $TERMCAP variable to customize
       the standard screen termcap.

       But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your machine  supports  only
       terminfo  this method fails. Because of this, screen offers a way to deal
       with these cases.  Here is how it works:

       When screen tries to figure out a terminal  name  for  itself,  it  first
       looks for an entry named &quot;screen.&lt;term&gt;&quot;, where &lt;term&gt; is the contents of
       your $TERM variable.  If no such entry exists, screen tries &quot;screen&quot;  (or
       &quot;screen-w&quot;  if  the  terminal  is wide (132 cols or more)).  If even this
       entry cannot be found, &quot;vt100&quot; is used as a substitute.

       The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn&apos;t support  an  impor&#8208;
       tant feature (e.g. delete char or clear to EOS) you can build a new term&#8208;
       cap/terminfo entry for screen (named &quot;screen.&lt;dumbterm&gt;&quot;) in  which  this
       capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on your machines
       you are able to do a rlogin and still keep the  correct  termcap/terminfo
       entry.   The  terminal  name is put in the $TERM variable of all new win&#8208;
       dows.  Screen also sets the $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities
       of the virtual terminal emulated. Notice that, however, on machines using
       the terminfo database this variable  has  no  effect.   Furthermore,  the
       variable $WINDOW is set to the window number of each window.

       The  actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual terminal depends
       on  the  capabilities  supported  by  the  physical  terminal.   If,  for
       instance,  the physical terminal does not support underscore mode, screen
       does not put the `us&apos; and `ue&apos; capabilities into  the  window&apos;s  $TERMCAP
       variable, accordingly.  However, a minimum number of capabilities must be
       supported by a terminal in order to run screen; namely  scrolling,  clear
       screen, and direct cursor addressing (in addition, screen does not run on
       hardcopy terminals or on terminals that over-strike).

       Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by screen  by  using  the
       &quot;termcap&quot; .screenrc command, or by defining the variable $SCREENCAP prior
       to startup.  When the is latter defined, its value will be copied  verba&#8208;
       tim  into  each  window&apos;s $TERMCAP variable.  This can either be the full
       terminal definition, or a filename where the  terminal  &quot;screen&quot;  (and/or
       &quot;screen-w&quot;) is defined.

       Note  that  screen  honors the &quot;terminfo&quot; .screenrc command if the system
       uses the terminfo database rather than termcap.

       When the boolean `G0&apos; capability is present in the termcap entry for  the
       terminal  on  which  screen  has  been  called, the terminal emulation of
       screen supports multiple character sets.  This allows an  application  to
       make  use  of, for instance, the VT100 graphics character set or national
       character sets.  The following control functions from ISO 2022  are  sup&#8208;
       ported: lock shift G0 (SI), lock shift G1 (SO), lock shift G2, lock shift
       G3, single shift G2, and single shift G3.  When  a  virtual  terminal  is
       created or reset, the ASCII character set is designated as G0 through G3.
       When the `G0&apos; capability is present, screen  evaluates  the  capabilities
       `S0&apos;,  `E0&apos;,  and `C0&apos; if present. `S0&apos; is the sequence the terminal uses
       to enable and start the graphics character set rather than SI.   `E0&apos;  is
       the corresponding replacement for SO. `C0&apos; gives a character by character
       translation string that is used during semi-graphics mode. This string is
       built like the `acsc&apos; terminfo capability.

       When the `po&apos; and `pf&apos; capabilities are present in the terminal&apos;s termcap
       entry, applications running in a screen window can  send  output  to  the
       printer  port of the terminal.  This allows a user to have an application
       in one window sending output to a  printer  connected  to  the  terminal,
       while all other windows are still active (the printer port is enabled and
       disabled again for each chunk of output).   As  a  side-effect,  programs
       running  in  different  windows can send output to the printer simultane&#8208;
       ously.  Data sent to the printer is not displayed  in  the  window.   The
       info command displays a line starting `PRIN&apos; while the printer is active.

       Screen  maintains  a  hardstatus  line for every window. If a window gets
       selected, the display&apos;s hardstatus will be updated to match the  window&apos;s
       hardstatus  line.  If the display has no hardstatus the line will be dis&#8208;
       played as a standard screen message.  The hardstatus line can be  changed
       with the ANSI Application Program Command (APC): &quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\&quot;. As a
       convenience for xterm users the sequence  &quot;ESC]0..2;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot;  is  also
       accepted.

       Some  capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP variable of the virtual
       terminal if they can be efficiently implemented by the physical terminal.
       For  instance,  `dl&apos; (delete line) is only put into the $TERMCAP variable
       if the terminal supports either delete line itself or scrolling  regions.
       Note that this may provoke confusion, when the session is reattached on a
       different terminal, as the value of $TERMCAP cannot be modified by parent
       processes.

       The  &quot;alternate  screen&quot;  capability  is not enabled by default.  Set the
       altscreen .screenrc command to enable it.

INPUT TRANSLATION
       In  order  to  do  a  full  VT100  emulation  screen has to detect that a
       sequence of characters in the input stream was generated by a keypress on
       the  user&apos;s  keyboard  and insert the VT100 style escape sequence. Screen
       has a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible to map  arbi&#8208;
       trary  commands  on arbitrary sequences of characters. For standard VT100
       emulation the command will always insert a string in the input buffer  of
       the  window  (see  also command stuff in the command table).  Because the
       sequences generated by a keypress can change after a reattach from a dif&#8208;
       ferent terminal type, it is possible to bind commands to the termcap name
       of the keys.  Screen will insert the correct binding after each reattach.
       See the bindkey command for further details on the syntax and examples.

       Here is the table of the default key bindings. (A) means that the command
       is executed if the keyboard is switched into application mode.

SPECIAL TERMINAL CAPABILITIES
       The following table describes all terminal capabilities that  are  recog&#8208;
       nized  by  screen  and  are  not in the termcap(5) manual.  You can place
       these capabilities in your termcap entries  (in  `/etc/termcap&apos;)  or  use
       them  with  the  commands `termcap&apos;, `terminfo&apos; and `termcapinfo&apos; in your
       screenrc files. It is often not possible to place these  capabilities  in
       the terminfo database.

       LP   (bool)  Terminal  has  VT100  style  margins (`magic margins&apos;). Note
                    that this capability is obsolete  because  screen  uses  the
                    standard &apos;xn&apos; instead.

       Z0   (str)   Change width to 132 columns.

       Z1   (str)   Change width to 80 columns.

       WS   (str)   Resize  display.  This  capability has the desired width and
                    height as arguments. SunView(tm) example: &apos;\E[8;%d;%dt&apos;.

       NF   (bool)  Terminal doesn&apos;t need flow control. Send ^S and ^Q direct to
                    the  application.  Same  as &apos;flow off&apos;. The opposite of this
                    capability is &apos;nx&apos;.

       G0   (bool)  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022 font selection sequences.

       S0   (str)   Switch charset &apos;G0&apos; to the  specified  charset.  Default  is
                    &apos;\E(%.&apos;.

       E0   (str)   Switch  charset  &apos;G0&apos;  back  to standard charset. Default is
                    &apos;\E(B&apos;.

       C0   (str)   Use the string as a conversion table for font &apos;0&apos;.  See  the
                    &apos;ac&apos; capability for more details.

       CS   (str)   Switch cursor-keys to application mode.

       CE   (str)   Switch cursor-keys back to normal mode.

       AN   (bool)  Turn  on  autonuke.  See  the  &apos;autonuke&apos;  command  for more
                    details.

       OL   (num)   Set the output buffer limit. See the &apos;obuflimit&apos; command for
                    more details.

       KJ   (str)   Set the encoding of the terminal. See the &apos;encoding&apos; command
                    for valid encodings.

       AF   (str)   Change character foreground color in an  ANSI  conform  way.
                    This  capability  will  almost  always  be  set to &apos;\E[3%dm&apos;
                    (&apos;\E[3%p1%dm&apos; on terminfo machines).

       AB   (str)   Same as &apos;AF&apos;, but change background color.

       AX   (bool)  Does understand ANSI  set  default  fg/bg  color  (\E[39m  /
                    \E[49m).

       XC   (str)   Describe a translation of characters to strings depending on
                    the current font. More details follow in the next section.

       XT   (bool)  Terminal understands special  xterm  sequences  (OSC,  mouse
                    tracking).

       C8   (bool)  Terminal  needs  bold to display high-intensity colors (e.g.
                    Eterm).

       TF   (bool)  Add missing capabilities to the termcap/info entry. (Set  by
                    default).


CHARACTER TRANSLATION
       Screen  has  a  powerful  mechanism  to translate characters to arbitrary
       strings depending on the current font and terminal type.  Use  this  fea&#8208;
       ture  if  you  want  to  work  with  a common standard character set (say
       ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more  unusual  charac&#8208;
       ters over several national language font pages.

       Syntax:
           XC=&lt;charset-mapping&gt;{,,&lt;charset-mapping&gt;}
           &lt;charset-mapping&gt; := &lt;designator&gt;&lt;template&gt;{,&lt;mapping&gt;}
           &lt;mapping&gt; := &lt;char-to-be-mapped&gt;&lt;template-arg&gt;

       The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.
&#12;       A  &lt;charset-mapping&gt; tells screen how to map characters in font &lt;designa&#8208;
       tor&gt; (&apos;B&apos;: Ascii, &apos;A&apos;: UK, &apos;K&apos;: German, etc.)  to  strings.  Every  &lt;map&#8208;
       ping&gt;  describes  to what string a single character will be translated. A
       template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes have a  lot  in
       common  (for example strings to switch to and from another charset). Each
       occurrence of &apos;%&apos; in &lt;template&gt; gets substituted with the  &lt;template-arg&gt;
       specified together with the character. If your strings are not similar at
       all, then use &apos;%&apos; as a template and place the full string  in  &lt;template-
       arg&gt;.  A  quoting  mechanism  was added to make it possible to use a real
       &apos;%&apos;. The &apos;\&apos; character quotes the special characters &apos;\&apos;, &apos;%&apos;, and &apos;,&apos;.

       Here is an example:

           termcap hp700 &apos;XC=B\E(K%\E(B,\304[,\326\\\\,\334]&apos;

       This tells screen how to translate ISOlatin1  (charset  &apos;B&apos;)  upper  case
       umlaut  characters  on a hp700 terminal that has a German charset. &apos;\304&apos;
       gets translated to &apos;\E(K[\E(B&apos; and so  on.   Note  that  this  line  gets
       parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built, therefore
       a lot of quoting is needed to create a single &apos;\&apos;.

       Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping  trans&#8208;
       lates  the  unquoted  &apos;%&apos;  char, it will be sent to the terminal whenever
       screen switches to the corresponding &lt;designator&gt;. In this  special  case
       the  template  is  assumed  to  be  just  &apos;%&apos;  because the charset switch
       sequence and the character mappings normally haven&apos;t much in common.

       This example shows one use of the extension:

           termcap xterm &apos;XC=K%,%\E(B,[\304,\\\\\326,]\334&apos;

       Here, a part of the German (&apos;K&apos;) charset is emulated  on  an  xterm.   If
       screen  has to change to the &apos;K&apos; charset, &apos;\E(B&apos; will be sent to the ter&#8208;
       minal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The template is just  &apos;%&apos;,
       so  the mapping is straightforward: &apos;[&apos; to &apos;\304&apos;, &apos;\&apos; to &apos;\326&apos;, and &apos;]&apos;
       to &apos;\334&apos;.

VERSION
       This  is  version 4.1.0. Its roots are a merge of a custom version 2.3PR7
       by Wayne Davison and several enhancements  to  Oliver  Laumann&apos;s  version
       2.0. Note that all versions numbered 2.x are copyright by Oliver Laumann.

AVAILABILITY
       The  latest  official  release of screen available via anonymous ftp from
       gnudist.gnu.org, nic.funet.fi or any other  GNU  distribution  site.  The
       home  site  of screen is ftp.uni-erlangen.de, in the directory pub/utili&#8208;
       ties/screen. The subdirectory `private&apos; contains the latest beta  testing
       release. If you want to help, send a note to screen@uni-erlangen.de.

BUGS
       &#183;  `dm&apos;  (delete  mode)  and  `xs&apos;  are  not  handled correctly (they are
          ignored). `xn&apos; is treated as a magic-margin indicator.

       &#183;  Screen has no clue about double-high or double-wide  characters.   But
          this is the only area where vttest is allowed to fail.

       &#183;  It  is  not  possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when
          reattaching under a different terminal type.

       &#183;  The support of terminfo based systems is very  limited.  Adding  extra
          capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.

       &#183;  Screen does not make use of hardware tabs.

       &#183;  Screen must be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems in
          order to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty device  file
          for each window.  Special permission may also be required to write the
          file &quot;/var/run/utmp&quot;.

       &#183;  Entries in &quot;/var/run/utmp&quot; are not removed when screen is killed  with
          SIGKILL.  This will cause some programs (like &quot;w&quot; or &quot;rwho&quot;) to adver&#8208;
          tise that a user is logged on who really isn&apos;t.

       &#183;  Screen may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.

       &#183;  When the modem line was hung up, screen may not  automatically  detach
          (or quit) unless the device driver is configured to send a HANGUP sig&#8208;
          nal.  To detach a screen session use the -D or -d command line option.

       &#183;  If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still  detach
          a session without asking.

       &#183;  Both &quot;breaktype&quot; and &quot;defbreaktype&quot; change the break generating method
          used by all terminal devices. The first should change  a  window  spe&#8208;
          cific setting, where the latter should change only the default for new
          windows.

       &#183;  When attaching to a multiuser session, the user&apos;s  .screenrc  file  is
          not  sourced. Each user&apos;s personal settings have to be included in the
          .screenrc file from which the session is booted, or have to be changed
          manually.
