SCREENDUMP(1)                     Linux Console                    SCREENDUMP(1)



NAME
       screendump - dump the contents of a virtual console to stdout


SYNOPSIS
       screendump [ N ]


DESCRIPTION
       The  screendump command dumps the contents of virtual console N , (or the
       current console if N is omitted) to standard out.

       Just saying
              cat /dev/vcsN
       has a similar effect.


NOTES
       For security reasons, screendump  uses  linux  devices  &quot;virtual  console
       screen&quot;  and  &quot;virtual console screen with attributes&quot; to give access for
       screendump.

       Ensure these files exist, using

              cd /dev for i in 0 1 2 3 ...; do
                   mknod vcs$i c 7 $i
                   mknod vcsa$i c 7 `expr 128 + $i`
              done

       (filling in the ellipses) and give the device files  appropriate  permis&#8208;
       sions, or run screendump as root.
