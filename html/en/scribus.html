NAME
       scribus - cross platform WYSIWYG desktop publishing app

SYNOPSIS
       scribus  [-h|--help]  [-v|--version]  [-l|--lang  language] [-la|--langs-
       available] [-f|--file|--] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Scribus is an open source desktop publishing program.  It  provides  true
       WYSIWYG  editing,  excellent  PDF  export facilities, and a wide range of
       other input and output options.

       Please see the scribus documentation at http://docs.scribus.net/  or  the
       program&apos;s  built in help for more comprehensive and up-to-date documenta&#8208;
       tion.

       This man page only provides summaries of some aspects  of  the  program&apos;s
       use.  It&apos;s  main purpose is to make sure you can find the full documenta&#8208;
       tion quickly and easily.

OPTIONS
       The definitive options are in the program&apos;s usage statement. Run: scribus
       --help to view the usage statement.


       -l, --lang xx
              Overrides  the  system locale and runs Scribus in language xx. The
              language is specified with the same POSIX language codes that  are
              used  in  the  LANG and LC_ALL environment variables. For example,
              English can be  selected  with  &apos;en&apos;  (generic  English),  &apos;en_GB&apos;
              (British  English),  &apos;en_US&apos;  (American  english), etc. Similarly,
              Deutsch can be selected with &apos;de&apos; or &apos;de_DE&apos;.

       -la, --langs-available
              Print a list of languages for which  user  interface  translations
              are available. To use that language run Scribus as &apos;scribus -l xx&apos;
              where xx is the short language code, or set the locale environment
              variables as described below.

       -v, --version
              Prints the Scribus version number and exits.

       -f, --file
              Open  the  specified  file.  It&apos;s possible to simply pass the file
              name as an unqualified argument instead of using this,  though  if
              the  name  begins with a - you will need to use --, eg &apos;scribus --
              -myfile.sla&apos;.

       -h, --help
              Print a brief usage summary.

       -fi, --font-info
              Shows the font file listing as Scribus starts. This  can  be  used
              for diagnosing missing glyphs within fonts or possible broken font
              files.

       -pi, --profile-info
              Shows the color profiles listing which Scribus can use.  This  can
              be used for diagnosing missing or broken color profiles.

       -ns, --no-splash
              Suppresses display of the splash screen during Scribus start-up.
&#12;       -nns, --never-splash
              Stop  the  showing of the splashscreen on startup. Writes an empty
              file called .neversplash in ~/.scribus.

       -sb, --swap-buttons
              Use right  to  left  dialog  button  ordering  (eg.  Cancel/No/Yes
              instead of Yes/No/Cancel)

       -u, --upgradecheck
              Downloads  a file from our scribus server indicating latest avail&#8208;
              able versions.


ENVIRONMENT
       Scribus respects the standard locale environment variables. Others may be
       used  through  underlying  libraries,  such as Qt, or by programs used by
       Scribus.  http://docs.scribus.net/ and the in-program  documentation  may
       note  other  environment  variables  used  by Scribus or the programs and
       libraries it uses.

       LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG
              POSIX locale. See locale(1).  Scribus uses these three environment
              variables,  in  the listed order of precedence, to select the lan&#8208;
              guage (including the user interface translation) to use.  If  none
              are  set, it will fall back on the locale set by the underlying Qt
              library.

       PATH   Scribus may search the PATH for external tools if their paths  are
              not  specified absolutely. This is currently most likely to affect
              you if you have multiple copies of gs(1) installed. You can set an
              absolute path to the correct gs(1) in your Scribus preferences and
              bypass the PATH search.

       A few important environment variables from other programs are  summarised
       here for convenience, though you should check the original program&apos;s doc&#8208;
       umentation if you are having trouble.

       GS_FONTPATH
              GhostScript font path. Affects the font  search  path  for  Ghost&#8208;
              Script,  a  component Scribus uses for some PostScript operations.
              Add new directories containing fonts to this colon-separated  list
              to  help  GhostScript  find  fonts  in non-standard locations. See
              gs(1) and the GhostScript HTML documentation for more information.

       GS_LIB GhostScript library  path.  GhostScript  searches  this  path  for
              Fontmap  files.  Like  GS_FONTPATH  it&apos;s a colon separated list of
              directories. You will usually want  to  use  GS_FONTPATH  instead,
              though  building  a Fontmap file and using GS_LIB can speed things
              up if you have a lot of fonts. See gs(1) and the GhostScript  HTML
              documentation for more information.

FILES
       $HOME/.scribus/
              User  preferences are stored in $HOME/.scribus/ on Unix or Linux .
              Most other paths are configurable from  the  Scribus  preferences.
              Scribus 1.3 preferences are separate from Scribus 1.2.x User pref&#8208;
              erences for Mac OS X, OS/2 and Windows are documented in the  help
              docs (F1) in Scribus.  $HOME/.scribus/scribus13.rc Scribus prefer&#8208;
              ences file - formatted in a custom xml schema. May  eventually  be
              retired     in     favour    of    new    format    prefs    file.
              $HOME/.scribus/prefs13.xml Scribus 1.3.8 preferences are  separate
              from Scribus 1.3.3.x

       $HOME/.fonts/

       $HOME/.fonts.conf

       /etc/fonts
              Fontconfig,  the  library used by Scribus to locate fonts, is nor&#8208;
              mally   configured    with    files    in    /etc/fonts,    mainly
              /etc/fonts/fonts.conf  and /etc/fonts/local.conf . It may also use
              a config file $HOME/.fonts.conf and fonts in $HOME/.fonts/  .  See
              fonts.conf(5)  and  the fontconfig documentation for more informa&#8208;
              tion. Note that Scribus may also use its  internal  font  path  to
              locate more fonts - see the Preferences dialog and scribus help.
