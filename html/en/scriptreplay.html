NAME
       scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information

SYNOPSIS
       scriptreplay [options] [-t] timingfile [typescript [divisor]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure
       that output happens at the same speed as it originally appeared when the
       script was recorded.

       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were
       run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.  Since the
       same information is simply being displayed, scriptreplay is only guaran&#8208;
       teed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript
       was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may
       be interpreted differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is send&#8208;
       ing its output.

       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to standard error if it
       is run with the -t parameter.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named &quot;type&#8208;
       script&quot;, but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or
       with option -s.

       If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier.
       For example, a speed-up of 2 makes scriptreplay go twice as fast, and a
       speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the original session.

OPTIONS
       The first three options will overide old-style arguments.

       -t, --timing file
              File containing script timing output.

       -s, --typescript file
              File containing the script terminal output.

       -d, --divisor number
              Speed up the replay displaying this number of times.  The argument
              is a floating point number.  It&apos;s called divisor because it
              divides the timings by this factor.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

EXAMPLE
        % script -t 2&gt; timingfile
        Script started, file is typescript
        % ls
        &lt;etc, etc&gt;
        % exit
        Script done, file is typescript
        % scriptreplay timingfile
