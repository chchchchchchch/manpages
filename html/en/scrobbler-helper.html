NAME
       scrobbler-helper - submit a track to AudioScrobbler

SYNOPSIS
        scrobbler-helper [-nv] [-e encoding] [-f configfile] -P progname
          -V progver title artist album year comment genre length

DESCRIPTION
       The scrobbler-helper utility uses the &quot;Audio::Scrobbler&quot; module to submit
       a single track&apos;s information to Last.fm&apos;s AudioScrobbler -
       http://www.audioscrobbler.com/.  It requires the program (plug-in) name
       and version to be specified on the command line, and also requires all
       seven track attributes, although some of them may be omitted by supplying
       empty strings.

       The following command-line options are recognized:

       -e encoding
           Specify the character encoding of the track info, if it is neither
           UTF-8 nor the one specified via default_encoding in the configuration
           file.

       -f configfile
           Specify a different configuration file, not ~/.scrobbler-helper.conf.

       -n  Do not actually perform the handshake and submission (sets the
           &quot;Audio::Scrobbler&quot; &quot;fake&quot; option).

       -P progname
           Specify the name of the AudioScrobbler plug-in submitting the data.
           This option is mandatory!

       -v  Verbose operation - display diagnostic messages to the standard out&#8208;
           put (sets the &quot;Audio::Scrobbler&quot; &quot;verbose&quot; option).

       -V progver
           Specify the version of the AudioScrobbler plug-in submitting the
           data.  This option is mandatory!

       Besides the command line, the scrobbler-helper utility also retrieves
       information from a per-user configuration file, usually ~/.scrob&#8208;
       bler-helper.conf; it is a INI-style file, which must contain a secion
       named &quot;global&quot;.  The following variables are recognized, with username
       and password being mandatory:

       * default_encoding
           The encoding to assume for the track info, if none is supplied with
           the -e command-line option.  If neither -e is given on the command
           line nor default_encoding specified in the configuration file, the
           scrobbler-helper utility assumes UTF-8.

       * fix_track_name
           A boolean flag specifying whether to do some trivial fixes on the
           song name before submitting it.  Currently, this only removes a &quot;DD.
           &quot; sequence at the start of the name, where &apos;D&apos; is a digit.

           The values &quot;on&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, and 1 are considered to be true.

       * password
           The password for the AudioScrobbler account.

       * username
           The username for the AudioScrobbler account.
&#12;         [global]
         username=jrandomlistener
         password=mylittlesecret
         # Optional (the default is UTF-8)
         default_encoding=windows-1251
         # Optional (the default is &quot;no&quot;)
         fix_track_name=yes

TODO
       &#183;   Command-line options, so people don&apos;t have to submit everything...

       &#183;   Storing and caching of unsuccessful submissions for later retrying.
