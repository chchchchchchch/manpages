sdl-config(1)                                                      sdl-config(1)



NAME
       sdl-config - script to get information about the installed version of SDL

SYNOPSIS
       sdl-config  [ --prefix= DIR] [ --exec-prefix= DIR] [ --version ] [ --libs
       | --library-libs | --plugin-libs ] [ --cflags ]

DESCRIPTION
       sdl-config is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler
       and  linker  flags  that  should  be  used  to compile and link programs,
       libraries, and plugins that use SDL.  It is also used internally  by  the
       m4 macros that are included with SDL.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Print  the  compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program
              or library that uses SDL.

       --exec-prefix=DIR
              If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that
              SDL  was  build  with  when computing the output for the --cflags,
              --libs, --library-libs, and --plugin-libs  options.   This  option
              must  be  specified before any of the --cflags, --libs, --library-
              libs, and --plugin-libs options.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a  program  that
              uses SDL.

       --static-libs
              Print  the  linker  flags  that are necessary to statically link a
              program that uses SDL.

       --library-libs
              Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a  library  that
              uses SDL.  (This excludes any static objects required for linking,
              since these must be linked only by executable programs.)

       --plugin-libs
              Print the linker flags that are necessary  to  link  an  SDL-using
              object  that  is  to  be accessed via dlopen(3).  This may include
              static objects with PIC symbol information.   This  option  should
              not  be  used for ordinary shared libraries or standalone applica&#8208;
              tions.

       --prefix=DIR
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation  prefix  that
              SDL  was  built  with  when computing the output for the --cflags,
              --libs, --library-libs, and --plugin-libs options.  This option is
              also  used for the exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified.
              This option must be specified before any of the --cflags,  --libs,
              --library-libs, and --plugin-libs options.

       --version
              Prints the currently installed version of SDL on standard output.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(sdl-config --cflags) main.c
              is  how you might use sdl-config to compile a C source file for an
              executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(sdl-config --libs) main.o util.o
              is how you might use sdl-config to link compiled objects  into  an
              executable program.

       gcc  -o  libSDL_nifty-1.2.so.0.0.1  $(sdl  --library-libs) read.o write.o
       munge.o
              is how you might use sdl-config to link compiled  objects  into  a
              shared library.

       gcc  -o  libnifty_xmms.so  $(sdl  --plugin-libs) stream.o blit.o deinter&#8208;
       lace.o
              is how you might use sdl-config to link compiled  objects  into  a
              plugin for use by another program.
