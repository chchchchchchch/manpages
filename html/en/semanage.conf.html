NAME
       semanage.conf  -  global  configuration  file  for the SELinux Management
       library

DESCRIPTION
       The  semanage.conf  file  is  usually   located   under   the   directory
       /etc/selinux and it is used for run-time configuration of the behavior of
       the SELinux Management library.


       Each line should contain a configuration parameter followed by the  equal
       sign  (&quot;=&quot;) and then followed by the configuration value for that parame&#8208;
       ter. Anything after the &quot;#&quot; symbol is ignored similarly to empty lines.


       The following parameters are allowed:


              module-store
                     Specify how the SELinux Management library should  interact
                     with  the  SELinux  policy store. When set to &quot;direct&quot;, the
                     SELinux Management library writes  to  the  SELinux  policy
                     module  store directly (this is the default setting).  Oth&#8208;
                     erwise a socket path or a server name can be used  for  the
                     argument.    If   the  argument  begins  with  &quot;/&quot;  (as  in
                     &quot;/foo/bar&quot;), it represents the path to a named socket  that
                     should be used to connect the policy management server.  If
                     the  argument  does  not  begin   with   a   &quot;/&quot;   (as   in
                     &quot;foo.com:4242&quot;),  it should be interpreted as the name of a
                     remote policy management server to be used  through  a  TCP
                     connection  (default port is 4242 unless a different one is
                     specified after the server name using the colon to separate
                     the two fields).


              policy-version
                     When  generating  the  policy, by default semanage will set
                     the policy version to POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as  defined  in
                     &lt;sepol/policydb/policydb.h&gt;.  Change this setting if a dif&#8208;
                     ferent version needs to be set for the policy.


              expand-check
                     Whether or not to check &quot;neverallow&quot; rules  when  executing
                     all  semanage  command.  It  can be set to either &quot;0&quot; (dis&#8208;
                     abled) or &quot;1&quot; (enabled) and by default it is enabled. There
                     might  be  a large penalty in execution time if this option
                     is enabled.


              file-mode
                     By default the permission  mode  for  the  run-time  policy
                     files is set to 0644.


              save-previous
                     It  controls whether the previous module directory is saved
                     after a successful commit to the policy store and it can be
                     set  to  either  &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. By default it is set to
                     &quot;false&quot; (the previous version is deleted).
&#12;              save-linked
                     It controls whether the previously linked module  is  saved
                     (with  name &quot;base.linked&quot;) after a successful commit to the
                     policy store.  It can be set to either  &quot;true&quot;  or  &quot;false&quot;
                     and by default it is set to &quot;false&quot; (the previous module is
                     deleted).


              ignoredirs
                     List, separated by &quot;;&quot;,  of directories to ignore when set&#8208;
                     ting  up  users  homedirs.   Some distributions use this to
                     stop labeling /root as a homedir.


              usepasswd
                     Whether or not to enable the use  getpwent()  to  obtain  a
                     list  of home directories to label. It can be set to either
                     &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  By default it is set to &quot;true&quot;.


              disable-genhomedircon
                     It controls whether or not the  genhomedircon  function  is
                     executed  when using the semanage command and it can be set
                     to either &quot;false&quot; or &quot;true&quot;. By default  the  genhomedircon
                     functionality  is enabled (equivalent to this option set to
                     &quot;false&quot;).


              handle-unknown
                     This option controls the kernel behavior for handling  per&#8208;
                     missions  defined in the kernel but missing from the actual
                     policy.  It can be set to &quot;deny&quot;, &quot;reject&quot; or &quot;allow&quot;.


              bzip-blocksize
                     It should be in the range 0-9. A value of 0 means  no  com&#8208;
                     pression.  By  default  the  bzip  block  size  is set to 9
                     (actual block size value is obtained  after  multiplication
                     by 100000).


              bzip-small
                     When  set to &quot;true&quot;, the bzip algorithm shall try to reduce
                     its system memory usage. It can be set to either &quot;true&quot;  or
                     &quot;false&quot; and by default it is set to &quot;false&quot;.
