SENDFILE(2)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                SENDFILE(2)



NAME
       sendfile - transfer data between file descriptors

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;

       ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       sendfile()  copies data between one file descriptor and another.  Because
       this copying is done within the kernel, sendfile() is more efficient than
       the combination of read(2) and write(2), which would require transferring
       data to and from user space.

       in_fd should be a file descriptor opened for reading and out_fd should be
       a descriptor opened for writing.

       If offset is not NULL, then it points to a variable holding the file off&#8208;
       set from which sendfile() will start reading data from in_fd.  When send&#8208;
       file()  returns, this variable will be set to the offset of the byte fol&#8208;
       lowing the last byte that was read.  If offset is not  NULL,  then  send&#8208;
       file()  does  not  modify the current file offset of in_fd; otherwise the
       current file offset is adjusted to reflect the number of bytes read  from
       in_fd.

       If offset is NULL, then data will be read from in_fd starting at the cur&#8208;
       rent file offset, and the file offset will be updated by the call.

       count is the number of bytes to copy between the file descriptors.

       The in_fd argument must correspond to a file which supports  mmap(2)-like
       operations (i.e., it cannot be a socket).

       In  Linux  kernels  before  2.6.33, out_fd must refer to a socket.  Since
       Linux 2.6.33 it can be any file.  If it is a  regular  file,  then  send&#8208;
       file() changes the file offset appropriately.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the transfer was successful, the number of bytes written to out_fd is
       returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN Nonblocking I/O has been selected using O_NONBLOCK and  the  write
              would block.

       EBADF  The  input  file was not opened for reading or the output file was
              not opened for writing.

       EFAULT Bad address.

       EINVAL Descriptor is not valid or locked, or an mmap(2)-like operation is
              not available for in_fd.

       EIO    Unspecified error while reading from in_fd.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to read from in_fd.

VERSIONS
       sendfile()  is  a  new feature in Linux 2.2.  The include file &lt;sys/send&#8208;
       file.h&gt; is present since glibc 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       Not specified in POSIX.1-2001, or other standards.
&#12;       Other UNIX systems implement sendfile() with different semantics and pro&#8208;
       totypes.  It should not be used in portable programs.

NOTES
       If you plan to use sendfile() for sending files to a TCP socket, but need
       to send some header data in front of the file contents, you will find  it
       useful  to  employ  the TCP_CORK option, described in tcp(7), to minimize
       the number of packets and to tune performance.

       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, out_fd could also refer to a regular file,  and
       sendfile() changed the current offset of that file.

       The  original  Linux  sendfile()  system  call was not designed to handle
       large file offsets.  Consequently, Linux 2.4 added sendfile64(),  with  a
       wider  type  for the offset argument.  The glibc sendfile() wrapper func&#8208;
       tion transparently deals with the kernel differences.

       Applications may wish to fall back to read(2)/write(2) in the case  where
       sendfile() fails with EINVAL or ENOSYS.

       The  Linux-specific  splice(2)  call  supports  transferring data between
       arbitrary files (e.g., a pair of sockets).
