NAME
       sensors-conf-convert  -  convert sensors.conf from lm-sensors 2 format to
       lm-sensors 3 format

SYNOPSIS
       sensors-conf-convert &lt; /etc/sensors.conf &gt; /etc/sensors3.conf

DESCRIPTION
       sensors-conf-convert converts a sensors.conf file  from  the  old  (Linux
       2.4, lm-sensors 2) symbol names to the new (Linux 2.6, lm-sensors 3) sym&#8208;
       bol names.

       Implemented conversions:

       - The &quot;algorithm name&quot; part of bus statements is removed.

       - Bus statements for the ISA bus are removed.

       - Chip names containing dashes are removed.

       - Label, ignore, set and compute statements referencing features
              which are not part of the new interface are removed.

       - Label, ignore, set and compute statements referencing features
              which have been renamed are updated. This  includes  both  general
              feature name changes and chip-specific feature name changes.
