SENSORS-DETECT(8)                                              SENSORS-DETECT(8)



NAME
       sensors-detect - detect hardware monitoring chips


SYNOPSIS
       sensors-detect


DESCRIPTION
       sensors-detect  is  an interactive program that will walk you through the
       process of scanning your system for various hardware monitoring chips, or
       sensors,  supported by libsensors(3), or more generally by the lm_sensors
       tool suite.

       sensors-detect will look for the following devices, in order:

       &#183;      Sensors embedded in CPUs, south bridges and memory controllers.

       &#183;      Sensors embedded in Super I/O chips.

       &#183;      Hardware monitoring chips accessed through ISA I/O ports.

       &#183;      Hardware monitoring chips reachable over the SMBus or more  gener&#8208;
              ally any I2C bus on your system.

       As  the  last two detection steps can cause trouble on some systems, they
       are normally not attempted if the second detection step led to  the  dis&#8208;
       covery  of  a  Super I/O chip with complete hardware monitoring features.
       However, the user is always free to ask for all detection steps if so  is
       his/her  wish.  This  can  be  useful if a given system has more than one
       hardware monitoring chip. Some vendors are known to do this, most notably
       Asus and Tyan.


WARNING
       sensors-detect  needs  to access the hardware for most of the chip detec&#8208;
       tions.  By definition, it doesn&apos;t know which chips are  there  before  it
       manages  to  identify  them. This means that it can access chips in a way
       these chips do not like, causing problems ranging from  SMBus  lockup  to
       permanent hardware damage (a rare case, thankfully.)

       The  authors  made  their best to make the detection as safe as possible,
       and it turns out to work just fine in most cases, however it is  impossi&#8208;
       ble  to  guarantee  that  sensors-detect will not lock or kill a specific
       system. So, as a rule of thumb, you should not run sensors-detect on pro&#8208;
       duction  servers,  and  you should not run sensors-detect if can&apos;t afford
       replacing a random part of your system. Also, it is  recommended  to  not
       force  a  detection step which would have been skipped by default, unless
       you know what you are doing.
