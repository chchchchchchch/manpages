NAME
       sensors.conf - libsensors configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       sensors.conf  describes  how  libsensors,  and  so all programs using it,
       should translate the raw readings from the kernel modules  to  real-world
       values.


SEMANTICS
       On  a  given  system, there may be one or more hardware monitoring chips.
       Each chip may have several features. For example,  the  LM78  monitors  7
       voltage  inputs,  3 fans and one temperature. Feature names are standard&#8208;
       ized. Typical feature names are in0,  in1,  in2...  for  voltage  inputs,
       fan1,  fan2,  fan3... for fans and temp1, temp2, temp3... for temperature
       inputs.

       Each feature may in turn have one or more sub-features, each representing
       an  attribute  of the feature: input value, low limit, high limit, alarm,
       etc. Sub-feature names are standardized as well. For example,  the  first
       voltage input (in0) would typically have sub-features in0_input (measured
       value), in0_min (low limit), in0_max (high limit)  and  in0_alarm  (alarm
       flag).  Which  sub-features are actually present depend on the exact chip
       type.

       The sensors.conf configuration file will let  you  configure  each  chip,
       feature and sub-feature in a way that makes sense for your system.

       The  rest  of  this  section  describes the meaning of each configuration
       statement.


   CHIP STATEMENT
       A chip statement selects for which chips all  following  compute,  label,
       ignore and set statements are meant. A chip selection remains valid until
       the next chip statement. Example:

              chip &quot;lm78-*&quot; &quot;lm79-*&quot;

       If a chip matches at least one of the chip  descriptions,  the  following
       configuration lines are examined for it, otherwise they are ignored.

       A  chip  description is built from several elements, separated by dashes.
       The first element is the chip type, the second element is the name of the
       bus,  and  the third element is the hexadecimal address of the chip. Such
       chip descriptions are printed by sensors(1) as the first line  for  every
       chip.

       The  name  of  the bus is either isa, pci, virtual, spi-* or i2c-N with N
       being a bus number as bound with a bus statement. This list isn&apos;t  neces&#8208;
       sarily  exhaustive  as  support  for  other bus types may be added in the
       future.

       You may substitute the wildcard operator * for every element.  Note  how&#8208;
       ever  that  it wouldn&apos;t make any sense to specify the address without the
       bus type, so the address part is plain omitted when the  bus  type  isn&apos;t
       specified.  Here is how you would express the following matches:


       l  l.  LM78 chip at address 0x2d on I2C bus 1  lm78-i2c-1-2d LM78 chip at
       address 0x2d on any I2C bus     lm78-i2c-*-2d LM78 chip at address  0x290
       on   the   ISA   bus    lm78-isa-0290   Any   LM78   chip   on   I2C  bus
       1    lm78-i2c-1-* Any LM78 on any I2C bus  lm78-i2c-*-* Any LM78 chip  on
       the ISA bus  lm78-isa-* Any LM78 chip  lm78-* Any chip at address 0x2d on
       I2C  bus  1    *-i2c-1-2d  Any  chip  at  address  0x290   on   the   ISA
       bus     *-isa-0290

       If  several  chip  statements match a specific chip, they are all consid&#8208;
       ered.


   LABEL STATEMENT
       A label statement describes how a  feature  should  be  called.  Features
       without a label statement are just called by their feature name. Applica&#8208;
       tions can use this to label the readings they present. Example:

              label in3 &quot;+5V&quot;

       The first argument is the feature name. The second argument is  the  fea&#8208;
       ture description.


   IGNORE STATEMENT
       An ignore statement is a hint that a specific feature should be ignored -
       probably because it returns bogus values (for example, because a  fan  or
       temperature sensor is not connected). Example:

              ignore fan1

       The  only  argument  is  the feature name. Please note that this does not
       disable anything in the actual sensor chip; it simply hides  the  feature
       in question from libsensors users.


   COMPUTE STATEMENT
       A  compute statement describes how a feature&apos;s raw value should be trans&#8208;
       lated to a real-world value, and how a real-world value should be  trans&#8208;
       lated back to a raw value again. This is most useful for voltage sensors,
       because in general sensor chips have a limited range and voltages outside
       this  range  must  be  divided (using resistors) before they can be moni&#8208;
       tored.  Example:

              compute in3 ((6.8/10)+1)*@, @/((6.8/10)+1)

       The example above expresses the fact that the voltage  input  is  divided
       using  two  resistors of values 6.8 Ohm and 10 Ohm, respectively. See the
       VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS section below for details.

       The first argument is the feature name. The second argument is an expres&#8208;
       sion  which  specifies how a raw value must be translated to a real-world
       value; `@&apos; stands here for the raw value. This is the formula which  will
       be  applied  when  reading values from the chip. The third argument is an
       expression that specifies how a real-world  value  should  be  translated
       back  to  a  raw value; `@&apos; stands here for the real-world value. This is
       the formula which will be applied when writing values to  the  chip.  The
       two formulas are obviously related, and are separated by a comma.

       A compute statement applies to all sub-features of the target feature for
       which it makes  sense.  For  example,  the  above  example  would  affect
       sub-features  in3_min  and  in3_max  (which  are  voltage values) but not
       in3_alarm (which is a boolean flag.)

       The following operators are supported in compute statements:
              + - * / ( ) ^ `
       ^x means exp(x) and `x means ln(x).

       You may use the name of sub-features in these expressions; current  read&#8208;
       ings are substituted. You should be careful though to avoid circular ref&#8208;
       erences.

       If at any moment a translation between a raw and a  real-world  value  is
       called for, but no compute statement applies, a one-on-one translation is
       used instead.


   SET STATEMENT
       A set statement is used to write a sub-feature  value  to  the  chip.  Of
       course  not  all  sub-feature  values  can be set that way, in particular
       input values and alarm flags can  not.  Valid  sub-features  are  usually
       min/max limits.  Example:

              set in3_min  5 * 0.95
              set in3_max  5 * 1.05

       The  example  above  basically configures the chip to allow a 5% deviance
       for the +5V power input.

       The first argument is the feature name. The second argument is an expres&#8208;
       sion  which determines the written value. If there is an applying compute
       statement, this value is fed to its third argument to translate it  to  a
       raw value.

       You  may use the name of sub-features in these expressions; current read&#8208;
       ings are substituted. You should be careful though to avoid circular ref&#8208;
       erences.

       Please  note that set statements are only executed by sensors(1) when you
       use the -s option. Typical graphical sensors  applications  do  not  care
       about these statements at all.


   BUS STATEMENT
       A bus statement binds the description of an I2C or SMBus adapter to a bus
       number.  This makes it possible to refer to an adapter in the  configura&#8208;
       tion  file,  independent  of the actual correspondence of bus numbers and
       actual adapters (which may change from moment to moment). Example:

              bus &quot;i2c-0&quot; &quot;SMBus PIIX4 adapter at e800&quot;

       The first argument is the bus number. It is the literal text  i2c-,  fol&#8208;
       lowed by a number. As there is a dash in this argument, it must always be
       quoted.

       The second argument is the  adapter  name,  it  must  match  exactly  the
       adapter  name  as  it  appears  in /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-*/name.  It
       should always be quoted as well as it will most certainly contain  spaces
       or dashes.

       The bus statements may be scattered randomly throughout the configuration
       file; there is no need to place the bus line before the place  where  its
       binding  is referred to. Still, as a matter of good style, we suggest you
       place all bus statements together at the top of your configuration file.

       Running sensors --bus-list will generate these lines for you.

       In the case where multiple configuration files are  used,  the  scope  of
       each  bus  statement  is  the  configuration file it was defined in. This
       makes it possible to have bus statements in all configuration files which
       will not unexpectedly interfere with each other.


   STATEMENT ORDER
       Statements  can  go  in  any order, however it is recommended to put `set
       fanX_div&apos; statements before `set fanX_min&apos; statements, in case  a  driver
       doesn&apos;t preserve the fanX_min setting when the fanX_div value is changed.
       Even if the driver does, it&apos;s still better to put the statements in  this
       order to avoid accuracy loss.


VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS
       Most  voltage  sensors in sensor chips have a range of 0 to 4.08 V.  This
       is generally sufficient for the +3.3V and CPU  supply  voltages,  so  the
       sensor chip reading is the actual voltage.

       Other  supply  voltages must be scaled with an external resistor network.
       The driver reports the value at the chip&apos;s pin (0  -  4.08  V),  and  the
       userspace  application  must convert this raw value to an actual voltage.
       The compute statements provide this facility.

       Unfortunately the resistor values vary among motherboard  types.   There&#8208;
       fore  you  have  to  figure  out the correct resistor values for your own
       motherboard.

       For positive voltages (typically +5V and +12V), two resistors  are  used,
       with the following formula:
               R1 = R2 * (Vs/Vin - 1)

       where:
               R1 and R2 are the resistor values
               Vs is the actual voltage being monitored
               Vin is the voltage at the pin

       This leads to the following compute formula:
               compute inX @*((R1/R2)+1),  @/(((R1/R2)+1)

       Real-world formula for +5V and +12V would look like:
               compute in3 @*((6.8/10)+1), @/((6.8/10)+1)
               compute in4 @*((28/10)+1),  @/((28/10)+1)

       For negative voltages (typically -5V and -12V), two resistors are used as
       well, but different boards use different strategies to bring the  voltage
       value  into the 0 - 4.08 V range. Some use an inverting amplifier, others
       use a positive reference voltage. This  leads  to  different  computation
       formulas.  Note  that  most  users won&apos;t have to care because most modern
       motherboards make little use of -12V and no use of -5V  so  they  do  not
       bother monitoring these voltage inputs.

       Real-world examples for the inverting amplifier case:
               compute in5 -@*(240/60), -@/(240/60)
               compute in6 -@*(100/60), -@/(100/60)

       Real-world examples for the positive voltage reference case:
               compute     in5     @*(1+232/56)    -    4.096*232/56,    (@    +
       4.096*232/56)/(1+232/56)
               compute    in6    @*(1+120/56)    -    4.096*120/56,     (@     +
       4.096*120/56)/(1+120/56)

       Many  recent  monitoring chips have a 0 - 2.04 V range, so scaling resis&#8208;
       tors are even more needed, and resistor values are different.

       There are also a few chips out there which have internal  scaling  resis&#8208;
       tors, meaning that their value is known and doesn&apos;t change from one moth&#8208;
       erboard to the next. For these chips,  the  driver  usually  handles  the
       scaling  so  it  is transparent to the user and no compute statements are
       needed.


TEMPERATURE CONFIGURATION
       On top of the usual features, temperatures can have two specific sub-fea&#8208;
       tures:   temperature  sensor  type  (tempX_type)  and  hysteresis  values
       (tempX_max_hyst and tempX_crit_hyst).


   THERMAL SENSOR TYPES
       Available thermal sensor types:

       r l.  1    PII/Celeron  Diode  2    3904  transistor  3    thermal  diode
       4    thermistor 5    AMD AMDSI 6    Intel PECI

       For example, to set temp1 to thermistor type, use:

              set temp1_type 4

       Only  certain  chips  support  thermal sensor type change, and even these
       usually only support some of the types above. Please refer  to  the  spe&#8208;
       cific  driver documentation to find out which types are supported by your
       chip.

       In theory, the BIOS should have configured the sensor types correctly, so
       you shouldn&apos;t have to touch them, but sometimes it isn&apos;t the case.


   THERMAL HYSTERESIS MECHANISM
       Many  monitoring  chips  do  not handle the high and critical temperature
       limits as simple limits. Instead, they have two values  for  each  limit,
       one  which  triggers  an alarm when the temperature rises and another one
       which clears the alarm when the temperature falls. The  latter  is  typi&#8208;
       cally a few degrees below the former. This mechanism is known as hystere&#8208;
       sis.

       The reason for implementing things that  way  is  that  high  temperature
       alarms  typically  trigger  an action to attempt to cool the system down,
       either by scaling down the CPU frequency, or by kicking in an extra  fan.
       This  should  normally  let  the temperature fall in a timely manner.  If
       this was clearing the alarm immediately, then the system would be back to
       its  original state where the temperature rises and the alarm would imme&#8208;
       diately trigger again, causing an undesirable tight fan on, fan off loop.
       The  hysteresis  mechanism  ensures that the system is really cool before
       the fan stops, so that it will not have to kick in again immediately.

       So, in addition to tempX_max, many chips have a  tempX_max_hyst  sub-fea&#8208;
       ture. Likewise, tempX_crit often comes with tempX_crit_hyst.  Example:

              set temp1_max      60
              set temp1_max_hyst 56

       The  hysteresis  mechanism can be disabled by giving both limits the same
       value.


BEEPS
       Some chips support alarms with beep warnings. When an alarm is  triggered
       you  can  be warned by a beeping signal through your computer speaker. On
       top of per-feature beep flags, there is usually  a  master  beep  control
       switch to enable or disable beeping globally. Enable beeping using:

              set beep_enable 1

       or disable it using:

              set beep_enable 0


WHICH STATEMENT APPLIES
       If  more than one statement of the same kind applies at a certain moment,
       the last one in the configuration file is used. So  usually,  you  should
       put  more  general  chip  statements at the top, so you can overrule them
       below.


SYNTAX
       Comments are introduced by hash marks. A comment continues to the end  of
       the  line.  Empty lines, and lines containing only whitespace or comments
       are ignored.  Other lines have one of the  below  forms.  There  must  be
       whitespace between each element, but the amount of whitespace is unimpor&#8208;
       tant. A line may be continued on the next line by ending it with a  back&#8208;
       slash; this does not work within a comment, NAME or NUMBER.

              bus NAME NAME NAME
              chip NAME-LIST
              label NAME NAME
              compute NAME EXPR , EXPR
              ignore NAME
              set NAME EXPR

       A  NAME is a string. If it only contains letters, digits and underscores,
       it does not have to be quoted; in all other cases, you  must  use  double
       quotes  around  it.   Within  quotes, you can use the normal escape-codes
       from C.

       A NAME-LIST is one or more NAME items behind  each  other,  separated  by
       whitespace.

       A EXPR is of one of the below forms:

              NUMBER
              NAME
              @
              EXPR + EXPR
              EXPR - EXPR
              EXPR * EXPR
              EXPR / EXPR
              - EXPR
              ^ EXPR
              ` EXPR
              ( EXPR )

       A  NUMBER  is a floating-point number. `10&apos;, `10.4&apos; and `.4&apos; are examples
       of valid floating-point numbers; `10.&apos; or `10E4&apos; are not valid.


FILES
       /etc/sensors3.conf
       /etc/sensors.conf
              The  system-wide  libsensors(3)  configuration   file.   /etc/sen&#8208;
              sors3.conf  is  tried  first,  and  if it doesn&apos;t exist, /etc/sen&#8208;
              sors.conf is used instead.

       /etc/sensors.d
              A directory where you can put additional libsensors  configuration
              files.   Files found in this directory will be processed in alpha&#8208;
              betical order after the default  configuration  file.  Files  with
              names that start with a dot are ignored.
