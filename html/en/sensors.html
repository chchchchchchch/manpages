sensors(1)                     Linux User&apos;s Manual                    sensors(1)



NAME
       sensors - print sensors information

SYNOPSIS
       sensors [ options ] [ chips ]
       sensors -s [ chips ]
       sensors --bus-list


DESCRIPTION
       sensors is used to show the current readings of all sensor chips.
       sensors  -s  is  used to set all limits as specified in the configuration
       file.
       sensors --bus-list is used to generate bus statements  suitable  for  the
       configuration file.


OPTIONS
       -c config-file
              Specify a configuration file. If no file is specified, the libsen&#8208;
              sors default configuration file is used.  Use  `-c  /dev/null&apos;  to
              temporarily disable this default configuration file.

       -h     Print a help text and exit.

       -s     Evaluate  all `set&apos; statements in the configuration file and exit.
              You must be `root&apos; to do this. If this parameter is not specified,
              no `set&apos; statement is evaluated.

       -A     Do not show the adapter for each chip.

       -u     Raw output. This mode is only meant for debugging.

       -v     Print the program version and exit.

       -f     Print the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.

       --bus-list
              Generate  bus  statements suitable for using in sensors.conf. Such
              bus statements are only needed if you have several  chips  sharing
              the  same address on different buses of the same type. As bus num&#8208;
              bers are usually not guaranteed to be stable over  reboots,  these
              statements  let you refer to each bus by its name rather than num&#8208;
              bers.

FILES
       /etc/sensors3.conf
       /etc/sensors.conf
              The system wide configuration file. See sensors.conf(5)  for  fur&#8208;
              ther details.
