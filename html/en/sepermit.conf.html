SEPERMIT.CONF(5)                Linux-PAM Manual                SEPERMIT.CONF(5)



NAME
       sepermit.conf - configuration file for the pam_sepermit module

DESCRIPTION
       The lines of the configuration file have the following syntax:

       &lt;user&gt;[:&lt;option&gt;:&lt;option&gt;...]

       The user can be specified in the following manner:

       &#183;   a username

       &#183;   a groupname, with @group syntax. This should not be confused with
           netgroups.

       &#183;   a SELinux user name with %seuser syntax.

       The recognized options are:

       exclusive
           Only single login session will be allowed for the user and the user&apos;s
           processes will be killed on logout.

       ignore
           The module will never return PAM_SUCCESS status for the user. It will
           return PAM_IGNORE if SELinux is in the enforcing mode, and
           PAM_AUTH_ERR otherwise. It is useful if you want to support
           passwordless guest users and other confined users with passwords
           simultaneously.

       The lines which start with # character are comments and are ignored.

EXAMPLES
       These are some example lines which might be specified in
       /etc/security/sepermit.conf.

           %guest_u:exclusive
           %staff_u:ignore
           %user_u:ignore
