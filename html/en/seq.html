NAME
       seq - print a sequence of numbers

SYNOPSIS
       seq [OPTION]... LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST

DESCRIPTION
       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an omitted
       INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when LAST is  smaller  than  FIRST.   FIRST,
       INCREMENT,  and LAST are interpreted as floating point values.  INCREMENT
       is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is  usu&#8208;
       ally negative if FIRST is greater than LAST.  FORMAT must be suitable for
       printing one argument of type `double&apos;; it defaults to %.PRECf if  FIRST,
       INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed point decimal numbers with maximum pre&#8208;
       cision PREC, and to %g otherwise.
