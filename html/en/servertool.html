servertool(1)                                                      servertool(1)



Name
       servertool - The Java(TM) IDL Server Tool

       servertool  provides a command-line interface for application programmers
       to register, unregister, startup, and shutdown a persistent server.

SYNOPSIS
       servertool -ORBInitialPort nameserverport options [ commands ]


       If you did not enter a command when starting servertool, the command-line
       tool  displays  with a servertool &gt; prompt. Enter commands at the server&#8208;
       tool &gt; prompt.

       If you enter a command when starting servertool, the Java IDL Server Tool
       starts, runs the command, and exits.

       The  -ORBInitialPort  nameserverport  option  is  required. The value for
       nameserverport must specify the port on which orbd is running and listen&#8208;
       ing  for  incoming requests. When using Solaris software, you must become
       root to start a process on a port under 1024. For this reason, we  recom&#8208;
       mend  that  you  use  a port number greater than or equal to 1024 for the
       nameserverport.

DESCRIPTION
       The servertool provides the command-line interface  for  the  application
       programmers  to  register, unregister, startup, and shutdown a persistent
       server. Other commands are provided to obtain various statistical  infor&#8208;
       mation about the server.

OPTIONS
          -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost
             Specifies  the host machine on which the name server is running and
             listening for incoming requests.  The  nameserverhost  defaults  to
             localhost  if  this option is not specified. If orbd and servertool
             are running on different machines, you must specify the name or  IP
             address of the host on which orbd is running.

          -Joption
             Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one of the
             options described on the reference page for java(1).  For  example,
             -J-Xms48m  sets  the startup memory to 48 megabytes. It is a common
             convention for  -J  to  pass  options  to  the  underlying  virtual
             machine.


COMMANDS
          register -server &lt;server class name&gt;  -classpath &lt;classpath to server&gt;
          [ -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;           -args &lt;args to server&gt;
          -vmargs &lt;flags to be passed to Java VM&gt;  ]
             Register  a  new  persistent  server with the Object Request Broker
             Daemon (ORBD). If the server is not already registered, it is  reg&#8208;
             istered  and activated. This command causes an install method to be
             invoked in the main class of the server identified by  the  -server
             option.   The   install   method   must   be   public  static  void
             install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The  install  method  is  optional  and
             enables  the  developer  to  provide  their own server installation
             behavior (for example, creating database schema).

          unregister     -serverid &lt;server id &gt; |     -applicationName &lt;applica&#8208;
          tion name&gt;
             Unregister  a server from the ORBD by using either its server id or
             its application name. This command causes an uninstall method to be
             invoked  in  the main class of the server identified by the -server
             option. The uninstall method  must  be  public  static  void  unin&#8208;
             stall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB).  The  uninstall  method  is  optional and
             enables the developer to provide their own server uninstall  behav&#8208;
             ior (for example, undoing the behavior of the install method).

          getserverid -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
             Return the server id that corresponds with an application.

          list
             List  information  about all persistent servers registered with the
             ORBD.

          listappnames
             List the application names for  all  servers  currently  registered
             with the ORBD.

          listactive
             List  information  about  all  persistent  servers  that  have been
             launched by the ORBD and are currently running.

          locate  -serverid &lt;server id &gt; |   -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
          [-endpointType &lt;endpointType&gt; ]
             Locate  the  endpoints (ports) of a specific type for all ORBs cre&#8208;
             ated by a registered server. If a server is not already running, it
             is  activated.  If  an  endpoint  type  is  not specified, then the
             plain/non-protected endpoint associated with each ORB in  a  server
             is returned.

          locateperorb    -serverid &lt;server id &gt; |    -applicationName &lt;applica&#8208;
          tion name&gt; [-orbid &lt;ORB name&gt; ]
             Locate all the endpoints (ports) registered by a  specific  ORB  of
             registered  server.  If a server is not already running, then it is
             activated. If an orbid is not specified, the default value of &quot;&quot; is
             assigned  to  the  orbid.  If any ORBs are created with an orbid of
             empty string, all ports registered by it are returned.

          orblist -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
             Lists the ORBId of the ORBs defined on a server. An  ORBId  is  the
             string name for the ORB created by the server. If the server is not
             already running, it is activated.

          shutdown -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
             Shutdown an active server that is registered with ORBD. During exe&#8208;
             cution  of this command, the shutdown() method defined in the class
             specified by either the -serverid or -applicationName parameter  is
             also invoked to shutdown the server process appropriately.

          startup -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
             Startup  or  activate a server that is registered with ORBD. If the
             server is not running, this command launches  the  server.  If  the
             server  is  already  running,  an  error message is returned to the
             user.

          help
             List all the commands available to the server  through  the  server
             tool.

          quit
             Exit the server tool.
