NAME
       service - run a System V init script


SYNOPSIS
       service SCRIPT COMMAND [OPTIONS]

       service --status-all

       service --help | -h | --version


DESCRIPTION
       service  runs  a System V init script in as predictable an environment as
       possible, removing most environment variables and with the current  work&#8208;
       ing directory set to /.

       The  SCRIPT  parameter  specifies  a  System  V  init  script, located in
       /etc/init.d/SCRIPT.  The  supported  values  of  COMMAND  depend  on  the
       invoked  script.   service  passes COMMAND and OPTIONS to the init script
       unmodified.  All scripts should support at least the start and stop  com&#8208;
       mands.   As  a  special case, if COMMAND is --full-restart, the script is
       run twice, first with the stop command, then with the start command.

       service --status-all runs all init scripts, in alphabetical  order,  with
       the status command.


EXIT CODES
       service calls the init script and returns the status returned by it.


FILES
       /etc/init.d
              The directory containing System V init scripts.


ENVIRONMENT
       LANG, TERM
              The only environment variables passed to the init scripts.


SEE ALSO
       /etc/init.d/skeleton,
       update-rc.d(8),
       init(8),
       invoke-rc.d(8).
