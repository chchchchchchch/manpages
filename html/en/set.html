NAME
       libcaca character set conversions -

   Functions
       __extern uint32_t caca_utf8_to_utf32 (char const *, size_t *)
           Convert a UTF-8 character to UTF-32.
       __extern size_t caca_utf32_to_utf8 (char *, uint32_t)
           Convert a UTF-32 character to UTF-8.
       __extern uint8_t caca_utf32_to_cp437 (uint32_t)
           Convert a UTF-32 character to CP437.
       __extern uint32_t caca_cp437_to_utf32 (uint8_t)
           Convert a CP437 character to UTF-32.
       __extern char caca_utf32_to_ascii (uint32_t)
           Convert a UTF-32 character to ASCII.
       __extern int caca_utf32_is_fullwidth (uint32_t)
           Tell whether a UTF-32 character is fullwidth.

Detailed Description
       These functions perform conversions between usual character sets.

Function Documentation
   __extern uint32_t caca_utf8_to_utf32 (char const *s, size_t *bytes) Convert a
       UTF-8 character read from a string and return its value in the UTF-32
       character set. If the second argument is not null, the total number of
       read bytes is written in it.
       If a null byte was reached before the expected end of the UTF-8 sequence,
       this function returns zero and the number of read bytes is set to zero.

       This function never fails, but its behaviour with illegal UTF-8 sequences
       is undefined.

       Parameters:
           s A string containing the UTF-8 character.
           bytes A pointer to a size_t to store the number of bytes in the
           character, or NULL.

       Returns:
           The corresponding UTF-32 character, or zero if the character is
           incomplete.

   __extern size_t caca_utf32_to_utf8 (char *buf, uint32_tch) Convert a UTF-32
       character read from a string and write its value in the UTF-8 character
       set into the given buffer.
       This function never fails, but its behaviour with illegal UTF-32
       characters is undefined.

       Parameters:
           buf A pointer to a character buffer where the UTF-8 sequence will be
           written.
           ch The UTF-32 character.

       Returns:
           The number of bytes written.

   __extern uint8_t caca_utf32_to_cp437 (uint32_tch) Convert a UTF-32 character
       read from a string and return its value in the CP437 character set, or
       &apos;?&apos; if the character has no equivalent.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           ch The UTF-32 character.

       Returns:
           The corresponding CP437 character, or &apos;?&apos; if not representable.

   __extern uint32_t caca_cp437_to_utf32 (uint8_tch) Convert a CP437 character
       read from a string and return its value in the UTF-32 character set, or
       zero if the character is a CP437 control character.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           ch The CP437 character.

       Returns:
           The corresponding UTF-32 character, or zero if not representable.

   __extern char caca_utf32_to_ascii (uint32_tch) Convert a UTF-32 character
       into an ASCII character. When no equivalent exists, a graphically close
       equivalent is sought.
       This function never fails, but its behaviour with illegal UTF-32
       characters is undefined.

       Parameters:
           ch The UTF-32 character.

       Returns:
           The corresponding ASCII character, or a graphically close equivalent
           if found, or &apos;?&apos; if not representable.

   __extern int caca_utf32_is_fullwidth (uint32_tch) Check whether the given
       UTF-32 character should be printed at twice the normal width (fullwidth
       characters). If the character is unknown or if its status cannot be
       decided, it is treated as a standard-width character.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           ch The UTF-32 character.

       Returns:
           1 if the character is fullwidth, 0 otherwise.
