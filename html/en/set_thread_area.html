SET_THREAD_AREA(2)          Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual         SET_THREAD_AREA(2)



NAME
       set_thread_area - set a thread local storage (TLS) area

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;asm/ldt.h&gt;

       int set_thread_area(struct user_desc *u_info);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       set_thread_area()  sets  an  entry  in  the current thread&apos;s thread-local
       storage (TLS) array.  The TLS array entry set by set_thread_area() corre&#8208;
       sponds  to  the  value of u_info-&gt;entry_number passed in by the user.  If
       this value is in bounds,  set_thread_area()  copies  the  TLS  descriptor
       pointed to by u_info into the thread&apos;s TLS array.

       When  set_thread_area()  is  passed an entry_number of -1, it uses a free
       TLS entry.  If set_thread_area() finds a free TLS  entry,  the  value  of
       u_info-&gt;entry_number is set upon return to show which entry was changed.

RETURN VALUE
       set_thread_area() returns 0 on success, and -1 on failure, with errno set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL u_info-&gt;entry_number is out of bounds.

       EFAULT u_info is an invalid pointer.

       ESRCH  A free TLS entry could not be located.

VERSIONS
       A version of set_thread_area() first appeared in Linux 2.5.29.

CONFORMING TO
       set_thread_area() is Linux-specific and should not be  used  in  programs
       that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call, since it is gener&#8208;
       ally intended only for use by threading libraries.  In the unlikely event
       that you want to call it directly, use syscall(2).
