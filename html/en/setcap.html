SETCAP(8)                                                              SETCAP(8)



NAME
       setcap - set file capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       setcap [-q] [-v] (capabilities|-|-r) filename [ ... capabilitiesN fileN ]

DESCRIPTION
       In  the absence of the -v (verify) option setcap sets the capabilities of
       each specified filename to the capabilities specified.  The -v option  is
       used  to  verify that the specified capabilities are currently associated
       with the file.

       The capabilities are specified in the form described in cap_from_text(3).

       The special capability string, &apos;-&apos;, can be used to indicate that capabil&#8208;
       ities are read from the standard input. In such cases, the capability set
       is terminated with a blank line.

       The special capability string, &apos;-r&apos;, is used to remove a  capability  set
       from a file.

       The -q flag is used to make the program less verbose in its output.

EXIT CODE
       The  setcap  program will exit with a 0 exit code if successful. On fail&#8208;
       ure, the exit code is 1.
