SETEUID(2)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 SETEUID(2)



NAME
       seteuid, setegid - set effective user or group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int seteuid(uid_t euid);
       int setegid(gid_t egid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       seteuid(), setegid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

DESCRIPTION
       seteuid()  sets  the  effective user ID of the calling process.  Unprivi&#8208;
       leged user processes may only set the effective user ID to the real  user
       ID, the effective user ID or the saved set-user-ID.

       Precisely the same holds for setegid() with &quot;group&quot; instead of &quot;user&quot;.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The calling process is not privileged (Linux: does  not  have  the
              CAP_SETUID  capability in the case of seteuid(), or the CAP_SETGID
              capability in the case of setegid()) and euid (respectively, egid)
              is not the real user (group) ID, the effective user (group) ID, or
              the saved set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID).

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Setting the effective user (group) ID to  the  saved  set-user-ID  (saved
       set-group-ID)  is  possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).  On an arbitrary
       system one should check _POSIX_SAVED_IDS.

       Under  libc4,  libc5  and  glibc  2.0  seteuid(euid)  is  equivalent   to
       setreuid(-1,  euid)  and  hence  may change the saved set-user-ID.  Under
       glibc 2.1 and later it is equivalent to setresuid(-1, euid, -1) and hence
       does  not change the saved set-user-ID.  Analogous remarks hold for sete&#8208;
       gid(), with  the  difference  that  the  change  in  implementation  from
       setregid(-1,  egid)  to  setresgid(-1, egid, -1) occurred in glibc 2.2 or
       2.3 (dependeing on the hardware architecture).

       According to POSIX.1, seteuid() (setegid()) need not permit  euid  (egid)
       to  be  the same value as the current effective user (group) ID, and some
       implementations do not permit this.
