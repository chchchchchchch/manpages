SETLOCALE(3)                Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual               SETLOCALE(3)



NAME
       setlocale - set the current locale

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;locale.h&gt;

       char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);

DESCRIPTION
       The  setlocale()  function  is used to set or query the program&apos;s current
       locale.

       If locale is not NULL, the program&apos;s current locale is modified according
       to  the  arguments.   The argument category determines which parts of the
       program&apos;s current locale should be modified.

       LC_ALL for all of the locale.

       LC_COLLATE
              for regular expression matching  (it  determines  the  meaning  of
              range expressions and equivalence classes) and string collation.

       LC_CTYPE
              for regular expression matching, character classification, conver&#8208;
              sion, case-sensitive comparison, and wide character functions.

       LC_MESSAGES
              for localizable natural-language messages.

       LC_MONETARY
              for monetary formatting.

       LC_NUMERIC
              for number formatting (such as the decimal point and the thousands
              separator).

       LC_TIME
              for time and date formatting.

       The  argument  locale  is  a pointer to a character string containing the
       required setting of category.  Such a string is either a well-known  con&#8208;
       stant  like  &quot;C&quot;  or  &quot;da_DK&quot;  (see  below), or an opaque string that was
       returned by another call of setlocale().

       If locale is &quot;&quot;, each part of the locale that should be modified  is  set
       according  to the environment variables.  The details are implementation-
       dependent.  For glibc, first (regardless of  category),  the  environment
       variable LC_ALL is inspected, next the environment variable with the same
       name as the category  (LC_COLLATE,  LC_CTYPE,  LC_MESSAGES,  LC_MONETARY,
       LC_NUMERIC,  LC_TIME)  and  finally  the  environment variable LANG.  The
       first existing environment variable is used.  If its value is not a valid
       locale  specification,  the  locale is unchanged, and setlocale() returns
       NULL.

       The locale &quot;C&quot; or &quot;POSIX&quot; is a portable locale; its LC_CTYPE part  corre&#8208;
       sponds to the 7-bit ASCII character set.

       A  locale  name  is  typically  of  the  form language[_territory][.code&#8208;
       set][@modifier], where language is an ISO 639 language code, territory is
       an  ISO  3166  country  code,  and codeset is a character set or encoding
       identifier like ISO-8859-1  or  UTF-8.   For  a  list  of  all  supported
       locales, try &quot;locale -a&quot;, cf. locale(1).

       If locale is NULL, the current locale is only queried, not modified.

       On  startup  of  the main program, the portable &quot;C&quot; locale is selected as
       default.  A program may be made portable to all locales by calling:

           setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;);

       after program initialization, by using the values returned from a locale&#8208;
       conv(3) call for locale-dependent information, by using the multibyte and
       wide character functions for text processing if MB_CUR_MAX &gt;  1,  and  by
       using   strcoll(3),  wcscoll(3)  or  strxfrm(3),  wcsxfrm(3)  to  compare
       strings.

RETURN VALUE
       A successful call to setlocale() returns an  opaque  string  that  corre&#8208;
       sponds  to  the locale set.  This string may be allocated in static stor&#8208;
       age.  The string returned is such that a subsequent call with that string
       and  its  associated  category  will  restore  that part of the process&apos;s
       locale.  The return value is NULL if the request cannot be honored.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Linux (that is, glibc) supports the portable locales &quot;C&quot; and &quot;POSIX&quot;.  In
       the  good  old  days  there  used  to be support for the European Latin-1
       &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; locale (e.g., in libc-4.5.21 and libc-4.6.27), and the  Rus&#8208;
       sian &quot;KOI-8&quot; (more precisely, &quot;koi-8r&quot;) locale (e.g., in libc-4.6.27), so
       that having an environment variable LC_CTYPE=ISO-8859-1 sufficed to  make
       isprint(3)  return  the  right  answer.   These days non-English speaking
       Europeans have to work a bit  harder,  and  must  install  actual  locale
       files.
