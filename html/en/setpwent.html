GETPWENT(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                GETPWENT(3)



NAME
       getpwent, setpwent, endpwent - get password file entry

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;

       struct passwd *getpwent(void);

       void setpwent(void);

       void endpwent(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpwent(), setpwent(), endpwent():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The getpwent() function returns a pointer to a structure  containing  the
       broken-out fields of a record from the password database (e.g., the local
       password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP).  The first time getpwent()  is
       called,  it  returns  the  first entry; thereafter, it returns successive
       entries.

       The setpwent() function rewinds to the beginning of  the  password  data&#8208;
       base.

       The  endpwent() function is used to close the password database after all
       processing has been performed.

       The passwd structure is defined in &lt;pwd.h&gt; as follows:

           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };

       When shadow(5) passwords are enabled (which is default on many  GNU/Linux
       installations)  the  content of pw_passwd is usually not very useful.  In
       such a case most passwords are stored in a separate file.

       The variable pw_shell may be empty, in which case the system will execute
       the default shell (/bin/sh) for the user.

       For more information about the fields of this structure, see passwd(5).

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpwent() function returns a pointer to a passwd structure, or NULL
       if there are no more entries or an error occured.  If  an  error  occurs,
       errno  is set appropriately.  If one wants to check errno after the call,
       it should be set to zero before the call.

       The return value may point to a static area, and may  be  overwritten  by
       subsequent  calls  to  getpwent(),  getpwnam(3), or getpwuid(3).  (Do not
       pass the returned pointer to free(3).)

ERRORS
       EINTR  A signal was caught.

       EIO    I/O error.

       EMFILE The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was  open  already  in  the
              calling process.

       ENFILE The maximum number of files was open already in the system.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd structure.

       ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
              local password database file

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4,  4.3BSD,  POSIX.1-2001.   The  pw_gecos  field  is not specified in
       POSIX, but is present on most implementations.
