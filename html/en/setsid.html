SETSID(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  SETSID(2)



NAME
       setsid - creates a session and sets the process group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t setsid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       setsid()  creates  a  new session if the calling process is not a process
       group leader.  The calling process is the leader of the new session,  the
       process  group  leader  of  the new process group, and has no controlling
       tty.  The process group ID and session ID of the calling process are  set
       to  the PID of the calling process.  The calling process will be the only
       process in this new process group and in this new session.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the (new) session ID of the calling process is returned.   On
       error, (pid_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The  process group ID of any process equals the PID of the calling
              process.  Thus, in  particular,  setsid()  fails  if  the  calling
              process is already a process group leader.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       A  child  created via fork(2) inherits its parent&apos;s session ID.  The ses&#8208;
       sion ID is preserved across an execve(2).

       A process group leader is a process with process group ID  equal  to  its
       PID.   In  order  to  be  sure  that  setsid()  will succeed, fork(2) and
       _exit(2), and have the child do setsid().
