SETTERM(1)                        User Commands                       SETTERM(1)



NAME
       setterm - set terminal attributes

SYNOPSIS
       setterm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       setterm writes to standard output a character string that will invoke the
       specified terminal capabilities.  Where possible terminfo is consulted to
       find  the  string to use.  Some options however (marked &quot;virtual consoles
       only&quot; below) do not correspond to  a  terminfo(5)  capability.   In  this
       case,  if  the  terminal type is &quot;con&quot; or &quot;linux&quot; the string that invokes
       the specified capabilities on the PC Minix virtual console driver is out&#8208;
       put.  Options that are not implemented by the terminal are ignored.

OPTIONS
       For boolean options (on or off), the default is on.

       For  conciseness,  an  8-color  below is black, red, green, yellow, blue,
       magenta, cyan, or white.

       A 16-color is an 8-color, grey, or bright followed by red, green, yellow,
       blue, magenta, cyan, or white.

       The  various  color options may be set independently, at least at virtual
       consoles, though the results of  setting  multiple  modes  (for  example,
       -underline and -half-bright) are hardware-dependent.

       -term terminal_name
              Overrides the TERM environment variable.

       -reset Displays  the  terminal  reset  string, which typically resets the
              terminal to its power on state.

       -initialize
              Displays the terminal initialization string, which typically  sets
              the  terminal&apos;s  rendering  options,  and  other attributes to the
              default values.

       -cursor [on|off]
              Turns the terminal&apos;s cursor on or off.

       -repeat [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Turns keyboard repeat on or off.

       -appcursorkeys [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets Cursor Key Application Mode on or off. When on, ESC O A,  ESC
              O  B,  etc.   will be sent for the cursor keys instead of ESC [ A,
              ESC [ B, etc.  See the &quot;vi and Cursor-Keys&quot; section of  the  Text-
              Terminal-HOWTO for how this can cause problems for vi users.

       -linewrap [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Turns automatic line-wrapping on or off.

       -default
              Sets the terminal&apos;s rendering options to the default values.

       -foreground 8-color|default (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the foreground text color.

       -background 8-color|default (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the background text color.
&#12;       -ulcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the color for underlined characters.

       -hbcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the color for half-bright characters.

       -inversescreen [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Inverts the screen colors.  Foreground and background are swapped,
              as are underline and half-brightness.

       -bold [on|off]
              Turns bold (extra bright) mode on or off.   Except  at  a  virtual
              console,  -bold  off  turns off all attributes (bold, half-bright&#8208;
              ness, blink, reverse).

       -half-bright [on|off]
              Turns dim (half-brightness) mode on or off (see -hbcolor).  Except
              at  a  virtual  console, -half-bright off turns off all attributes
              (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       -blink [on|off]
              Turns blink mode on or off.  Except at a virtual  console,  -blink
              off  turns  off  all  attributes  (bold,  half-brightness,  blink,
              reverse).

       -reverse [on|off]
              Turns reverse video mode on or off.  Except at a virtual  console,
              -reverse  off  turns  off  all  attributes (bold, half-brightness,
              blink, reverse).

       -underline [on|off]
              Turns underline mode on or off (see -ulcolor).

       -store (virtual consoles only)
              Stores the terminal&apos;s current rendering  options  (foreground  and
              background colors) as the values to be used at reset-to-default.

       -clear [all]
              Clears the screen and &quot;homes&quot; the cursor, as clear(1).

       -clear rest
              Clears from the current cursor position to the end of the screen.

       -tabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets  tab  stops  at the given horizontal cursor positions, in the
              range 1-160.  Without arguments, shows the current tab  stop  set&#8208;
              tings.

       -clrtabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only)
              Clears  tab  stops  from the given horizontal cursor positions, in
              the range 1-160.  Without arguments, clears all tab stops.

       -regtabs [1-160] (virtual consoles only)
              Clears all tab stops, then sets a regular tab stop  pattern,  with
              one tab every specified number of positions.  Without an argument,
              defaults to 8.

       -blank [0-60|force|poke] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the interval of  inactivity,  in  minutes,  after  which  the
              screen  will  be  automatically  blanked (using APM if available).
              Without an argument, gets the blank status (returns which  vt  was
              blanked or zero for unblanked vt).

              The force option keeps screen blank even if a key is pressed.

              The poke option unblank the screen.
&#12;       -dump [1-NR_CONS]
              Writes  a  snapshot of the given virtual console (with attributes)
              to the file specified in the -file option,  overwriting  its  con&#8208;
              tents; the default is screen.dump.  Without an argument, dumps the
              current virtual console.  Overrides -append.

       -append [1-NR_CONS]
              Like -dump, but appends to the snapshot file instead of  overwrit&#8208;
              ing it.  Only works if no -dump options are given.

       -file dumpfilename
              Sets  the  snapshot  file name for any -dump or -append options on
              the same command line.  If this option is not present, the default
              is screen.dump in the current directory.  A path name that exceeds
              system maximum will be truncated, see PATH_MAX from linux/limits.h
              for the value.

       -msg [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Enables or disables the sending of kernel printk() messages to the
              console.

       -msglevel 1-8 (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the console logging level for kernel printk() messages.   All
              messages  strictly  more important than this will be printed, so a
              logging level of 0 has the same effect as -msg on  and  a  logging
              level of 8 will print all kernel messages.  klogd(8) may be a more
              convenient interface to the logging of kernel messages.

       -powersave on|vsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA vsync suspend mode.

       -powersave hsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA hsync suspend mode.

       -powersave powerdown
              Puts the monitor into VESA powerdown mode.

       -powersave [off]
              Turns off monitor VESA powersaving features.

       -powerdown [0-60]
              Sets the VESA powerdown interval in minutes.  Without an argument,
              defaults  to  0 (disable powerdown).  If the console is blanked or
              the monitor is in suspend mode, then  the  monitor  will  go  into
              vsync  suspend  mode  or  powerdown  mode  respectively after this
              period of time has elapsed.

       -blength [0-2000]
              Sets the bell duration  in  milliseconds.   Without  an  argument,
              defaults to 0.

       -bfreq [freqnumber]
              Sets  the  bell frequency in Hz.  Without an argument, defaults to
              0.

       -version
              Output version information and exit.

       -help  Output help screen and exit.
