SGI2TIFF(1)                                                          SGI2TIFF(1)



NAME
       sgi2tiff - create a TIFF file from an SGI image file

SYNOPSIS
       sgi2tiff [ options ] input.rgb output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       sgi2tiff  converts  a  file in the SGI image format to TIFF.  By default,
       the TIFF image is created  with  data  samples  packed  (PlanarConfigura&#8208;
       tion=1),  compressed  with  the  Lempel-Ziv  &amp;  Welch algorithm (Compres&#8208;
       sion=5), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These  character&#8208;
       istics can overridden, or explicitly specified with the options described
       below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when writing  image  data:  -c
              none  for no compression, -c packbits for the PackBits compression
              algorithm), -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG  compression  algorithm,
              -c  zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, and -c lzw for Lem&#8208;
              pel-Ziv &amp; Welch (the default).

       -p     Explicitly select the planar configuration used in organizing data
              samples in the output image: -p contig for samples packed contigu&#8208;
              ously, and -p separate for samples stored separately.  By  default
              samples are packed.

       -r     Write  data  with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
              the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip is approx&#8208;
              imately 8 kilobytes.

BUGS
       Does not record colormap information.
