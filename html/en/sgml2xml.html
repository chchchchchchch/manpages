SGML2XML(1)                                                          SGML2XML(1)



NAME
       sgml2xml - convert SGML to XML

       An  SGML  System Conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 &#8212; Standard
       Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       sgml2xml [ -Cehilprvx ]  [ -bencoding ]  [ -ccatalog  ]   [  -Ddir  ]   [
       -ffile ]  [ -iname ]  [ -wwarning ]  [ -xxml-output-option ]  sysid...

DESCRIPTION
       sgml2xml  converts  SGML  to XML.  sgml2xml parses and validates the SGML
       document contained in sysid... and writes an equivalent XML  document  to
       the  standard output. sgml2xml will warn about SGML constructs which have
       no XML equivalent.

OPTIONS
       -bencoding
              Use encoding for output.  The default is UTF-8. See nsgmls(1)  for
              the possible encoding types.

       -ccatalog
              Use the catalog entry file file.

       -C     The  filename...  arguments  specify catalog files rather than the
              document entity. The document entity is  specified  by  the  first
              DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.

       -Ddirectory
              Search directory for files specified in system identifiers. Multi&#8208;
              ple -D options are allowed. See  nsgmls(1)  for  more  information
              about this option.

       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.

       -ffile Redirect  errors  to file.  This is useful only for shells that do
              not support redirection of stderr.

       -iname Pretend that &lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;INCLUDE&quot;&gt; occurs at the start of the
              document  type  declaration  subset  in  the SGML document entity.
              Since repeated definitions of an entity are ignored, this  defini&#8208;
              tion  will  take  precedence  over  any  other definitions of this
              entity in the document type declaration. Multiple -i  options  are
              allowed.  If  the  SGML  declaration  replaces  the  reserved name
              INCLUDE then the new reserved name will be the replacement text of
              the  entity.  Typically the document type declaration will contain
              &lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;IGNORE&quot;&gt; and will use %name; in the  status  key&#8208;
              word  specification  of a marked section declaration. In this case
              the effect of the option will be to cause the marked  section  not
              to be ignored.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wtype Control  warnings and errors according to type.  See nsgmls(1) for
              the allowed values of type.

       -xxml-output-option
              Control the  XML  output,  according  to  the  value  of  xml_out&#8208;
              put_option as follows:

              no-nl-in-tag
                     Don&apos;t use newlines inside start-tags. Usually sgml2xml uses
                     newlines inside start-tags so as to reduce the  probability
                     of excessively long lines.

              id     Output attribute declarations for ID attributes.

              notation
                     Output declarations for notations.

              ndata  Output   declarations   for  external  data  entities.  XML
                     requires these to be NDATA. sgml2xml will warn about  CDATA
                     and  SDATA  external data entities and output them as NDATA
                     entities.

              cdata  Use XML CDATA sections for CDATA marked  sections  and  for
                     elements with a declared content of CDATA.

              comment
                     Output  comment  declarations.  Comment declarations in the
                     DTD will not be output.

              lower  Prefer lower case. Names that were subjected to  upper-case
                     substitution  by  SGML  will  be folded to lower case. This
                     does not include reserved names; XML requires these  to  be
                     in upper-case.

              pi-escape
                     Escape &amp;&lt;&gt; in the contents of processing instructions using
                     the  amp,  lt  and  gt  entities.  This  allows  processing
                     instructions  to  contain  the string &gt;?, but requires that
                     applications handle the escapes.

              empty  Use the &lt;e/&gt; syntax for element types e declared as EMPTY.

              attlist
                     Output a ATTLIST declaration for every  element  specifying
                     the  type  of  all  attributes.  The default will always be
                     #IMPLIED.

       Multiple -x options are allowed.
