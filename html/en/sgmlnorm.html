SGMLNORM(1)                                                          SGMLNORM(1)



NAME
       sgmlnorm - normalize SGML documents

       An  SGML System Conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard
       Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlnorm [ -Cdemnv ]  [ -bbctf ]  [ -ccatalog ]  [ -Ddir ]  [ -iname ]  [
       -wwarning ]  sysid...

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlnorm prints on the standard output a normalized document instance for
       the SGML document contained in the concatenation  of  the  entities  with
       system identifiers sysid...

       When  the normalized instance is prefixed with the original SGML declara&#8208;
       tion and prolog, it will have the same ESIS as the  original  SGML  docu&#8208;
       ment, with the following exceptions:

       &#183; The  output  of  sgmlnorm  does  not protect against the recognition of
         short reference delimiters, so any USEMAP declarations must be  removed
         from the DTD.

       &#183; The  normalized instance will use the reference delimiters, even if the
         original instance did not.

       &#183; If marked sections are included in the output using the -m option,  the
         reference  reserved  names will be used for the status keywords even if
         the original instance did not.

       &#183; Any ESIS information relating to the SGML LINK feature will be lost.

       The normalized instance will not use  any  markup  minimization  features
       except that:

       &#183; Any  attributes  that  were not specified in the original instance will
         not be included in the normalized instance.  (Current  attributes  will
         be included.)

       &#183; If  the  declared  value  of an attribute was a name token group, and a
         value was specified that was the same as the  name  of  the  attribute,
         then the attribute name and value indicator will be omitted.  For exam&#8208;
         ple, with HTML sgmlnorm would output &lt;DL COMPACT&gt; rather than &lt;DL  COM&#8208;
         PACT=&quot;COMPACT&quot;&gt;.

OPTIONS
       -bbctf Use  the BCTF name bctf for output.  See nsgmls(1) for more infor&#8208;
              mation about this option.

       -cfile Use the catalog entry file file.

       -C     The filename... arguments specify catalog files  rather  than  the
              document  entity.  The  document  entity is specified by the first
              DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.

       -d     Output a document type declaration with the same external  identi&#8208;
              fier  as the input document, and with no internal declaration sub&#8208;
              set.  No check is performed that the document  instance  is  valid
              with respect to this DTD.

       -Ddirectory
              Search directory for files specified in system identifiers. Multi&#8208;
              ple -D options are allowed. See  nsgmls(1)  for  more  information
              about this option.

       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.

       -iname Pretend that &lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;INCLUDE&quot;&gt; occurs at the start of the
              document type declaration subset  in  the  SGML  document  entity.
              Since  repeated definitions of an entity are ignored, this defini&#8208;
              tion will take precedence  over  any  other  definitions  of  this
              entity  in  the document type declaration. Multiple -i options are
              allowed. If  the  SGML  declaration  replaces  the  reserved  name
              INCLUDE then the new reserved name will be the replacement text of
              the entity. Typically the document type declaration  will  contain
              &lt;!ENTITY  %  name &quot;IGNORE&quot;&gt; and will use %name; in the status key&#8208;
              word specification of a marked section declaration. In  this  case
              the  effect  of the option will be to cause the marked section not
              to be ignored.

       -m     Output any  marked  sections  that  were  in  the  input  document
              instance.

       -n     Output any comments that were in the input document instance.

       -r     Raw  output.   Don&apos;t  perform  any  conversion on RSs and REs when
              printing the entity.  The entity would typically have the  storage
              manager attribute records=asis.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wtype Control  warnings and errors according to type.  See nsgmls(1) for
              the allowed values of type.
