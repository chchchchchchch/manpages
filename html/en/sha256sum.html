SHA256SUM(1)                      User Commands                     SHA256SUM(1)



NAME
       sha256sum - compute and check SHA256 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha256sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is
       -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --quiet
              don&apos;t print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don&apos;t output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --strict
              with --check, exit non-zero for any invalid input

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in  FIPS-180-2.   When  checking,  the
       input  should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to
       print a line with checksum, a character indicating type (`*&apos; for  binary,
       ` &apos; for text), and name for each FILE.
