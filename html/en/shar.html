SHAR(1)                                                                  SHAR(1)



NAME
       shar - create shell archives

SYNOPSIS
       shar [ options ] file ...
       shar -S [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       Shar  creates  &quot;shell  archives&quot; (or shar files) which are in text format
       and can be mailed.  These files may be unpacked later by  executing  them
       with  /bin/sh.   The resulting archive is sent to standard out unless the
       -o option is given.  A wide range of features provide extensive flexibil&#8208;
       ity  in manufacturing shars and in specifying shar &quot;smartness&quot;.  Archives
       may be &quot;vanilla&quot; or comprehensive.

OPTIONS
       Options have a one letter version starting  with  -  or  a  long  version
       starting  with  --.   The  exception  is --help, --version, --no-i18n and
       --print-text-domain-dir which does not have  short  versions.   Mandatory
       arguments  to  long options are mandatory for short options too.  Options
       can be given in any order.  Some options depend on each other:
            The -o option is required if the -l or -L option is used.
            The -n option is required if the -a option is used.
            See -V below.

   Giving feedback:
       --help Print a help summary on standard output, then immediately exits.

       --version
              Print the version number of the program on standard  output,  then
              immediately exits.

       -q --quiet --silent
              Do not output verbose messages locally when producing the archive.

   Selecting files:
       -p  --intermix-type
              Allow positional parameter options.  The options -B, -T, -z and -Z
              may be embedded, and files to the right of the option will be pro&#8208;
              cessed in the specified mode.

       -S  --stdin-file-list
              Read  list  of  files  to be packed from the standard input rather
              than from the command line.  Input must be in a  form  similar  to
              that  generated  by the find command, one filename per line.  This
              switch is especially useful when the command line  will  not  hold
              the list of files to be packed.  For example:

              find . -type f -print | \
                sort | \
                shar -S -Z -L50 -o /somewhere/big

              If  -p  is specified on the command line, then the options -B, -T,
              -z and -Z may be included in the standard input (on a  line  sepa&#8208;
              rate  from  filenames).   The  maximum number of lines of standard
              input, file names and options, may not exceed 1024.

   Splitting output:
       -o XXX  --output-prefix=XXX
              Save the archive to files XXX.01 thru XXX.nn instead of sending it
              to  standard out.  Must be used when the -l or the -L switches are
              used.

       -l XX  --whole-size-limit=XX
              Limit the output file size to XXk  bytes  but  don&apos;t  split  input
              files.

       -L XX  --split-size-limit=XX
              Limit  output file size to XXk bytes and split files if necessary.
              The archive parts created with this option  must  be  unpacked  in
              correct order.

   Controlling the shar headers:
       -n name  --archive-name=name
              Name  of  archive  to be included in the header of the shar files.
              See the -a switch.

       -s who@where  --submitter=who@where
              Override automatically determined submitter name.

       -a  --net-headers
              Allows automatic generation of headers:
                   Submitted-by: who@where
                   Archive-name: &lt;name&gt;/part##
              The &lt;name&gt; must be given with the -n switch.  If name  includes  a
              &apos;/&apos; &quot;/part&quot; isn&apos;t used.  Thus:
                 -n xyzzy                      produces:
                                               xyzzy/part01
                                               xyzzy/part02

                 -n xyzzy/patch                produces:
                                               xyzzy/patch01
                                               xyzzy/patch02

                 -n xyzzy/patch01.             produces:
                                               xyzzy/patch01.01
                                               xyzzy/patch01.02

              The  who@where  can be explicitly stated with the -s switch if the
              default isn&apos;t appropriate.   Who@where  is  essentially  built  as
              `whoami`@`uname`.

       -c  --cut-mark
              Start  the  shar  with  a  cut  line.  A line saying &apos;Cut here&apos; is
              placed at the start of each output file.

       -t  --translate
              Translate messages in the script.  If you have set the LANG  envi&#8208;
              ronment  variable,  messages printed by shar will be in the speci&#8208;
              fied language.  The produced script will still  be  emitted  using
              messages  in  the  lingua  franca of the computer world:  English.
              This option will cause the script messages to appear in  the  lan&#8208;
              guages  specified  by  the  LANG environment variable set when the
              script is produced.

   Selecting how files are stocked:
       -M  --mixed-uuencode
              Mixed mode.  Determine if the files are text or binary and archive
              correctly (default).  Files found to be binary are uudecoded prior
              to packing (USE OF UUENCODE IS NOT  APPRECIATED  BY  MANY  ON  THE
              NET).

       -T  --text-files
              Treat all files as text.

       -B  --uuencode
              Treat  all  files  as binary, use uuencode prior to packing.  This
              increases the size of the archive.  The recipient must have  uude&#8208;
              code  in  order to unpack.  (USE OF UUENCODE IS NOT APPRECIATED BY
              MANY ON THE NET).

       -z  --gzip
              Gzip and uuencode all files prior to packing.  The recipient  must
              have  uudecode  and  gzip  in order to unpack (USE OF UUENCODE AND
              GZIP IS NOT APPRECIATED BY MANY ON THE NET).

       -g LEVEL  --level-for-gzip=LEVEL
              When doing compression, use  &apos;-LEVEL&apos;  as  a  parameter  to  gzip.
              Default is 9.  The -g option turns on the -z option by default.

       -Z  --compress
              Compress  and  uuencode all files prior to packing.  The recipient
              must have uudecode and compress in order to unpack (USE  OF  UUEN&#8208;
              CODE  AND COMPRESS IS NOT APPRECIATED BY MANY ON THE NET).  Option
              -C is synonymous to -Z, but is being deprecated.

       -b BITS  --bits-per-code=BITS
              When doing compression, use &apos;-bBITS&apos; as a parameter  to  compress.
              The -B option turns on the -Z option by default.  Default value is
              12.

   Protecting against transmission errors:
       -w  --no-character-count
              Do NOT check each file with &apos;wc -c&apos; after unpack.  The default  is
              to check.

       -D  --no-md5-digest
              Do  NOT  use  &apos;md5sum&apos;  digest  to  verify the unpacked files. The
              default is to check.

       -F  --force-prefix
              Forces the prefix character (normally &apos;X&apos; unless the parameter  to
              the  -d option starts with &apos;X&apos;) to be prepended to every line even
              if not required.  This option may slightly increase  the  size  of
              the archive, especially if -B or -Z is used.

       -d XXX  --here-delimiter=XXX
              Use  XXX  to  delimit  the  files in the shar instead of SHAR_EOF.
              This is for those who want to personalize their shar files.

   Producing different kinds of shars:
       -V  --vanilla-operation
              Produce &quot;vanilla&quot; shars which rely only upon the existence of  sed
              and  echo  in  the  unsharing environment.  In addition, &quot;if test&quot;
              must also be supported unless the  -x  option  is  used.   The  -V
              silently  disables  options  offensive  to  the  &quot;network cop&quot; (or
              &quot;brown shirt&quot;), but does warn you if it is specified with -B,  -z,
              -Z, -p or -M (any of which does or might require uudecode, gzip or
              compress in the unsharing environment).

       -P  --no-piping
              Use temporary files instead of pipes in the shar file.

       -x  --no-check-existing
              Overwrite existing files without checking.  If neither -x  nor  -X
              is specified, the unpack will check for and not overwrite existing
              files when unpacking the archive.  If -c is passed as a  parameter
              to the script when unpacking:

                 sh archive -c

              then existing files will be overwritten unconditionally.

       -X  --query-user
              When  unpacking,  interactively  ask  the  user if files should be
              overwritten.  (DO NOT USE FOR SHARS SUBMITTED TO THE NET).

       -m  --no-timestamp
              Avoid generating &apos;touch&apos; commands to restore the file modification
              dates when unpacking files from the archive.

       -Q  --quiet-unshar
              Verbose OFF.  Disables the inclusion of comments to be output when
              the archive is unpacked.

       -f  --basename
              Restore by filename only, rather than path.   This  option  causes
              only  file  names to be used, which is useful when building a shar
              from several directories, or another directory.  Note  that  if  a
              directory  name is passed to shar, the substructure of that direc&#8208;
              tory will be restored whether -f is specified or not.

   Internationalization:
       --no-i18n
              Do not produce internationalized shell archives, use default  Eng&#8208;
              lish  messages.   By default, shar produces archives that will try
              to output messages in the unpackers preferred language (as  deter&#8208;
              mined  by  the LANG/LC_MESSAGES environmental variables) when they
              are unpacked.  If no message file for the  unpackers  language  is
              found at unpack time, messages will be in English.

       --print-text-domain-dir
              Prints the directory shar looks in to find messages files for dif&#8208;
              ferent languages, then immediately exits.

EXAMPLES
       shar *.c &gt; cprog.shar                # all C prog sources
       shar -Q *.[ch] &gt; cprog.shar          # non-verbose, .c and .h files
       shar -B -l28 -oarc.sh *.arc          # all binary .arc files, into
                                            # files arc.sh.01 thru arc.sh.NN
       shar -f /lcl/src/u*.c &gt; u.sh         # use only the filenames

WARNINGS
       No chmod or touch is ever generated for directories created when  unpack&#8208;
       ing.  Thus, if a directory is given to shar, the protection and modifica&#8208;
       tion dates of corresponding unpacked directory may not match those of the
       original.

       If  a  directory  is  passed  to  shar, it may be scanned more than once.
       Therefore, one should be careful not change the directory while  shar  is
       running.

       Be careful that the output file(s) are not included in the inputs or shar
       may loop until the disk fills up.  Be particularly careful when a  direc&#8208;
       tory  is  passed  to shar that the output files are not in that directory
       (or a subdirectory of that directory).

       Use of the -B, -z or -Z, and especially -M, may slow the archive  process
       considerably, depending on the number of files.

       Use  of -X produces shars which WILL cause problems with many unshar pro&#8208;
       cedures.  Use this feature only for archives to be passed among agreeable
       parties.  Certainly, -X is NOT for shell archives which are to be submit&#8208;
       ted to Usenet.  Usage of -B, -z or -Z in net shars will cause you  to  be
       flamed  off  the  earth.   Not  using -m or not using -F may also get you
       occasional complaints.
