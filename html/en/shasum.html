SHASUM(1)               Perl Programmers Reference Guide               SHASUM(1)



NAME
       shasum - Print or Check SHA Checksums

SYNOPSIS
        Usage: shasum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
        Print or check SHA checksums.
        With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

          -a, --algorithm   1 (default), 224, 256, 384, 512, 512224, 512256
          -b, --binary      read in binary mode
          -c, --check       read SHA sums from the FILEs and check them
          -p, --portable    read files in portable mode
                                produces same digest on Windows/Unix/Mac
          -t, --text        read in text mode (default)

        The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
          -s, --status      don&apos;t output anything, status code shows success
          -w, --warn        warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

          -h, --help        display this help and exit
          -v, --version     output version information and exit

        When verifying SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 checksums, indicate the
        algorithm explicitly using the -a option, e.g.

          shasum -a 512224 -c checksumfile

        The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-4.  When checking, the
        input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to
        print a line with checksum, a character indicating type (`*&apos; for binary,
        ` &apos; for text, `?&apos; for portable), and name for each FILE.

DESCRIPTION
       Running shasum is often the quickest way to compute SHA message digests.
       The user simply feeds data to the script through files or standard input,
       and then collects the results from standard output.

       The following command shows how easy it is to compute digests for typical
       inputs such as the NIST test vector &quot;abc&quot;:

               perl -e &quot;print qq(abc)&quot; | shasum

       Or, if you want to use SHA-256 instead of the default SHA-1, simply say:

               perl -e &quot;print qq(abc)&quot; | shasum -a 256

       Since shasum mimics the behavior of the combined GNU sha1sum, sha224sum,
       sha256sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum programs, you can install this script
       as a convenient drop-in replacement.

       shasum is implemented using the Perl module Digest::SHA or
       Digest::SHA::PurePerl.
