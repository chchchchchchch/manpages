SHELLS(5)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  SHELLS(5)



NAME
       shells - pathnames of valid login shells

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/shells  is  a  text  file which contains the full pathnames of valid
       login shells.  This file is consulted by  chsh(1)  and  available  to  be
       queried by other programs.

       Be aware that there are programs which consult this file to find out if a
       user is a normal user.  E.g.: ftp daemons traditionally  disallow  access
       to users with shells not included in this file.

FILES
       /etc/shells

EXAMPLE
       /etc/shells may contain the following paths:

              /bin/sh
              /bin/csh

SEE ALSO
       chsh(1), getusershell(3)
