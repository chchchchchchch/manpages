SHMGET(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  SHMGET(2)



NAME
       shmget - allocates a shared memory segment

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;

       int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

DESCRIPTION
       shmget()  returns  the identifier of the shared memory segment associated
       with the value of the argument key.  A new shared  memory  segment,  with
       size equal to the value of size rounded up to a multiple of PAGE_SIZE, is
       created if key has the value IPC_PRIVATE or  key  isn&apos;t  IPC_PRIVATE,  no
       shared memory segment corresponding to key exists, and IPC_CREAT is spec&#8208;
       ified in shmflg.

       If shmflg specifies both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL and a shared memory  seg&#8208;
       ment  already  exists for key, then shmget() fails with errno set to EEX&#8208;
       IST.  (This is analogous to the  effect  of  the  combination  O_CREAT  |
       O_EXCL for open(2).)

       The value shmflg is composed of:

       IPC_CREAT   to  create  a  new  segment.   If this flag is not used, then
                   shmget() will find the segment associated with key and  check
                   to see if the user has permission to access the segment.

       IPC_EXCL    used  with IPC_CREAT to ensure failure if the segment already
                   exists.

       mode_flags  (least significant 9 bits) specifying the permissions granted
                   to  the  owner,  group,  and world.  These bits have the same
                   format, and  the  same  meaning,  as  the  mode  argument  of
                   open(2).   Presently, the execute permissions are not used by
                   the system.

       SHM_HUGETLB (since Linux 2.6)
                   Allocate the segment using &quot;huge pages.&quot;  See the Linux  ker&#8208;
                   nel  source file Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt for further
                   information.

       SHM_NORESERVE (since Linux 2.6.15)
                   This flag serves the same purpose as  the  mmap(2)  MAP_NORE&#8208;
                   SERVE  flag.   Do  not  reserve  swap space for this segment.
                   When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is
                   possible  to  modify  the  segment.   When  swap space is not
                   reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon a write  if  no  physical
                   memory  is  available.   See  also the discussion of the file
                   /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5).

       When a new shared memory segment is created, its contents are initialized
       to  zero  values,  and  its associated data structure, shmid_ds (see shm&#8208;
       ctl(2)), is initialized as follows:

              shm_perm.cuid and shm_perm.uid are set to the effective user ID of
              the calling process.

              shm_perm.cgid  and  shm_perm.gid are set to the effective group ID
              of the calling process.

              The least significant 9 bits of shm_perm.mode are set to the least
              significant 9 bit of shmflg.

              shm_segsz is set to the value of size.

              shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime and shm_dtime are set to 0.

              shm_ctime is set to the current time.

       If  the  shared  memory segment already exists, the permissions are veri&#8208;
       fied, and a check is made to see if it is marked for destruction.

RETURN VALUE
       A valid segment identifier, shmid, is returned on success, -1 on error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The user does not have permission to access the shared memory seg&#8208;
              ment, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EEXIST IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL was specified and the segment exists.

       EINVAL A  new  segment was to be created and size &lt; SHMMIN or size &gt; SHM&#8208;
              MAX, or no new segment was to be created, a segment with given key
              existed, but size is greater than the size of that segment.

       ENFILE The  system  limit  on  the  total  number  of open files has been
              reached.

       ENOENT No segment exists for the given key, and IPC_CREAT was not  speci&#8208;
              fied.

       ENOMEM No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       ENOSPC All  possible shared memory IDs have been taken (SHMMNI), or allo&#8208;
              cating a segment of the requested size would cause the  system  to
              exceed the system-wide limit on shared memory (SHMALL).

       EPERM  The  SHM_HUGETLB flag was specified, but the caller was not privi&#8208;
              leged (did not have the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

       SHM_HUGETLB is a nonportable Linux extension.

NOTES
       The inclusion of &lt;sys/types.h&gt; and &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; isn&apos;t required on Linux or
       by  any version of POSIX.  However, some old implementations required the
       inclusion of these header files,  and  the  SVID  also  documented  their
       inclusion.   Applications intended to be portable to such old systems may
       need to include these header files.

       IPC_PRIVATE isn&apos;t a flag field but a key_t type.  If this  special  value
       is used for key, the system call ignores everything but the least signif&#8208;
       icant 9 bits of shmflg and creates a new shared memory segment  (on  suc&#8208;
       cess).

       The  following  limits  on  shared  memory  segment  resources affect the
       shmget() call:

       SHMALL System wide maximum of shared memory pages (on Linux,  this  limit
              can be read and modified via /proc/sys/kernel/shmall).

       SHMMAX Maximum  size  in bytes for a shared memory segment: policy depen&#8208;
              dent  (on  Linux,  this  limit  can  be  read  and  modified   via
              /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax).
&#12;       SHMMIN Minimum  size in bytes for a shared memory segment: implementation
              dependent (currently 1 byte, though  PAGE_SIZE  is  the  effective
              minimum size).

       SHMMNI System  wide maximum number of shared memory segments: implementa&#8208;
              tion dependent (currently 4096, was 128 before  Linux  2.3.99;  on
              Linux,  this  limit  can  be  read and modified via /proc/sys/ker&#8208;
              nel/shmmni).

       The implementation has no specific limits  for  the  per-process  maximum
       number of shared memory segments (SHMSEG).

   Linux Notes
       Until  version 2.3.30 Linux would return EIDRM for a shmget() on a shared
       memory segment scheduled for deletion.

BUGS
       The name choice IPC_PRIVATE was perhaps unfortunate, IPC_NEW  would  more
       clearly show its function.
