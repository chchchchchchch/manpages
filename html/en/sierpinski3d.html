NAME
       sierpinski3d - 3D Sierpinski triangle fractal.

SYNOPSIS
       sierpinski3d  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual visual] [-window]
       [-root] [-delay number]  [-speed  number]  [-depth  number]  [-wireframe]
       [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       This draws the three-dimensional variant of the recursive Sierpinski tri&#8208;
       angle fractal, using GL.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  20000  (0.02  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -speed number
               Number of frames before changing shape.  Default: 150.

       -depth number
               Max  depth  to  descend.   Default:  5.   You probably don&apos;t have
               enough memory for 6.

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
