LONGJMP(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 LONGJMP(3)



NAME
       longjmp, siglongjmp - nonlocal jump to a saved stack context

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

       void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);

       void siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       siglongjmp(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       longjmp() and setjmp(3) are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts
       encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.   longjmp()  restores
       the  environment saved by the last call of setjmp(3) with the correspond&#8208;
       ing env argument.  After longjmp() is completed, program  execution  con&#8208;
       tinues  as  if  the corresponding call of setjmp(3) had just returned the
       value val.  longjmp() cannot cause 0 to be  returned.   If  longjmp()  is
       invoked with a second argument of 0, 1 will be returned instead.

       siglongjmp() is similar to longjmp() except for the type of its env argu&#8208;
       ment.  If, and only if, the sigsetjmp(3) call that set this  env  used  a
       nonzero  savesigs  flag,  siglongjmp() also restores the signal mask that
       was saved by sigsetjmp(3).

RETURN VALUE
       These functions never return.

CONFORMING TO
       C89, C99, and POSIX.1-2001  specify  longjmp().   POSIX.1-2001  specifies
       siglongjmp().

NOTES
       POSIX  does not specify whether longjmp() will restore the signal context
       (see setjmp(3) for some more details).  If you want to portably save  and
       restore signal masks, use sigsetjmp(3) and siglongjmp().

       The  values  of  automatic  variables  are  unspecified  after  a call to
       longjmp() if they meet all the following criteria:

       &#183;  they are local to the function that made the  corresponding  setjmp(3)
          call;

       &#183;  their values are changed between the calls to setjmp(3) and longjmp();
          and

       &#183;  they are not declared as volatile.

       Analogous remarks apply for siglongjmp().

       longjmp() and siglongjmp() make programs hard to understand and maintain.
       If possible an alternative should be used.
