SIGNBIT(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 SIGNBIT(3)



NAME
       signbit - test sign of a real floating-point number

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       int signbit(x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       signbit():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       signbit()  is  a  generic macro which can work on all real floating-point
       types.  It returns a nonzero value if the value of x  has  its  sign  bit
       set.

       This  is  not the same as x &lt; 0.0, because IEEE 754 floating point allows
       zero to be signed.  The comparison -0.0 &lt; 0.0 is false, but signbit(-0.0)
       will return a nonzero value.

       NaNs and infinities have a sign bit.

RETURN VALUE
       The  signbit() macro returns nonzero if the sign of x is negative; other&#8208;
       wise it returns zero.

ERRORS
       No errors occur.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix
       with recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
