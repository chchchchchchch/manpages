Mono(signcode)                                                    Mono(signcode)



NAME
       signcode - Digitally sign an PE executable using an X.509 certificate.

SYNOPSIS
       signcode [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Digitally sign an PE executable (CLR assembly, Win32 EXE or DLL) using an
       X.509 certificate and it&apos;s associated private key. The signature is  com&#8208;
       patible  with  Authenticode(r) and can be validated with chktrust (either
       on Windows or on any platform supported by Mono).

OPTIONS
       -spc spcfile
              The Software Publisher File (spc) that contains the X.509 certifi&#8208;
              cate chain used to digitally sign the PE executable.

       -v pvkfile
              The  Private  Key File (pvk) that contains the private key used to
              digitally sign the PE executable. This private key must match  the
              public key inside the publisher X.509 certificate.

       -a md5 | sha1
              The  hash  algorithm  used in the digital signature of the PE exe&#8208;
              cutable. The default algorithm is MD5.

       -$ individual | commercial
              Add information about the publisher, i.e. if the signature is gen&#8208;
              erated by an individual or a commercial entity.

       -n description
              Add a textual description of the signed file.

       -i url Add a URL associated to the publisher or the signed file.

       -t url URL to a timestamp service to countersign the PE executable. Coun&#8208;
              tersignature is required if you want the PE  executable  signature
              to  be  valid  after  the publisher certificate expires. The coun&#8208;
              tersignature proves that the publisher had a  valid  (non-expired)
              certificate when the PE executable was signed.

       -tr #  Number of retries to get a timestamp for the countersignature.

       -tw #  Delay  (in seconds) between the retries to get a timestamp for the
              countersignature.

       -k name
              CryptoAPI key container name (when not using -v).

       -p name
              CryptoAPI provider name (when not using -v).

       -y #   CryptoAPI provider type (when not using -v or -p).

       -ky signature | exchange | #
              CryptoAPI key type (when not using -v).

       -r localMachine | currentUser
              CryptoAPI key location (when not using -v).

&#12;OTHER CODE SIGNING TECHNOLOGIES
       Assemblies are PE files that can also be  strongnamed  using  the  sn.exe
       tool. The order of code signature is important if a file requires both an
       Authenticode and a  strongname  signature.  Strongname  must  be  applied
       before  the  Authenticode  signature.  Applying  a  strongname  after the
       Authenticode signature, like re-signing an  assembly  (e.g.  delay-sign),
       will invalidate the Authenticode signature.

KNOWN RESTRICTIONS
       signcode cannot generate Authenticode signatures for CAB files.
