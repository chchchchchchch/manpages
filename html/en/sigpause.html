SIGPAUSE(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                SIGPAUSE(3)



NAME
       sigpause - atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigpause(int sigmask);  /* BSD */

       int sigpause(int sig);      /* System V / UNIX 95 */

DESCRIPTION
       Don&apos;t use this function.  Use sigsuspend(2) instead.

       The  function sigpause() is designed to wait for some signal.  It changes
       the process&apos;s signal mask (set of blocked signals), and then waits for  a
       signal  to arrive.  Upon arrival of a signal, the original signal mask is
       restored.

RETURN VALUE
       If sigpause() returns, it was interrupted by  a  signal  and  the  return
       value is -1 with errno set to EINTR.

CONFORMING TO
       The System V version of sigpause() is standardized in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
   History
       The  classical  BSD version of this function appeared in 4.2BSD.  It sets
       the process&apos;s signal mask to sigmask.  UNIX 95 standardized the incompat&#8208;
       ible  System V version of this function, which removes only the specified
       signal sig from the process&apos;s signal  mask.   The  unfortunate  situation
       with  two  incompatible  functions  with  the same name was solved by the
       sigsuspend(2) function, that takes a sigset_t * argument (instead  of  an
       int).

   Linux Notes
       On  Linux,  this  routine  is  a  system call only on the Sparc (sparc64)
       architecture.

       Libc4 and libc5 only know about the BSD version.

       Glibc uses the BSD version if  the  _BSD_SOURCE  feature  test  macro  is
       defined   and  none  of  _POSIX_SOURCE,  _POSIX_C_SOURCE,  _XOPEN_SOURCE,
       _GNU_SOURCE, or _SVID_SOURCE is defined.  Otherwise, the System V version
       is used.
