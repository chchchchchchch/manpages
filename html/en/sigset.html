SIGSET(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  SIGSET(3)



NAME
       sigset, sighold, sigrelse, sigignore - System V signal API

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

       sighandler_t sigset(int sig, sighandler_t disp);

       int sighold(int sig);

       int sigrelse(int sig);

       int sigignore(int sig);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sigset(), sighold(), sigrelse(), sigignore():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  are  provided in glibc as a compatibility interface for
       programs that make use of the historical System V signal API.   This  API
       is  obsolete:  new  applications  should use the POSIX signal API (sigac&#8208;
       tion(2), sigprocmask(2), etc.)

       The sigset() function modifies the disposition of the  signal  sig.   The
       disp  argument can be the address of a signal handler function, or one of
       the following constants:

       SIG_DFL
              Reset the disposition of sig to the default.

       SIG_IGN
              Ignore sig.

       SIG_HOLD
              Add sig to the process&apos;s signal mask, but leave the disposition of
              sig unchanged.

       If  disp  specifies the address of a signal handler, then sig is added to
       the process&apos;s signal mask during execution of the handler.

       If disp was specified as a value other than SIG_HOLD, then sig is removed
       from the process&apos;s signal mask.

       The dispositions for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be changed.

       The sighold() function adds sig to the calling process&apos;s signal mask.

       The  sigrelse()  function  removes  sig from the calling process&apos;s signal
       mask.

       The sigignore() function sets the disposition of sig to SIG_IGN.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sigset() returns SIG_HOLD if sig was blocked before the call,
       or  the  signal&apos;s  previous  disposition if it was not blocked before the
       call.  On error, sigset() returns -1, with  errno  set  to  indicate  the
       error.  (But see BUGS below.)
&#12;       The sighold(), sigrelse(), and sigignore() functions return 0 on success;
       on error, these functions return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       For sigset() see the ERRORS under sigaction(2) and sigprocmask(2).

       For sighold() and sigrelse() see the ERRORS under sigprocmask(2).

       For sigignore(), see the errors under sigaction(2).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.  These functions are obsolete: do not use them in new
       programs.    POSIX.1-2008   marks   sighold(),  sigignore(),  sigpause(),
       sigrelse(), and sigset() as obsolete,  recommending  the  use  of  sigac&#8208;
       tion(2), sigprocmask(2), pthread_sigmask(3), and sigsuspend(2) instead.

NOTES
       These functions appeared in glibc version 2.1.

       The sighandler_t type is a GNU extension; it is only used on this page to
       make the sigset() prototype more easily readable.

       The sigset() function provides reliable  signal  handling  semantics  (as
       when calling sigaction(2) with sa_mask equal to 0).

       On System V, the signal() function provides unreliable semantics (as when
       calling sigaction(2) with sa_mask equal to  SA_RESETHAND  |  SA_NODEFER).
       On  BSD, signal() provides reliable semantics.  POSIX.1-2001 leaves these
       aspects of signal() unspecified.  See signal(2) for further details.

       In order to wait for a signal, BSD and System V both provided a  function
       named  sigpause(3), but this function has a different argument on the two
       systems.  See sigpause(3) for details.

BUGS
       In versions of glibc before 2.2, sigset() did not unblock sig if disp was
       specified as a value other than SIG_HOLD.

       In  versions  of glibc before 2.5, sigset() does not correctly return the
       previous disposition of the signal in two cases.  First, if disp is spec&#8208;
       ified  as  SIG_HOLD,  then a successful sigset() always returns SIG_HOLD.
       Instead, it should return the previous disposition of the signal  (unless
       the signal was blocked, in which case SIG_HOLD should be returned).  Sec&#8208;
       ond, if the signal is currently blocked, then the return value of a  suc&#8208;
       cessful  sigset()  should be SIG_HOLD.  Instead, the previous disposition
       of the signal is returned.  These problems have been  fixed  since  glibc
       2.5.
