SIGSUSPEND(2)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              SIGSUSPEND(2)



NAME
       sigsuspend - wait for a signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sigsuspend(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sigsuspend()  temporarily replaces the signal mask of the calling process
       with the mask given by mask and then suspends the process until  delivery
       of  a signal whose action is to invoke a signal handler or to terminate a
       process.

       If the signal terminates the process, then sigsuspend() does not  return.
       If  the signal is caught, then sigsuspend() returns after the signal han&#8208;
       dler returns, and the signal mask is restored to  the  state  before  the
       call to sigsuspend().

       It  is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; specifying these signals
       in mask, has no effect on the process&apos;s signal mask.

RETURN VALUE
       sigsuspend() always returns -1, normally with the error EINTR.

ERRORS
       EFAULT mask points to memory which is not a valid  part  of  the  process
              address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Normally,  sigsuspend()  is  used  in  conjunction with sigprocmask(2) in
       order to prevent delivery of a signal during the execution of a  critical
       code  section.   The caller first blocks the signals with sigprocmask(2).
       When the critical code has completed, the caller then waits for the  sig&#8208;
       nals  by  calling  sigsuspend() with the signal mask that was returned by
       sigprocmask(2) (in the oldset argument).

       See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal sets.
