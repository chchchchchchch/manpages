DESCRIPTION
       siliconmotion  is  an  Xorg  driver for Silicon Motion based video cards.
       The driver is fully accelerated, and provides support for  the  following
       framebuffer  depths:  8,  16, and 24.  All visual types are supported for
       depth 8, and TrueColor visuals are supported for the other depths.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The siliconmotion driver supports PCI and AGP video cards  based  on  the
       following Silicon Motion chips:

       Lynx        SM910

       LynxE       SM810

       Lynx3D      SM820

       LynxEM      SM710

       LynxEM+     SM712

       Lynx3DM     SM720

       Cougar3DR   SM731

       MSOC        SM501,SM502

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer  to  xorg.conf(5)  for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this  driver.   All
       options  names  are  case  and white space insensitive when parsed by the
       server, for example,  &quot;lynxe&quot; and &quot;LynxE&quot; are equivalent.

       Multihead mode configuration is done through the RandR1.2 interface  (see
       xorg.conf(5) and xrandr(1) for further information). Hardware accelerated
       screen rotation and framebuffer resizing are only supported with the  EXA
       acceleration architecture (see the AccelMethod option below).

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet names
       may optionally be specified in the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
       override the auto-detection:

           &quot;lynx&quot;,    &quot;lynxe&quot;,   &quot;lynx3d&quot;,   &quot;lynxem&quot;,   &quot;lynxem+&quot;,   &quot;lynx3dm&quot;,
           &quot;cougar3dr&quot;, &quot;msoc&quot;.


       The following Cursor Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: on.

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Inverse of &quot;HWCursor&quot;.  Default: off.
&#12;
       The following display Options are supported:

       Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Set the video color key.  Default: a little off full blue.

       Option &quot;ByteSwap&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Turn  on  byte  swapping  for  capturing  using  SMI  demo  board.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;Interlaced&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Turn on interlaced video capturing.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;UseBIOS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Use  the BIOS to set the modes. This is used for custom panel tim&#8208;
              ings.  Default: off for SM72x and SM5xx, otherwise on.

       Option &quot;Dualhead&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable dualhead mode.  Currently not all chips are  supported  and
              hardware  video  overlay  (XV)  support may have some limitations.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;widthxheight&quot;
              Override LCD panel dimension autodetection.

       Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Don&apos;t actually program the hardware mode registers, but  leave  it
              as  set  by  the  operating  system. Only available on MSOC chips.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;CSCVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              CSC video uses color space conversion to render video directly  to
              the framebuffer, without using an overlay.  Only available on MSOC
              chips. Default: on.

       The following video memory Options are supported:

       Option &quot;mclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Sets the memory clock. You must specify the  units.   For  example
              50Mhz  is  the same as 50000Khz or 50000000Hz.  On MSOC chips this
              is the main clock source for all functional blocks, such as the 2D
              engine,  GPIO,  Video  Engine, and DMA Engine. This option is only
              used for debugging purposes on MSOC  chips.   Default:  probe  the
              memory clock value, and use it at server start.

       Option &quot;mxclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              Sets  the  memory  clock. You must specify the units.  For example
              50Mhz is the same as 50000Khz or 50000000Hz.  Clock source for the
              local  SDRAM  controller.  This  option  is only available on MSOC
              chips and used only for debugging purposes.   Default:  probe  the
              memory clock value, and use it at server start.

       The following acceleration and graphics engine Options are supported:

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot;
              Disable  acceleration.   Very useful for determining if the driver
              has problems with drawing and acceleration routines.  This is  the
              first  option  to try if your server runs but you see graphic cor&#8208;
              ruption on the screen.  Using it decreases performance, as it uses
              software  emulation  for  drawing  operations the video driver can
              accelerate with hardware.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Chooses  between  available  acceleration  architectures.    Valid
              options  are  XAA  and  EXA.   XAA is the traditional acceleration
              architecture and support for it is very stable.  EXA  is  a  newer
              acceleration  architecture  with better performance for the Render
              and Composite extensions, but the rendering code for it  is  newer
              and possibly unstable.  The default is XAA.


       The following PCI bus Options are supported:

       Option &quot;PciBurst&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              will enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few bro&#8208;
              ken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance.  Default: on.

       Option &quot;PciRetry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              will allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program  the  regis&#8208;
              ters.   PciBurst  must  be  enabled  for  this to work.  This will
              increase performance, especially for  small  fills/blits,  because
              the  driver  does not have to poll the card before sending it com&#8208;
              mands to make sure it is ready. It should work on most recent  PCI
              chipsets.  Default: value of PciBurst option.
