CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       Detailed  information  on  all  supported  options  can  be  obtained  at
       http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsisvga.shtml

       This manpage only covers a subset of the supported options.

       1. For all supported chipsets

       The following driver options are supported on all chipsets:

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable  or  enable  2D  acceleration.  Default:  acceleration  is
              enabled.

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable the HW cursor. Default: HWCursor is on.

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              The opposite of HWCursor. Default: SWCursor is off.

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Rotate  the display clockwise (&quot;CW&quot;) or counter-clockwise (&quot;CCW&quot;).
              This mode is unaccelerated. Using this option disables XVideo  and
              the  Resize  and Rotate extension (RandR). Rotation and reflection
              (see below) are mutually exclusive.  Default: no rotation.
&#12;       Option &quot;Reflect&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Reflect (mirror) the display horizontally (&quot;X&quot;), vertically  (&quot;Y&quot;)
              or both (&quot;XY&quot;). This mode is unaccelerated. Using this option dis&#8208;
              ables XVideo and the Resize and Rotate extension (RandR). Rotation
              (see  above)  and  reflection are mutually exclusive.  Default: no
              reflection.

       Option &quot;CRT1Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable gamma correction. (On the  300  and  315/330/340
              series,  this  option  only  affects CRT1 output).  Default: Gamma
              correction is enabled.

       2. Old series specific information

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory  present  for  all
       these  chips,  but in the case of the 6326, it will limit the memory size
       to 4MB. This is because the 6326&apos;s 2D engine can only  address  4MB.  The
       remaining memory seems to be intended for 3D texture data, since only the
       3D engine can address RAM above 4MB. However, you can override this limi&#8208;
       tation  using  the  &quot;VideoRAM&quot; option in the Device section if your board
       has more than 4MB and you need  to  use  it.  However,  2D  acceleration,
       XVideo and the HWCursor will be disabled in this case.

       For  the  6326,  the  driver  has two built-in modes for high resolutions
       which you should use  instead  of  the  default  ones.  These  are  named
       &quot;SIS1280x1024-75&quot;  and  &quot;SIS1600x1200-60&quot;  and  they will be added to the
       list of default modes. To use these modes, just place them in your Screen
       section. Example:

       Modes &quot;SIS1600x1200-60&quot; &quot;SIS1280x1024x75&quot; &quot;1024x768&quot; ...

       Of these modes, 1280x1024 is only available at 8, 15 and 16bpp. 1600x1200
       is available at 8bpp only.

       TV support for the 6326

       TV output is supported for the 6326. The driver will auto detect  a  con&#8208;
       nected TV and in this case add the following display modes to the list of
       available  display  modes:  &quot;PAL800x600&quot;,  &quot;PAL800x600U&quot;,   &quot;PAL720x540&quot;,
       &quot;PAL640x480&quot;, &quot;NTSC640x480&quot;, &quot;NTSC640x480U&quot; and &quot;NTSC640x400&quot;.  Use these
       modes like the hi-res modes described above.

       The following driver Options are supported on the old series:

       Option &quot;TurboQueue&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable TurboQueue mode.  Default: off  for  SIS530/620,
              on for the others

       Option &quot;FastVram&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable FastVram mode.  Enabling this sets the video RAM
              timing to one cycle per read operation instead of two cycles. Dis&#8208;
              abling  this  will  set  two cycles for read and write operations.
              Leaving this option out uses the default, which  varies  depending
              on the chipset.

       Option &quot;NoHostBus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              (SiS5597/5598  only).  Disable  CPU-to-VGA  host bus support. This
              speeds up CPU  to  video  RAM  transfers.  Default:  Host  bus  is
              enabled.

       Option &quot;NoXVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable XV (XVideo) extension support. Default: XVideo is on.

       Option &quot;NoYV12&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable  YV12  Xv  support. This might me required due to hardware
              bugs in some chipsets.  Disabling  YV12  support  forces  Xv-aware
              applications  to use YUV2 or XShm for video output.  Default: YV12
              support is on.

       Option &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              (6326 only) Valid parameters are PAL or NTSC.  The default is  set
              by a jumper on the card.

       Option &quot;TVXPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              (6326  only)  This option allows tuning the horizontal position of
              the image for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0

       Option &quot;TVYPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              (6326 only) This option allows tuning the vertical position of the
              image for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0

       Option &quot;SIS6326TVEnableYFilter&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              (6326  only)  This option allows enabling/disabling the Y (chroma)
              filter for TV output.

       Option &quot;SIS6326TVAntiFlicker&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              (6326 only) This option allow enabling/disabling the anti  flicker
              facility  for  TV  output.  Possible parameters are OFF, LOW, MED,
              HIGH  or  ADAPTIVE.   By  experience,  ADAPTIVE  yields  the  best
              results, hence it is the default.

       2. 300 and 315/330/340 series specific information

       The  300  and 315/330/340 series, except the XGI Z7, feature two CRT con&#8208;
       trollers and very often come with a video bridge for controlling LCD  and
       TV  output.  Hereinafter,  the  term CRT1 refers to the VGA output of the
       chip, and CRT2 refers to either LCD, TV or secondary VGA. Due  to  timing
       reasons,  only  one  CRT2 output can be active at the same time. But this
       limitation does not apply to using CRT1 and CRT2 at the same  time  which
       makes it possible to run the driver in dual head mode.

       The driver supports the following video bridges:

       SiS301 SiS301B(-DH) SiS301C SiS301LV SiS302(E)LV

       Instead  of  a video bridge, some machines have a third party LVDS trans&#8208;
       mitter to control LCD panels, and/or a Chrontel 7005 or 7019 for TV  out&#8208;
       put. All these are supported as well.

       About TV output

       The  driver  fully supports standard (PAL, NTSC, PAL-N, PAL-M) S-video or
       composite output as well as high definition TV (HDTV)  output  via  YPbPr
       plugs.   For  more  information on HDTV, please consult the author&apos;s web&#8208;
       site.

       As regards S-video and CVBS output, the SiS301 and the Chrontel 7005 only
       support  resolutions  up to 800x600. All others support resolutions up to
       1024x768. However, due to a hardware bug, Xvideo might  be  distorted  on
       SiS video bridges if running NTSC or PAL-M at 1024x768.

       About XVideo support

       XVideo  is  supported  on  all  chipsets of both families (except the XGI
       Volari Z7 which lacks hardware  support  for  video  overlays).  However,
       there  are some differences in hardware features which cause limitations.
       The 300 series as well as the SiS55x, M650, 651, 661FX,  M661FX,  M661MX,
       741, 741GX, M741, 76x, M76x support two video overlays. The SiS315/H/PRO,
       650/740, 330, 340 and the XGI Volari V3, V5 and V8 chips support only one
       such  overlay.  On chips with two overlays, one overlay is used for CRT1,
       the other for CRT2. On the other chipsets, the option &quot;XvOnCRT2&quot;  can  be
       used to select the desired output device (CRT1 or CRT2).

       About Merged Framebuffer support

       Merged  framebuffer mode is similar to dual head/Xinerama mode (for using
       two output devices of one card at the same time), but has  a  few  advan&#8208;
       tages  which  make  me  recommend  it  strongly over Xinerama. Please see
       http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed information.

       About dual-head support

       Dual head mode with or without Xinerama is fully supported,  be  it  with
       one  card driving two outputs, be it two cards. Note that colordepth 8 is
       not supported in dual head mode if run on one card with two outputs.

       The following driver Options are supported on  the  300  and  315/330/340
       series:

       Option &quot;NoXVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable XV (XVideo) extension support.  Default: XVideo is on.

       Option &quot;XvOnCRT2&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              On  chipsets  with only one video overlay, this option can used to
              bind the overlay to CRT1 ( if a monitor is detected  and  if  this
              option  is  either  unset  or  set  to false ) or CRT2 ( if a CRT2
              device is detected or forced, and if this option is set to true ).
              If  either only CRT1 or CRT2 is detected, the driver decides auto&#8208;
              matically. In Merged Framebuffer mode,  this  option  is  ignored.
              Default: overlay is used on CRT1

       Option &quot;ForceCRT1&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Force  CRT1 to be on of off. If a monitor is connected, it will be
              detected during server start. However, some old monitors  are  not
              detected  correctly.  In such cases, you may set this option to on
              in order to make the  driver  initialize  CRT1  anyway.   If  this
              option  is set to off , the driver will switch off CRT1.  Default:
              auto-detect

       Option &quot;ForceCRT2Type&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Force display type to one of: NONE , TV ,  SVIDEO  ,  COMPOSITE  ,
              SVIDEO+COMPOSITE , SCART , LCD , VGA ; NONE will disable CRT2. The
              SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SVIDEO+COMPOSITE and SCART parameters  are  for
              SiS  video bridges only and can be used to force the driver to use
              a specific TV output connector (if present). For  further  parame&#8208;
              ters, see the author&apos;s website.  Default: auto detect.

       Option &quot;CRT2Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable  gamma correction for CRT2. Only supported for
              SiS video bridges. Default: Gamma correction for CRT2 is on.

       Option &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Force the TV standard to either PAL or  NTSC.   On  some  machines
              with  630,  730  and the 315/330/340 series, PALM , PALN and NTSCJ
              are supported as well. Default: BIOS setting.

       Option &quot;TVXPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option allows tuning the horizontal position of the image for
              TV  output.  The  range  is  from  -32 to 32. Not supported on the
              Chrontel 7019. Default: 0

       Option &quot;TVYPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option allows tuning the vertical position of the  image  for
              TV  output.  The  range  is  from  -32 to 32. Not supported on the
              Chrontel 7019. Default: 0

       Option &quot;SISTVXScale&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option selects the horizontal zooming level  for  TV  output.
              The  range is from -16 to 16. Only supported on SiS video bridges.
              Default: 0

       Option &quot;SISTVYScale&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option selects the vertical zooming level for  TV  output  in
              the  following modes: 640x480, 800x600. On the 315/330/340 series,
              also 720x480, 720x576 and 768x576. The range is from -4 to 3. Only
              supported on SiS video bridges. Default: 0

       Option &quot;CHTVOverscan&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              On  machines with a Chrontel TV encoder, this can be used to force
              the TV mode to overscan or  underscan.   on  means  overscan,  off
              means underscan.  Default: BIOS setting.

       Option &quot;CHTVSuperOverscan&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              On machines with a Chrontel 7005 TV encoder, this option enables a
              super-overscan mode. This is only supported if the TV standard  is
              PAL.  Super  overscan  will  produce  an  image on the TV which is
              larger than the viewable area.

       The driver supports  many  more  options.  Please  see  http://www.winis&#8208;
       chhofer.eu/linuxsisvga.shtml for more information.

       3. 300 series specific information

       DRI is supported on the 300 series only. On Linux, prior to kernel 2.6.3,
       DRI requires the kernel&apos;s SiS framebuffer driver ( sisfb ). The  SiS  DRM
       kernel  driver  as  well as the SiS DRI client driver are required in any
       case.

       Sisfb, if installed and running, takes care of memory management for tex&#8208;
       ture  data.  In  order to prevent the X Server and sisfb from overwriting
       each other&apos;s data, sisfb reserves an amount of video  memory  for  the  X
       driver.   This amount can either be selected using sisfb&apos;s mem parameter,
       or auto-selected depending on the amount of total video RAM available.

       Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or  as  a  complete  frame&#8208;
       buffer driver. If you start sisfb with a valid mode (ie you gain a graph&#8208;
       ical console), the X  driver  can  communicate  with  sisfb  and  doesn&apos;t
       require  any  manual configuration for finding out about the video memory
       it is allowed to use.

       However, if you are running a 2.4 series Linux kernel and use  sisfb  for
       video  memory  management  only,  ie you started sisfb with mode=none and
       still have a text mode console, there is no communication  between  sisfb
       and the X driver. For this purpose, the

       Option &quot;MaxXFBMem&quot; &quot;integer&quot;

       exists.  This  option  must  be  set  to the same value as given to sisfb
       through its &quot;mem&quot; parameter, ie the amount of memory  to  use  for  X  in
       kilobytes.

       If you started sisfb without the mem argument, sisfb will reserve

       12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available,

       8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available,

       4096KB in all other cases.

       If you intend to use DRI on an integrated chipset (540, 630, 730), I rec&#8208;
       ommend setting the total video memory in the BIOS setup utility to 64MB.

       PLEASE NOTE: As of Linux 2.6.3 and under *BSD, sisfb is not required  for
       memory  management.  Hence,  this option is mandatory on such systems not
       running sisfb to decide how much memory X should reserve for DRI. If  the
       option is omitted, DRI will have no memory assigned, and all DRI applica&#8208;
       tions will quit with errors like &quot;failed to  allocate  Z-buffer&quot;  or  the
       like.

       Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  option  allows enabling or disabling DRI. By default, DRI is
              on.

       Option &quot;AGPSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option allows selecting the amount of AGP memory to  be  used
              for  DRI.   The amount is to be specified in megabyte, the default
              is 8.

KNOWN BUGS
