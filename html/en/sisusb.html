DESCRIPTION
       sisusb is an Xorg driver for SiS (Silicon Integrated Systems) video chips
       that are connected via a Net2280-based USB  dongle.  The  driver  is  not
       accelerated,  but provides support for colordepths of 8, 16 and 24 bpp as
       well as Render and other extensions.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The sisusb driver  supports  USB  video  cards  based  on  the  following
       chipsets:

       SiS315E/PRO

       The  SiS315E/PRO  features  two CRT controllers. However, in its USB ver&#8208;
       sion, only the first output, referred to as &quot;CRT1&quot;, is being used.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general  configuration  details  and  to
       sis(4)  for  more  information.  This manpage only covers a subset of the
       supported options.

       Detailed  information  on  all  supported  options  can  be  obtained  at
       http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisusbvga.shtml

       Please note that this driver requires a Linux kernel driver as well which
       is included in Linux 2.6.12 and later, as well as available at the afore&#8208;
       mentioned website.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or  disable  the hardware cursor. It is not recommended to
              disable the hardware cursor as this will increase  the  amount  of
              data transferred over the USB. Default: HWCursor is on.

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              The  opposite  of  HWCursor. This enables or disables the software
              cursor. This sort of cursor is slower because the pointer must  be
              painted  into  the  graphics display. This increases the amount of
              data transferred over the USB significantly. Default: SWCursor  is
              off.

       Option &quot;CRT1Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable  or disable gamma correction.  Default: Gamma correction is
              on.

       Option &quot;DisconnectTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
              This option determines how the driver will react to  a  disconnec&#8208;
              tion  of the USB device. If the integer supplied is -1, the driver
              will abort the X server immediately  upon  disconnection.  If  the
              value  given is 0, the driver will probe for a re-connection every
              2 seconds and in case the device  is  detected,  re-establish  the
              display.  If  the value is greater than 0, the driver will do this
              re-probing within the given number of seconds and abort the server
              if  it does not detect the device within this time-out. Default: 0
              (probe forever for device reconnection).

KNOWN BUGS
       none.
