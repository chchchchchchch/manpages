SKILL(1)                          User Commands                         SKILL(1)



NAME
       skill, snice - send a signal or report process status

SYNOPSIS
       skill [signal] [options] expression
       snice [new priority] [options] expression

DESCRIPTION
       These  tools  are  obsolete and unportable.  The command syntax is poorly
       defined.  Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep commands instead.

       The default signal for skill is TERM.  Use -l or  -L  to  list  available
       signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT,
       and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in  three  ways:  -9  -SIGKILL
       -KILL.

       The  default  priority  for snice is +4.  Priority numbers range from +20
       (slowest) to -20 (fastest).  Negative priority numbers are restricted  to
       administrative users.

OPTIONS
       -f, --fast
              Fast mode.  This option has not been implemented.

       -i, --interactive
              Interactive use.  You will be asked to approve each action.

       -l, --list
              List all signal names.

       -L, --table
              List all signal names in a nice table.

       -n, --no-action
              No  action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do
              not actually change the system.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose; explain what is being done.

       -w, --warnings
              Enable warnings.  This option has not been implemented.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

PROCESS SELECTION OPTIONS
       Selection criteria can be: terminal, user,  pid,  command.   The  options
       below may be used to ensure correct interpretation.

       -t, --tty tty
              The next expression is a terminal (tty or pty).

       -u, --user user
              The next expression is a username.

       -p, --pid pid
              The next expression is a process ID number.
&#12;       -c, --command command
              The next expression is a command name.

SIGNALS
       The behavior of signals is explained in signal(7) manual page.
