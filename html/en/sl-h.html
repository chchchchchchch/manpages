SL-H(6)                                                                  SL-H(6)



NAME
       sl-h  -  display  animations aimed to entertain users who liked to see SL
       runs on their screen.

SYNOPSIS
       sl-h [ -alFe ]

DESCRIPTION
       sl-h displays animations aimed to entertain users who like to see SL runs
       on  their  screen. This is a slightly modified version of sl command, but
       it runs much long to please you very well :)

OPTIONS
       -a     Some trouble happen! You&apos;ll feel pity for people who need help :-)

       -l     Display mini SL.

       -F     SL flys! (Do you know Japanese animation, &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; ?)

       -e     Allow interrupt by Ctrl+C (Default, as this is so heavy  and  vio&#8208;
              lent).

SEE ALSO
       ls(1)

BUGS
       It never shows contents of current directory.
