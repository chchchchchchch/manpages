SLABTOP(1)                        User Commands                       SLABTOP(1)



NAME
       slabtop - display kernel slab cache information in real time

SYNOPSIS
       slabtop [options]

DESCRIPTION
       slabtop displays detailed kernel slab cache information in real time.  It
       displays a listing of the top caches sorted by one  of  the  listed  sort
       criteria.   It  also  displays a statistics header filled with slab layer
       information.

OPTIONS
       Normal invocation of slabtop does not require any options.  The behavior,
       however,  can  be  fine-tuned  by specifying one or more of the following
       flags:

       -d, --delay=N
              Refresh the display every  n  in  seconds.   By  default,  slabtop
              refreshes  the  display every three seconds.  To exit the program,
              hit q.

       -s, --sort=S
              Sort by S, where S is one of the sort criteria.

       -o, --once
              Display the output once and then exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

SORT CRITERIA
       The following are valid sort criteria used to sort  the  individual  slab
       caches  and  thereby determine what are the &quot;top&quot; slab caches to display.
       The default sort criteria is to sort by the number of objects (&quot;o&quot;).

       The sort criteria can also be changed while slabtop is running by  press&#8208;
       ing the associated character.

       l   l   l.    character description    header   a    number   of   active
       objects ACTIVE    b    objects    per     slab    OBJ/SLAB     c    cache
       size     CACHE  SIZE l    number of slabs     SLABS v    number of active
       slabs   N/A n    name NAME o    number of objects   OBJS  p    pages  per
       slab N/A s    object size    OBJ SIZE u    cache utilization   USE

COMMANDS
       slabtop  accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.  The follow&#8208;
       ing are supported.  In the case of letters, both cases are accepted.

       Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change  the  sort
       routine. See the section SORT CRITERIA.

       &lt;SPACEBAR&gt;
              Refresh the screen.

       Q      Quit the program.

FILES
       /proc/slabinfo
              slab information
&#12;SEE ALSO
       free(1), ps(1), top(1), vmstat(8)

NOTES
       Currently,  slabtop  requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically, a ver&#8208;
       sion 1.1 or later /proc/slabinfo).  Kernel 2.2 should be supported in the
       future.

       The  slabtop  statistic  header  is  tracking how many bytes of slabs are
       being used and it not a measure of physical memory.  The &apos;Slab&apos; field  in
       the  /proc/meminfo  file is tracking information about used slab physical
       memory.
