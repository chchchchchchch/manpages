NAME
       slattach - attach a network interface to a serial line

SYNOPSIS
       slattach [-dehlLmnqv] [-c command] [-p proto] [-s speed] [tty]

DESCRIPTION
       Slattach is a tiny little program that can be used to put a normal termi&#8208;
       nal (&quot;serial&quot;) line into one of several &quot;network&quot;  modes,  thus  allowing
       you to use it for point-to-point links to other computers.

OPTIONS
       [-c command]
              Execute  command when the line is hung up. This can be used to run
              scripts or re-establish connections when a link goes down.

       [-d]   Enable debugging output.  Useful when determining why a given set&#8208;
              up doesn&apos;t work.

       [-h]   Exit  when  the  carrier  is lost. This works on both /dev/tty and
              /dev/cua devices by directly monitoring the carrier  status  every
              15 seconds.

       [-v]   Enable verbose output.  Useful in shell scripts.

       [-q]   Operate in quiet mode - no messages at all.

       [-l]   Create an UUCP-style lockfile for the device in /var/lock.

       [-n]   Equivalent to the &quot;mesg n&quot; command.

       [-m]   Do not initialize the line into 8 bits raw mode.

       [-e]   Exit  right  after initializing device, instead of waiting for the
              line to hang up.

       [-L]   Enable 3 wire operation. The terminal is moved into  CLOCAL  mode,
              carrier watching is disabled.

       [-p proto]
              Set  a  specific kind of protocol to use on the line.  The default
              is set to cslip, i.e. compressed SLIP.  Other possible values  are
              slip (normal SLIP), adaptive (adaptive CSLIP/SLIP), ppp (Point-to-
              Point Protocol) and kiss (a protocol used for  communicating  with
              AX.25  packet radio terminal node controllers).  The special argu&#8208;
              ment tty can be used to put the device  back  into  normal  serial
              operation.   Using  &apos;ppp&apos;  mode  is  not  normally  useful  as ppp
              requires an additional ppp daemon pppd to be active on  the  line.
              For kiss connections the axattach program should be used.

       [-s speed]
              Set a specific line speed, other than the default.

       If  no arguments are given, the current terminal line (usually: the login
       device) is used.  Otherwise, an attempt is made to  claim  the  indicated
       terminal port, lock it, and open it.

FILES
       /dev/cua* /var/lock/LCK.*
