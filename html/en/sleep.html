SLEEP(1)                          User Commands                         SLEEP(1)



NAME
       sleep - delay for a specified amount of time

SYNOPSIS
       sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]...
       sleep OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Pause  for  NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be `s&apos; for seconds (the default),
       `m&apos; for minutes, `h&apos; for hours or `d&apos; for days.  Unlike most  implementa&#8208;
       tions  that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbitrary
       floating point number.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount
       of time specified by the sum of their values.
