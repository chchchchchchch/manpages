NAME
       slidescreen - permute the screen image like an 8-puzzle

SYNOPSIS
       slidescreen  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-background color] [-grid-
       size pixels] [-ibw pixels] [-increment pixels]  [-delay  usecs]  [-delay2
       usecs]  [-duration  secs]  [-window]  [-root] [-install] [-visual visual]
       [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The slidescreen program takes an image, divides it into a grid, deletes a
       random square of that grid, and then randomly slides one of the neighbors
       of this &quot;hole&quot; into the hole (and repeat.)

       The image that it manipulates will be grabbed from  the  portion  of  the
       screen underlying the window, or from the system&apos;s video input, or from a
       random file on disk, as indicated  by  the  grabDesktopImages,  grabVide&#8208;
       oFrames,  and chooseRandomImages options in the ~/.xscreensaver file; see
       xscreensaver-demo(1) for more details.

OPTIONS
       slidescreen accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -grid-size pixels
               The size of the grid cells.  Default 70 pixels.

       -ibw pixels
               The size of the &quot;gutter&quot; between grid cells.  Default 4 pixel.

       -increment pixels
               How many pixels by which a piece should be moved when sliding  to
               a new location.  Default 10 pixels.

       -delay microseconds
               How  much  of  a  delay should be introduced between steps of the
               animation of the motion of each segment.  Default 50000, which is
               0.05  seconds.  This is closely related to the -increment parame&#8208;
               ter.

       -delay2 microseconds
               How much of a delay should be introduced between the end  of  the
               motion of one segment and the beginning of the motion of another.
               Default 1000000, which is one second.

       -duration seconds
               How long to run before loading a new image.  Default 120 seconds.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.
&#12;       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
