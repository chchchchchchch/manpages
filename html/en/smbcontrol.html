SMBCONTROL(1)                     User Commands                    SMBCONTROL(1)



NAME
       smbcontrol - send messages to smbd, nmbd or winbindd processes

SYNOPSIS
       smbcontrol [-i] [-s]

       smbcontrol [destination] [message-type] [parameter]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       smbcontrol is a very small program, which sends messages to a smbd(8), a
       nmbd(8), or a winbindd(8) daemon running on the system.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       -s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
           server. The information in this file includes server-specific
           information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
           descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
           smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       -i
           Run interactively. Individual commands of the form destination
           message-type parameters can be entered on STDIN. An empty command
           line or a &quot;q&quot; will quit the program.

       destination
           One of nmbd, smbd or a process ID.

           The all destination causes the message to &quot;broadcast&quot; to all running
           daemons including nmbd and winbind. This is a change for Samba 3.3,
           prior to this the parameter smbd used to do this.

           The smbd destination causes the message to be sent to the smbd daemon
           specified in the smbd.pid file.

           The nmbd destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd daemon
           specified in the nmbd.pid file.

           The winbindd destination causes the message to be sent to the winbind
           daemon specified in the winbindd.pid file.

           If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that
           process.

       message-type
           Type of message to send. See the section MESSAGE-TYPES for details.

       parameters
           any parameters required for the message-type

MESSAGE-TYPES
       Available message types are:

       close-share
           Order smbd to close the client connections to the named share. Note
           that this doesn&#180;t affect client connections to any other shares. This
           message-type takes an argument of the share name for which client
           connections will be closed, or the &quot;*&quot; character which will close all
           currently open shares. This may be useful if you made changes to the
           access controls on the share. This message can only be sent to smbd.

       debug
           Set debug level to the value specified by the parameter. This can be
           sent to any of the destinations. If this message is sent to either
           the smbd or winbindd daemons, the parent process will rebroadcast the
           message to all child processes changing the debug level in each one.

       force-election
           This message causes the nmbd daemon to force a new browse master
           election.

       ping
           Send specified number of &quot;ping&quot; messages and wait for the same number
           of reply &quot;pong&quot; messages. This can be sent to any of the
           destinations.

       profile
           Change profile settings of a daemon, based on the parameter. The
           parameter can be &quot;on&quot; to turn on profile stats collection, &quot;off&quot; to
           turn off profile stats collection, &quot;count&quot; to enable only collection
           of count stats (time stats are disabled), and &quot;flush&quot; to zero the
           current profile stats. This can be sent to any smbd or nmbd
           destinations.

       debuglevel
           Request debuglevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout. This
           can be sent to any of the destinations.

       profilelevel
           Request profilelevel of a certain daemon and write it to stdout. This
           can be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations.

       printnotify
           Order smbd to send a printer notify message to any Windows NT clients
           connected to a printer. This message-type takes the following
           arguments:

           queuepause printername
               Send a queue pause change notify message to the printer
               specified.

           queueresume printername
               Send a queue resume change notify message for the printer
               specified.

           jobpause printername unixjobid
               Send a job pause change notify message for the printer and unix
               jobid specified.

           jobresume printername unixjobid
               Send a job resume change notify message for the printer and unix
               jobid specified.

           jobdelete printername unixjobid
               Send a job delete change notify message for the printer and unix
               jobid specified.

           Note that this message only sends notification that an event has
           occurred. It doesn&#180;t actually cause the event to happen.

           This message can only be sent to smbd.
&#12;       samsync
           Order smbd to synchronise sam database from PDC (being BDC). Can only
           be sent to smbd.

               Note
               Not working at the moment

       samrepl
           Send sam replication message, with specified serial. Can only be sent
           to smbd. Should not be used manually.

       dmalloc-mark
           Set a mark for dmalloc. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd. Only
           available if samba is built with dmalloc support.

       dmalloc-log-changed
           Dump the pointers that have changed since the mark set by
           dmalloc-mark. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd. Only available if
           samba is built with dmalloc support.

       shutdown
           Shut down specified daemon. Can be sent to both smbd and nmbd.

       pool-usage
           Print a human-readable description of all talloc(pool) memory usage
           by the specified daemon/process. Available for both smbd and nmbd.

       drvupgrade
           Force clients of printers using specified driver to update their
           local version of the driver. Can only be sent to smbd.

       reload-config
           Force daemon to reload smb.conf configuration file. Can be sent to
           smbd, nmbd, or winbindd.

       idmap
           Notify about changes of id mapping. Can be sent to smbd or (not
           implemented yet) winbindd.

           flush [uid|gid]
               Flush caches for sid &lt;-&gt; gid and/or sid &lt;-&gt; uid mapping.

           delete &lt;ID&gt;
               Remove a mapping from cache. The mapping is given by &lt;ID&gt; which
               may either be a sid: S-x-..., a gid: &quot;GID number&quot; or a uid: &quot;UID
               number&quot;.

           kill &lt;ID&gt;
               Remove a mapping from cache. Terminate smbd if the id is
               currently in use.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
       Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source
       project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
       sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
       Source software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and
       updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
       DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
