NAME
       mcs, gmcs, smcs - Mono C# Compiler (1.0, 2.0, Moonlight)

SYNOPSIS
       mcs [option] [source-files]

DESCRIPTION
       mcs  is  the Mono C# compiler, an implementation of the ECMA-334 language
       specification.  You can pass one or more options to drive  the  compiler,
       and a set of source files.  Extra options or arguments can be provided in
       a response file.  Response files are referenced by prepending the @  sym&#8208;
       bol to the response file name.

       The  mcs  compiler  is used to compile against the 1.x profile and imple&#8208;
       ments C# 1.0 and parts of C# 2.0 and C# 3.0 specification  which  do  not
       depend on generics.

       The  gmcs  compiler is used to compile against the 2.0 profile and imple&#8208;
       ments the complete C# 3.0 specification.

       The smcs compiler is used to compile  against  the  Silverlight/Moonlight
       profile.   This  profile  is  designed  to  be  used  for  creating  Sil&#8208;
       verlight/Moonlight applications that will run on a web browser.   The API
       exposed  by  this profile is a small subset of the 3.5 API (even if it is
       commonly referred as the 2.1 API, this API is a small subset of 2.0  with
       a few extensions).

       See the section on packages for more information.

       The  Mono  C# compiler accepts the same command line options that the Mi&#8208;
       crosoft C# compiler does.  Those options can start with a slash or a dash
       (/checked  is  the same as -checked).  Additionally some GNU-like options
       are supported, those begin with &quot;--&quot;.  All MCS-specific flags  which  are
       not  available  in  the Microsoft C# compiler are available only with the
       GNU-style options.

       C# source files must end with  a  &quot;.cs&quot;  extension.   Compilation  of  C#
       source code requires all the files that make up a library, module or exe&#8208;
       cutable to be provided on the command line.  There is no support for par&#8208;
       tial  compilation.   To  achieve the benefits of partial compilation, you
       should compile programs into their own assemblies,  and  later  reference
       them with the &quot;-r&quot; flag.

       The  Mono C# compiler generates images (.exe files) that contain CIL byte
       code that can be executed by any system that implements a Common Language
       Infrastructure  virtual machine such as the Microsoft .NET runtime engine
       on Windows or the Mono runtime engine on Unix systems.   Executables  are
       not bound to a specific CPU or operating system.

       The  Mono C# compiler by default only references three assemblies: mscor&#8208;
       lib.dll, System.dll and System.Xml.dll.   If you want to reference  extra
       libraries  you  must  manually  specify them using the -pkg: command line
       option or the -r: command line option.  Alternatively if you want to  get
       all  of  the  System  libraries, you can use the -pkg:dotnet command line
       option.

OPTIONS
       --about
              Displays information about the Mono C# compiler

       --addmodule:MODULE1[,MODULE2]
              Includes the specified modules in the resulting assembly.  Modules
              are created by calling the compiler with the -target:module option

       -checked, -checked+
              Sets  the  default  compilation mode to `checked&apos;.  This makes all
              the math operations checked (the default is unchecked).

       -checked-
              Sets the default compilation mode to `unchecked&apos;.  This makes  all
              the math operations unchecked (this is the default).

       -clscheck-, -clscheck+
              Disables or enables the Common Language Specification (CLS) checks
              (it is enabled by default).

              The Common Language Specification (CLS) defines  an  interoperable
              subset of types as well as conventions that compilers (CLS produc&#8208;
              ers) and developers must follow to expose code to  other  program&#8208;
              ming languages (CLS consumers).

       -codepage:ID
              Specifies  the  code page used to process the input files from the
              point it is specified on.  By default files will be  processed  in
              the  environment-dependent  native  code  page.  The compiler will
              also automatically detect Unicode files that have an embedded byte
              mark at the beginning.

              Other  popular encodings are 28591 (Latin1), 1252 (iso-8859-1) and
              65001 (UTF-8).

              MCS supports a couple of shorthands: &quot;utf8&quot; can be used to specify
              utf-8  instead of using the cryptic 65001 and &quot;reset&quot; restores the
              automatic handling of code pages.  These shorthands are not avail&#8208;
              able on the Microsoft compiler.

       -define:SYMLIST, -d:SYMLIST
              Defines the symbol listed by the semi-colon separated list SYMLIST
              SYMBOL.  This can be tested in the source code by the  pre-proces&#8208;
              sor, or can be used by methods that have been tagged with the Con&#8208;
              ditional attribute.

       -debug, -debug+
              Generate debugging  information.   To  obtain  stack  traces  with
              debugging  information,  you  need to invoke the mono runtime with
              the `--debug&apos; flag.  This debugging information is  stored  inside
              the assembly as a resource.

       -debug-
              Do not generate debugging information.

       -delaysign+
              Only embed the strongname public key into the assembly. The actual
              signing must be done in a later stage using the SN tool.  This  is
              useful  to  protect  the private key during development. Note that
              delay signing can only be done using a strongname key file (not  a
              key  container).  The option is equivalent to including [assembly:
              AssemblyDelaySign (true)] in your  source  code.  Compiler  option
              takes precedence over the attributes.

       -delaysign-
              Default.  Strongname (sign) the assembly using the strong name key
              file (or container). The option is equivalent to including [assem&#8208;
              bly:  AssemblyDelaySign  (false)]  in  your  source code. Compiler
              option takes precedence over the attributes.

       -doc:FILE
              Extracts the C#/XML documentation from the source code and  stores
              in in the given FILE.
&#12;       -errorreport
              This  flag is ignored by Mono&apos;s C# compiler and is present only to
              allow MCS to be used as a CSC replacement for msbuild/xbuild.

       --fatal
              This is used for debugging the compiler.   This  makes  the  error
              emission generate an exception that can be caught by a debugger.

       -filealign
              This  flag is ignored by Mono&apos;s C# compiler and is present only to
              allow MCS to be used as a CSC replacement for msbuild/xbuild.

       -keyfile:KEYFILE
              Strongname (sign) the output assembly using the key  pair  present
              in  the  specified  strong name key file (snk). A full key pair is
              required by default (or when using delaysign-). A file  containing
              only  the  public  key  can be used with delaysign+. The option is
              equivalent to including [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile (&quot;KEYFILE&quot;)] in
              your  source  code.   Compiler  option  takes  precedence over the
              attributes.

       -keycontainer:CONTAINER
              Strongname (sign) the output assembly using the key  pair  present
              in  the  specified container. Note that delaysign+ is ignored when
              using key  containers.  The  option  is  equivalent  to  including
              [assembly:  AssemblyKeyName  (&quot;CONTAINER&quot;)]  in  your source code.
              Compiler option takes precedence over the attributes.

       -langversion:TEXT
              The option specifies the version of the language to use. The  fea&#8208;
              ture  set is different in each C# version. This switch can be used
              to force the compiler to allow only a subset of the features.  The
              possible values are:

              Default
                     Instruct  compiler to use the latest version. Equivalent is
                     to omit the switch (this currently defaults to the  C#  3.0
                     language specification).

              ISO-1  Restrict  compiler  to use only first ISO standardized fea&#8208;
                     tures.  The usage of  features  such  as  generics,  static
                     classes, anonymous methods will lead to error.

              ISO-2  Restrict  compiler  to use only the second ISO standardized
                     features.  This allows the use of generics, static classes,
                     iterators and anonymous methods for example.

              3      Restrict the compiler to use only the features available in
                     C# 3.0 (a superset of ISO-1 and ISO-2).

              future Enables features from upcoming versions  of  the  language.
                     As  of  May 2009 this includes support for C# 4 as released
                     in Visual Studio 2010 beta 1.

              Notice that this flag only controls the language  features  avail&#8208;
              able to the programmer, it does not control the kind of assemblies
              produced.  Programs compiled with mcs will reference the 1.1 APIs,
              Programs compiled with gmcs reference the 2.0 APIs.

       -lib:PATHLIST
              Each  path  specified  in the comma-separated list will direct the
              compiler to look for libraries in that specified path.

       -L PATH
              Directs the compiler to look for libraries in the specified  path.
              Multiple paths can be provided by using the option multiple times.
&#12;       -main:CLASS
              Tells  the  compiler  which CLASS contains the entry point. Useful
              when you are compiling several classes with a Main method.

       -nostdlib, -nostdlib+
              Use this flag if you want to compile the core library.  This makes
              the  compiler load its internal types from the assembly being com&#8208;
              piled.

       -noconfig, -noconfig+
              Disables the default compiler configuration  to  be  loaded.   The
              compiler by default has references to the system assemblies.

       -nowarn:WARNLIST
              Makes  the  compiler  ignore warnings specified in the comma-sepa&#8208;
              rated list WARNLIST&gt;

       -optimize, -optimize+, -optimize-
              Controls whether to perform optimizations on the code.   -optimize
              and -optimize+ will turn on optimizations, -optimize- will turn it
              off.  The default in mcs is to optimize+.

       -out:FNAME, -o FNAME
              Names the output file to be generated.

       --parse
              Used for benchmarking.  The compiler will  only  parse  its  input
              files.

       -pkg:package1[,packageN]
              Reference assemblies for the given packages.

              The  compiler will invoke pkg-config --libs on the set of packages
              specified on the command line to obtain libraries and  directories
              to compile the code.

              This is typically used with third party components, like this:

                        $ mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp demo.cs

              -pkg:dotnet
                     This  will  instruct the compiler to reference the System.*
                     libraries available on a typical dotnet framework installa&#8208;
                     tion,  notice  that  this  does not include all of the Mono
                     libraries, only the System.* ones.  This  is  a  convenient
                     shortcut for those porting code.

              -pkg:olive
                     Use  this  to  reference the &quot;Olive&quot; libraries (the 3.0 and
                     3.5 extended libraries).

              -pkg:silver
                     References  the  assemblies  for  creating   Moonlight/Sil&#8208;
                     verlight  applications.   This  is  automatically used when
                     using the smcs compiler, but it  is  here  when  developers
                     want to use it with the gmcs compiler.

              -pkg:silverdesktop
                     Use  this  option  to create Moonlight/Silverlight applica&#8208;
                     tions that target the desktop.   This option allows  devel&#8208;
                     opers  to  consume  the  Silverlight APIs with the full 2.0
                     profile API available to them, unlike smcs  it  gives  full
                     access  to  all  the  APIs that are part of Mono.  The only
                     downside is that applications  created  with  silverdesktop
                     will not run on the browser.   Typically these applications
                     will be launched with the mopen command line tool.
&#12;              For more details see the PACKAGE section in this document

       -platform:ARCH
              Used to specify the target platform. The possible values are: any&#8208;
              cpu,  x86,  x64 or itanium. As of June 2009, the Mono runtime only
              have support to emit anycpu and x86 assemblies.

       -resource:RESOURCE[,ID]
              Embeds to the given resource file.  The optional ID can be used to
              give  a  different  name  to  the resource.  If not specified, the
              resource name will be the file name.

       -linkresource:RESOURCE[,ID]
              Links to the specified RESOURCE.  The optional ID can be  used  to
              give a name to the linked resource.

       -r:ASSEMBLY1[,ASSEMBLY2], -reference ASSEMBLY1[,ASSEMBLY2]
              Reference  the named assemblies.  Use this to use classes from the
              named assembly in your program.  The assembly will be loaded  from
              either the system directory where all the assemblies live, or from
              the path explicitly given with the -L option.

              You can also use a semicolon to separate the assemblies instead of
              a comma.

       -reference:ALIAS=ASSEMBLY
              Extern alias reference support for C#.

              If  you have different assemblies that provide the same types, the
              extern alias support allows you to provide names that  your  soft&#8208;
              ware can use to tell those appart.    The types from ASSEMBLY will
              be exposed as ALIAS, then on the C# source code, you need to do:

                   extern alias ALIAS;
              To bring it into your namespace.   For example, to cope  with  two
              graphics   libraries   that   define   &quot;Graphics.Point&quot;,   one  in
              &quot;OpenGL.dll&quot; and one in &quot;Postscript.dll&quot;,  you  would  invoke  the
              compiler like this:

                   mcs -r:Postscript=Postscript.dll -r:OpenGL=OpenGL.dll

              And in your source code, you would write:

                   extern alias Postscript;
                   extern alias OpenGL;

                   class X {
                        // This is a Graphics.Point from Postscrip.dll
                        Postscript.Point p = new Postscript.Point ();

                        // This is a Graphics.Point from OpenGL.dll
                        OpenGL.Point p = new OpenGL.Point ();
                   }

       -recurse:PATTERN, --recurse PATTERN
              Does  recursive  compilation using the specified pattern.  In Unix
              the shell will perform globbing, so you might want to use it  like
              this:

                 $ mcs -recurse:&apos;*.cs&apos;

       -sdk:VERSION
              Used  to specify the version of Base Class Library assemblies. The
              possible values are: 2 (default),  4.  The  version  number  means
              which  .NET  version  should  the  produced assembly be compatible
              with.
&#12;       --shell
              Starts up the compiler in interactive mode, providing a  C#  shell
              for  statements and expressions.   A shortcut is to use the csharp
              command directly.

       --stacktrace
              Generates a stack trace at the time the error is reported,  useful
              for debugging the compiler.

       -target:KIND, -t:KIND
              Used  to specify the desired target.  The possible values are: exe
              (plain executable),  winexe  (Windows.Forms  executable),  library
              (component libraries) and module (partial library).

       --timestamp
              Another  debugging  flag.   Used  to  display the times at various
              points in the compilation process.

       -unsafe, -unsafe+
              Enables compilation of unsafe code.

       -v     Debugging. Turns on verbose yacc parsing.

       --version
              Shows the compiler version.

       -warnaserror, -warnaserror+
              All compilers warnings will be reported as errors.

       -warnaserror:W1,[Wn], -warnaserror+:W1,[Wn]
              Treats one or more compiler warnings as errors.

       -warnaserror-:W1,[Wn]
              Sets one or more compiler warnings to be always threated as  warn&#8208;
              ings.  Becomes useful when used together with -warnaserror.

       -warn:LEVEL
              Sets  the  warning level.  0 is the lowest warning level, and 4 is
              the highest.  The default is 4.

       -win32res:FILE
              Specifies a Win32 resource file (.res)  to  be  bundled  into  the
              resulting assembly.

       -win32icon:FILE
              Attaches the icon specified in FILE on the output into the result&#8208;
              ing assembly.

       --     Use this to stop option parsing, and allow option-looking  parame&#8208;
              ters to be passed on the command line.

PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES
       When  referencing an assembly, if the name of the assembly is a path, the
       compiler will try to load the assembly specified in  the  path.    If  it
       does  not,  then the compiler will try loading the assembly from the cur&#8208;
       rent directory, the compiler base directory and if the  assembly  is  not
       found in any of those places in the directories specified as arguments to
       the -lib: command argument.

       Depending on the invocation for the C# compiler (mcs, gmcs, or smcs)  you
       will  get a default set of libraries and versions of those libraries that
       are referenced.

       The compiler uses the library path to locate libraries, and  is  able  to
       reference  libraries from a particular package if that directory is used.
       To simplify the use of packages, the C# compiler includes the -pkg:  com&#8208;
       mand line option that is used to load specific collections of libraries.

       Libraries visible to the compiler are stored relative to the installation
       prefix under PREFIX/lib/mono/ called the PACKAGEBASE and the defaults for
       mcs, gmcs and smcs are as follows:

       mcs    References the PACKAGEBASE/1.0 directory

       gmcs   References the PACKAGEBASE/2.0 directory

       smcs   References the PACKAGEBASE/2.1 directory

       Those  are the only runtime profiles that exist.  Although other directo&#8208;
       ries exist (like 3.0 and 3.5) those are not really runtime profiles, they
       are merely placeholders for extra libraries that build on the 2.0 founda&#8208;
       tion.

       Software providers will distribute software that is installed relative to
       the PACKAGEBASE directory.  This is integrated into the gacutil tool that
       not only installs public assemblies into the Global Assembly Cache  (GAC)
       but  also  installs them into the PACKAGEBASE/PKG directory (where PKG is
       the name passed to the -package flag to gacutil).

       As a developer, if you want to consume  the  Gtk#  libraries,  you  would
       invoke the compiler like this:

            $ mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0 main.cs

       The -pkg: option instructs the compiler to fetch the definitions for gtk-
       sharp-2.0 from pkg-config, this is equivalent to passing to the  C#  com&#8208;
       piler the output of:

            $ pkg-config --libs gtk-sharp-2.0

       Usually this merely references the libraries from PACKAGEBASE/PKG.

       Although  there  are  directory names for 3.0 and 3.5, that does not mean
       that there are 3.0 and 3.5 compiler editions  or  profiles.    Those  are
       merely  new  libraries  that  must be manually referenced either with the
       proper -pkg: invocation, or by referencing the libraries directly.

SPECIAL DEFINES
       The TRACE and DEBUG defines have a special meaning to the compiler.

       By default  calls  to  methods  and  properties  in  the  System.Diagnos&#8208;
       tics.Trace  class  are  not  generated unless the TRACE symbol is defined
       (either through a &quot;#define TRACE&quot;) in your source code, or by  using  the
       --define TRACE in the command line.

       By  default  calls  to  methods  and  properties  in  the System.Diagnos&#8208;
       tics.Debug class are not generated unless the  DEBUG  symbol  is  defined
       (either  through  a &quot;#define DEBUG&quot;) in your source code, or by using the
       --define DEBUG in the command line.

       Note that the effect of defining TRACE and DEBUG  is  a  global  setting,
       even if they are only defined in a single file.

DEBUGGING SUPPORT
       When using the &quot;-debug&quot; flag, MCS will generate a file with the extension
       .mdb that contains the debugging information for the generated  assembly.
       This file is consumed by the Mono debugger (mdb).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       MCS_COLORS
              If  this  variable is set, it contains a string in the form &quot;fore&#8208;
              ground,background&quot; that specifies which color to  use  to  display
              errors on some terminals.
&#12;              The  background  is optional and defaults to your terminal current
              background.   The possible colors for foreground are: black,  red,
              brightred, green, brightgreen, yellow, brightyellow, blue, bright&#8208;
              blue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan,  grey,  white  and
              brightwhite.

              The possible colors for background are: black, red, green, yellow,
              blue, magenta, cyan, grey and white.

              For example, you could set these variable from your shell:
                   export MCS_COLORS
                   MCS_COLORS=errors=brightwhite,red

              You can disable the built-in color scheme by setting this variable
              to &quot;disable&quot;.

NOTES
       During  compilation  the MCS compiler defines the __MonoCS__ symbol, this
       can be used by pre-processor instructions to  compile  Mono  C#  compiler
       specific  code.    Please  note  that this symbol is only to test for the
       compiler, and is not useful  to  distinguish  compilation  or  deployment
       platforms.
