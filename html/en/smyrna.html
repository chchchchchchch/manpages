NAME
       smyrna - interactive graph viewer

SYNOPSIS
       smyrna [ -v?  ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       smyrna  is  a  viewer  for  graphs  in  the DOT format.  It is especially
       designed to handle large graphs, and allows flat and topological  fisheye
       views.  It is assumed the input graph has position information associated
       with all nodes. Using the Graphviz convention, a node&apos;s position is given
       by  its  pos  attribute consisting of 2 or 3 floating point numbers sepa&#8208;
       rated by commas.  Nodes are drawn as points and edges as line segments.

       If smyrna detects that the file contains xdot  attributes,  it  will  use
       this information when drawing nodes and edges.

       smyrna supports panning and zooming; node and edge selection; setting and
       retrieving node and edge attributes, especially colors;  and  node  move&#8208;
       ment.   The  Smyrna  Settings dialogue box available under the Edit pull-
       down menu gives the user many choices for tailoring the graph view. These
       include  whether or not nodes/edges are drawn; what labels are associated
       with nodes/edges;  node  size;  transparency  settings  for  nodes/edges;
       parameters associated with the topological fisheye view.

       For  the purposes of exploratory data analysis, smyrna provides access to
       the gvpr library. This allows the user to arbitrarily  query,  filter  or
       manipulate  a graph. When filtering or manipulating a graph, the user has
       the option of performing the changes directly on the input graph,  or  to
       create a new version with the changes.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -?     Print usage information.

       By default, gc returns the number of nodes and edges.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       file    Name  of file containing a graph in DOT format.  If no file oper&#8208;
               and is specified, the user can employ the File pull-down menu  to
               select a file to be opened.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0   Successful completion.

       1   If  no  No appropriate OpenGL-capable visual found, or if the default
           attributes template graph file or the default attributes widget graph
           file could not be read.

FILES
       smyrna  relies  on numerous support files. These are usually installed in
       the &quot;share/graphviz/smyrna&quot; directory below the  installation  root.  The
       principal files are:

       template.dot
              A  file  in DOT format specifying the default smyrna settings.  In
              particular, these are used  to  initialize  the  settings  of  the
              Smyrna Settings dialogue box.

       mouse_actions.txt
              A  text file specifying the mapping of concrete mouse and keyboard
              events with smyrna actions such as panning and selecting.

       attr_widgets.dot
              A file in DOT format specifying the bindings between  GUI  widgets
              and smyrna parameters.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SMYRNA_PATH
              allows  a user to override the built-in path to the directory con&#8208;
              taining all of smyrna&apos;s files described above.
