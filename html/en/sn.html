Mono(sn)                                                                Mono(sn)



NAME
       sn - Digitally sign/verify/compare strongnames on CLR assemblies.

SYNOPSIS
       sn [-q | -quiet] [options] [parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       Digitally sign, verify or compare CLR assemblies using strongnames.

       You  can  use  the  sn  command to create &quot;snk files&quot; using the -k option
       described below.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       Configuration options are stored in the machine.config configuration file
       under /configuration/strongNames.

       -c provider
              Change  the  default  CSP (Crypto Service Provider). Currently not
              supported in Mono.

       -m [y|n]
              Use a machine [y] key container or a user [n] key container.  Cur&#8208;
              rently not supported in Mono.

       -Vl    List  the verification options. The list is kept under /configura&#8208;
              tion/ strongNames/verificationSettings in machine.config.

       -Vr assembly [userlist]
              Exempt the specified assembly from verification for the  specified
              user   list.   Currently  not  supported  by  sn.  You  must  edit
              machine.config manually if you require this.

       -Vu assembly
              Remove the exemption entry for the specified  assembly.  Currently
              not  supported by sn, you must edit machine.config manually if you
              require this.

       -Vx    Remove all exemptions entries. Currently not supported by sn,  you
              must edit machine.config manually if you require this.

CSP RELATED OPTIONS
       -d container
              Delete the keypair present in the specified key container.

       -i keypair.snk container
              Import the specified strongname file into the specified container.

       -pc container publickey
              Export  the  public  key  from  the specified CSP container to the
              specified file.

CONVERSION OPTIONS
       -e assembly output.pub
              Export the assembly public key to the specified output file.

       -p keypair.snk output.pub
              Export the public key from the specified strongname key file (SNK)
              or  from  a  PKCS#12/PFX  password protected file to the specified
              output file.

       -o input output.txt
              Convert the input file to a CSV file (using decimal).
&#12;       -oh input output.txt
              Convert the input file to a CSV file (using hexadecimal).

STRONGNAME SIGNING OPTIONS
       -D assembly1 assembly2
              Compare if assembly1 and assembly are the same exception for their
              signature.   This is done by comparing the hash of the metadata of
              both assembly.

       -k [size] keypair.snk
              Create a new strongname keypair in the specified file. The default
              key  length  is 1024 bits and MUST ALWAYS be used when signing 1.x
              assemblies.  Any value from 384 to 16384 bits (in increments of  8
              bits) is a valid key length to sign 2.x assemblies. To ensure max&#8208;
              imum compatibility you may want to continue using 1024 bits  keys.
              Note  that  there&apos;s  no good reason, even if it&apos;s possible, to use
              length lesser than 1024 bits.

       -R assembly keypair.snk
              Re-sign the specified assembly using the specified strongname key&#8208;
              pair  file (SNK) or a PKCS#12/PFX password protected file. You can
              only sign an assembly with the private key that match  the  public
              key  inside  the  assembly  (unless it&apos;s public key token has been
              remapped in machine.config).

       -Rc assembly container
              Re-sign the specified assembly using the specified strongname con&#8208;
              tainer.

       -t file
              Show the public key token from the specified file.

       -tp file
              Show  the  public  key and the public key token from the specified
              file.

       -T assembly
              Show the public key token from the specified assembly.

       -Tp assembly
              Show the public key and the public key token  from  the  specified
              assembly.

       -v assembly
              Verify the specified assembly signature.

       -vf assembly
              Verify the specified assembly signature (even if disabled).

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Strongnames configuration is kept in &quot;machine.config&quot; file. Currently two
              features can be configured.
&#12;       /configuration/strongNames/pubTokenMapping
              This mechanism lets Mono remap a public key token, like  the  ECMA
              token,  to  another public key for verification. This is useful in
              two scenarios. First, assemblies signed with the &quot;ECMA  key&quot;  need
              to  be verified by the &quot;runtime&quot; key (as the ECMA key isn&apos;t a pub&#8208;
              lic key). Second, many assemblies are  signed  with  private  keys
              that  Mono  can&apos;t  use (e.g. System.Security.dll assembly).  A new
              key cannot be used because it should change thr strongname (a  new
              key  pair  would  have  a new public key which would produce a new
              token). Public key token remapping is the solution for both  prob&#8208;
              lems.  Each  token  must be configured in a &quot;map&quot; entry similar to
              this one: &lt;map Token=&quot;b77a5c561934e089&quot; PublicKey=&quot;00...&quot; /&gt;

       /configuration/strongNames/verificationSettings
              It is often useful during development to use delay  signed  assem&#8208;
              blies.   Normally*  the runtime wouldn&apos;t allow delay-signed assem&#8208;
              blies to be loaded.  This feature allows some delay-signed  assem&#8208;
              blies  (based  on their public key token, optionally assembly name
              and user name) to be used like they were fully signed  assemblies.
              [*]  Note that Mono 1.0 &quot;runtime&quot; doesn&apos;t validate strongname sig&#8208;
              natures so this option shouldn&apos;t be required in most scenarios.
