SNMP_CONFIG(5snmp)                  Net-SNMP                  SNMP_CONFIG(5snmp)



NAME
       snmp_config - handling of Net-SNMP configuration files

DESCRIPTION
       The  Net-SNMP  package  uses various configuration files to configure its
       applications.  This manual page merely describes the  overall  nature  of
       them, so that the other manual pages don&apos;t have to.

DIRECTORIES SEARCHED
       First  off,  there  are  numerous  places that configuration files can be
       found and read from.  By default, the applications look for configuration
       files   in   the   following   4   directories,   in   order:  /etc/snmp,
       /usr/share/snmp, /usr/lib/snmp, and $HOME/.snmp.  In each of these direc&#8208;
       tories, it looks for files with the extension of both conf and local.conf
       (reading the second ones last).  In this  manner,  there  are  8  default
       places  a  configuration  file can exist for any given configuration file
       type.

       Additionally, the above default search path can be overridden by  setting
       the environment variable SNMPCONFPATH to a colon-separated list of direc&#8208;
       tories to search for.   The  path  for  the  persistent  data  should  be
       included  when  running applications that use persistent storage, such as
       snmpd.

       Applications will read persistent configuration files  in  the  following
       order of preference:

              file in SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE environment variable

              directories in SNMPCONFPATH environment variable

              directory defined by persistentDir snmp.conf variable

              directory in SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR environment variable

              default /var/lib/snmp directory

       Finally,  applications  will  write persistent configuration files in the
       following order of preference:

              file in SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE environment variable

              directory defined by persistentDir snmp.conf variable

              directory in SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR environment variable

              default /var/lib/snmp directory

       Note:  When using SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE, the  filename  should  match  the
       application name.  For example, /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf.

CONFIGURATION FILE TYPES
       Each application may use multiple configuration files, which will config&#8208;
       ure various different aspects of the application.  For instance, the SNMP
       agent  (snmpd)  knows  how to understand configuration directives in both
       the snmpd.conf and the  snmp.conf  files.   In  fact,  most  applications
       understand  how  to read the contents of the snmp.conf files.  Note, how&#8208;
       ever, that configuration directives understood in one  file  may  not  be
       understood in another file.  For further information, read the associated
       manual page with each configuration file type.  Also, most of the  appli&#8208;
       cations  support  a -H switch on the command line that will list the con&#8208;
       figuration files it will look for and the directives in each one that  it
       understands.

       The  snmp.conf  configuration  file is intended to be a application suite
       wide configuration file that supports directives that are useful for con&#8208;
       trolling  the fundamental nature of all of the SNMP applications, such as
       how they all manipulate and parse the textual SNMP MIB files.

SWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE
       It&apos;s possible to switch in  mid-file  the  configuration  type  that  the
       parser  is supposed to be reading.  Since that sentence doesn&apos;t make much
       sense, lets give you an example: say that you wanted to  turn  on  packet
       dumping  output  for the agent by default, but you didn&apos;t want to do that
       for the rest of the applications (ie, snmpget, snmpwalk, ...).   Normally
       to  enable  packet  dumping in the configuration file you&apos;d need to put a
       line like:

              dumpPacket true

       into the snmp.conf file.  But, this would turn  it  on  for  all  of  the
       applications.   So,  instead, you can put the same line in the snmpd.conf
       file so that it only applies to the snmpd daemon.  However, you  need  to
       tell  the  parser  to expect this line.  You do this by putting a special
       type specification token inside a [] set.  In other  words,  inside  your
       snmpd.conf  file  you could put the above snmp.conf directive by adding a
       line like so:

              [snmp] dumpPacket true

       This tells the parser to parse the above line as  if  it  were  inside  a
       snmp.conf  file  instead  of  an snmpd.conf file.  If you want to parse a
       bunch of lines rather than just one then you can make the context  switch
       apply  to  the  remainder  of  the  file or until the next context switch
       directive by putting the special token on a line by itself:

              # make this file handle snmp.conf tokens:
              [snmp]
              dumpPacket true
              logTimestamp true
              # return to our original snmpd.conf tokens:
              [snmpd]
              rocommunity mypublic

COMMENTS
       Any lines beginning with the character &apos;#&apos; in the configuration files are
       treated as a comment and are not parsed.

API INTERFACE
       Information  about writing C code that makes use of this system in either
       the agent&apos;s MIB modules or in applications can be found in the  read_con&#8208;
       fig(3) manual page.
