SNMPD.INTERNAL(5snmp)               Net-SNMP               SNMPD.INTERNAL(5snmp)



NAME
       snmpd.internal - internal configuration of the Net-SNMP agent

DESCRIPTION
       The  snmpd.conf(5)  man page defines the syntax and behaviour of the main
       configuration directives that can be used to control the operation of the
       Net-SNMP agent, and the management information it provides.

       However  there are several other configuration directives (many of which,
       though not all, start with a leading underscore) that are  recognised  by
       the agent.  These are typically used to retain configuration across agent
       restarts, and are not intended for direct user  access.   This  man  page
       list  these directives, giving a brief indication of where they are used.
       For full details - see the relevant source files.  If  you  can&apos;t  follow
       that source, you probably shouldn&apos;t be fiddling with these directives!

AGENT BEHAVIOUR
       quit

ACCESS CONTROL
   VACM Configuration
       vacmView / vacmGroup / vacmAccess
              These  directives are used to retain dynamically configured access
              control settings.

SYSTEM INFORMATION
   System Group
       setSerialNo
              This directive is used  to  implement  the  advisory  lock  object
              snmpSetSerialNo.

       psyslocation / psyscontact / psysname
              These  directives are used to retain dynamically configured system
              settings.  They will be overridden by the  corresponding  sysLoca&#8208;
              tion, sysContact and sysName directives.

ACTIVE MONITORING
   Notification Handling
       pauthtrapenable
              This  directive  is used to retain the dynamically configured set&#8208;
              ting of whether the agent  should  generate  authenticationFailure
              traps.   It will be overridden by the corresponding authtrapenable
              directive.

       snmpNotify*Table

       targetAddr / targetParams
              These directives are used to retain dynamically configured notifi&#8208;
              cation destination settings.

   DisMan Event MIB
       _mteE*Table, _mteOTable, _mteT*Table
              These  directives are used to retain dynamically configured event,
              object and monitor trigger settings.

       mteObjectsTable / mteTriggerTable
              These directives are for  compatibility  with  the  previous  dis&#8208;
              man/event-mib implementation.

   DisMan Schedule MIB
       _schedTable
              This  directive is used to retain dynamically configured scheduled
              events.

EXTENDING AGENT FUNCTIONALITY
   Arbitrary Extension Commands
       extend-sh

       exec2 / sh2 / execFix2
              These directives were defined by analogy  with  equivalent  direc&#8208;
              tives  in  the  previous ucd-snmp/extensible implementation.  They
              are deprecated, and should not be used.
