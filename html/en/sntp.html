SNTP(1)                        Programmer&apos;s Manual                       SNTP(1)



NAME
       sntp - standard Simple Network Time Protocol program

SYNOPSIS
       sntp [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...
               [ hostname-or-IP ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the sntp command.  sntp can be used as
       a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display  the  time
       or set the local system&apos;s time (given suitable privilege).  It can be run
       as an interactive command or in a cron job.

       NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time  Proto&#8208;
       col) are defined and described by RFC 5905.


       The  default  is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e.
       not UTC) to the standard output in a format like &apos;1996-10-15 20:17:25.123
       (+0800)  +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs&apos;, where the &apos;(+0800)&apos; means that to get to
       UTC from the reported local time one must add 8 hours and 0 minutes,  and
       the  &apos;+4.567  +/-  0.089 secs&apos; indicates the local clock is 4.567 seconds
       behind the correct time (so 4.567 seconds must  be  added  to  the  local
       clock to get it to be correct), and the time of &apos;1996-10-15 20:17:25.123&apos;
       is believed to be correct to within +/- 0.089 seconds.

OPTIONS
       -4, --ipv4
              Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.  This option must  not  appear  in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv6.

              Force  DNS  resolution  of the following host names on the command
              line to the IPv4 namespace.

       -6, --ipv6
              Force IPv6 DNS name resolution.  This option must  not  appear  in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv4.

              Force  DNS  resolution  of the following host names on the command
              line to the IPv6 namespace.

       -d, --normalverbose
              Normal verbose.

              Diagnostic messages for non-fatal errors and a limited  amount  of
              tracing  should  be  written to standard error.  Fatal ones always
              produce a diagnostic.  This option should be set when there  is  a
              suspected problem with the server, network or the source.

       -K file-name, --kod=file-name
              KoD history filename.

              Specifies  the  filename  to be used to persist the history of KoD
              responses received from servers.  The default is /var/db/ntp-kod.

       -p, --syslog
              Logging with syslog.  This option must not appear  in  combination
              with any of the following options: logfile.

              When this option is set all logging will be done using syslog.

       -l file-name, --logfile=file-name
              Log to specified logfile.  This option must not appear in combina&#8208;
              tion with any of the following options: syslog.

              This option causes the client to write log messages to the  speci&#8208;
              fied logfile.

       -s, --settod
              Set  (step)  the  time  with settimeofday().  This option must not
              appear in combination with any of the following options: adjtime.



       -j, --adjtime
              Set (slew) the time with adjtime().  This option must  not  appear
              in combination with any of the following options: settod.



       -b broadcast-address, --broadcast=broadcast-address
              Use broadcasts to the address specified for synchronisation.

              If  specified  SNTP will listen to the specified broadcast address
              for NTP broadcasts.  The default maximum wait  time,  68  seconds,
              can be modified with -t.

       -t seconds, --timeout=seconds
              Specify the number of seconds to wait for broadcasts.  This option
              takes an integer number as its argument.  The default seconds  for
              this option is:
                   68

              When  waiting  for a broadcast packet SNTP will wait the number of
              seconds specified before giving up.  Default 68 seconds.

       -a auth-keynumber, --authentication=auth-keynumber
              Enable authentication with the key  auth-keynumber.   This  option
              takes an integer number as its argument.

              This option enables authentication using the key specified in this
              option&apos;s argument.  The argument of this option is  the  keyid,  a
              number  specified in the keyfile as this key&apos;s identifier. See the
              keyfile option (-k) for more details.

       -k file-name, --keyfile=file-name
              Specify a keyfile. SNTP will look in this file for the key  speci&#8208;
              fied with -a.

              This  option  specifies  the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key
              specified with -a keyno in this file. Key files follow the follow&#8208;
              ing format:

              keyid keytype key

              Where     keyid is a number identifying this key keytype is one of
              the follow: S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in in
              the  DES  specification.   N   Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as
              specified in the NTP standard.  A  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII
              string.   M   Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string using the MD5
              authentication scheme.

              For more information see ntp.keys(5).

       -?, --help
              Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       -&gt; [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
              Save the option state to rcfile.  The default is the last configu&#8208;
              ration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       -&lt; rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
              Load  options from rcfile.  The no-load-opts form will disable the
              loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is handled early,
              out of order.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
              Output  version  of  program and exit.  The default mode is `v&apos;, a
              simple version.  The `c&apos; mode will print copyright information and
              `n&apos; will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by loading
       values from configuration (&quot;RC&quot; or &quot;.INI&quot;) file(s) and values from  envi&#8208;
       ronment variables named:
         SNTP_&lt;option-name&gt; or SNTP
       The  environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than) the
       configuration files.  The homerc files are &quot;$HOME&quot;, and &quot;.&quot;.  If  any  of
       these  are directories, then the file .ntprc is searched for within those
       directories.

USAGE
       The simplest use of this program is as an unprivileged command  to  check
       the current time and error in the local clock.  For example:

              sntp ntpserver.somewhere

       With  suitable  privilege, it can be run as a command or in a cron job to
       reset the local clock from a reliable server, like the ntpdate and  rdate
       commands.  For example:

              sntp -a ntpserver.somewhere

RETURN VALUE
       The  program  returns  a zero exit status for success, and a non-zero one
       otherwise.
