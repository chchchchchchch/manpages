NAME
       soapsuds - Mono&apos;s Remoting Proxy Generator

SYNOPSIS
       soapsuds [options] [inputs] [outputs]

DESCRIPTION
       soapsuds  is  a tool for generating WSDL documents and client proxies for
       remoting services.  A WSDL document describes the methods that a  service
       provides  together  with XML schemas of all referenced data structures. A
       client proxy is a class which offers the same methods as the  service  it
       represents, but provides no implementation, it just forwards calls to the
       remote service.

       Generated client proxies are not strictly necessary,  since  the  runtime
       can  automatically generate proxies from the original service types. How&#8208;
       ever, it implies the need  of  distributing  the  service  class  to  all
       clients. In some scenarios a better approach is to use soapsuds to gener&#8208;
       ate a proxy class which has the same interface as the service, but  with&#8208;
       out any implementation.

       soapsuds  can generate a WSDL document from a set of types specified with
       the option -types or can extract the types  from  an  assembly  specified
       with  -inputassemblyfile.   In  this  last  case,  soapsuds  will include
       schemas for all serializable classes in the WSDL document.

       Taking as input a WSDL document (or anything from which such document can
       be  generated)  the  tool  can  generate source code for the client proxy
       (using the -gc option) or it  can  directly  generate  an  assembly  that
       implements the proxy (with the -outputassemblyfile option). soapsuds will
       also generate fake serializable classes for  all  types  defined  in  the
       schema. However, beware that those classes will lack the semantics of the
       original classes, since only data structure is generated.

INPUT SOURCES
       The following sources are available (only one can be specified):

       -urltoschema:url -url:url
              Url from which to retrieve the WSDL document.

       -types:type1,assembly[,serviceEndPoint][;type2,assembly[,serviceEnd&#8208;
       Point]]...
              Specifies  types  for  which  to generate a schema or proxy. If no
              service endpoint is provided, the  one  provided  with  the  -ser&#8208;
              viceendpoint option is used.

       -inputassemblyfile:file , -ia:file
              Assembly that contains the types to export.

       -inputschemafile:schena , -is:schema
              Schema from which to generate proxy classes.

INPUT OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -inputdirectory:directory , -id:directory
              Directory where DLLs are located.

       -serviceendpoint:url , -se:url
              Url of the service to be placed in the WSDL document.

OUTPUTS
       The  following  output options are available (more than one can be speci&#8208;
       fied):

       -outputassemblyfile:file , -oa:file
              Generates the proxy code and compiles it into an assembly with the
              provided name.

       -outputschemafile:file , -os:file
              Generates a WSDL document that represents the provided types.

       -generatecode , -gc
              Generates  proxy  source  code  for  the provided WSDL document or
              types.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -outputdirectory:directory , -od:directory
              Directory where generated files will be placed.

       -proxynamespace:namespace , -pn:namespace
              Namespace of the generated proxy.

       -nowrappedproxy , -nowp
              Do not generate a wrapped proxy.

       -wrappedproxy , -wp
              Generate a wrapped proxy.

       -strongnamefile:file , -sn:file
              Strong name file.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -nologo
              Supress the startup logo.

       -u:username , -user:username
              The user name to use when connecting to the server.

       -p:password , -password:password
              The password to use when connecting to the server.

       -d:domain , -domain:domain
              The domain to use when connecting to the server.

       -httpproxyname:name , -hpn:name
              Name of the http proxy.

       -httpproxyport:port , -hpp:port
              Port of the http proxy.
