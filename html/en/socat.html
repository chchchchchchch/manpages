NAME
       socat - Multipurpose relay (SOcket CAT)

SYNOPSIS
       socat [options] &lt;address&gt; &lt;address&gt;
       socat -V
       socat -h[h[h]] | -?[?[?]]
       filan
       procan

DESCRIPTION
       Socat  is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional
       byte streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can  be
       constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources
       (see address types), and because lots of address options may  be  applied
       to the streams, socat can be used for many different purposes.

       Filan is a utility that prints information about its active file descrip&#8208;
       tors to stdout. It has been written for debugging  socat,  but  might  be
       useful for other purposes too. Use the -h option to find more infos.

       Procan  is  a utility that prints information about process parameters to
       stdout. It has been written to better understand some UNIX process  prop&#8208;
       erties  and  for  debugging socat, but might be useful for other purposes
       too.

       The life cycle of a socat instance typically consists of four phases.

       In the init phase, the command line options are  parsed  and  logging  is
       initialized.

       During  the  open phase, socat opens the first address and afterwards the
       second address. These steps are usually blocking;  thus,  especially  for
       complex  address  types like socks, connection requests or authentication
       dialogs must be completed before the next step is started.

       In the transfer phase, socat watches both streams&apos; read  and  write  file
       descriptors  via  select()  , and, when data is available on one side and
       can be written to the other side, socat reads it, performs newline  char&#8208;
       acter  conversions  if  required,  and  writes the data to the write file
       descriptor of the other stream, then continues waiting for more  data  in
       both directions.

       When  one  of  the  streams  effectively  reaches  EOF, the closing phase
       begins. Socat transfers the EOF condition to the other stream, i.e. tries
       to shutdown only its write stream, giving it a chance to terminate grace&#8208;
       fully. For a defined time socat continues to transfer data in  the  other
       direction, but then closes all remaining channels and terminates.

OPTIONS
       Socat provides some command line options that modify the behaviour of the
       program. They have nothing to do with so called address options that  are
       used as parts of address specifications.

       -V     Print  version  and  available  feature information to stdout, and
              exit.

       -h | -?
              Print a help text to stdout describing command  line  options  and
              available address types, and exit.

       -hh | -??
              Like  -h,  plus a list of the short names of all available address
              options. Some options are platform dependend, so  this  output  is
              helpful for checking the particular implementation.

       -hhh | -???
              Like -hh, plus a list of all available address option names.

       -d     Without  this option, only fatal and error messages are generated;
              applying this option also prints warning messages. See DIAGNOSTICS
              for more information.

       -d -d  Prints fatal, error, warning, and notice messages.

       -d -d -d
              Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, and info messages.

       -d -d -d -d
              Prints fatal, error, warning, notice, info, and debug messages.

       -D     Logs information about file descriptors before starting the trans&#8208;
              fer phase.

       -ly[&lt;facility&gt;]
              Writes messages to syslog instead of stderr; severity  as  defined
              with  -d  option. With optional &lt;facility&gt;, the syslog type can be
              selected, default is &quot;daemon&quot;.

       -lf&lt;logfile&gt;
              Writes messages to &lt;logfile&gt; [filename] instead of stderr.

       -ls    Writes messages to stderr (this is the default).

       -lp&lt;progname&gt;
              Overrides the program name printed in error messages and used  for
              constructing environment variable names.

       -lu    Extends the timestamp of error messages to microsecond resolution.
              Does not work when logging to syslog.

       -lm[&lt;facility&gt;]
              Mixed log mode. During startup messages  are  printed  to  stderr;
              when  socat  starts  the  transfer phase loop or daemon mode (i.e.
              after opening all streams and before starting data  transfer,  or,
              with  listening  sockets with fork option, before the first accept
              call), it switches logging to syslog.  With  optional  &lt;facility&gt;,
              the syslog type can be selected, default is &quot;daemon&quot;.

       -lh    Adds  hostname  to  log  messages. Uses the value from environment
              variable HOSTNAME or the value retrieved with uname() if  HOSTNAME
              is not set.

       -v     Writes  the transferred data not only to their target streams, but
              also to stderr. The output format is text  with  some  conversions
              for  readability,  and  prefixed with &quot;&gt; &quot; or &quot;&lt; &quot; indicating flow
              directions.

       -x     Writes the transferred data not only to their target streams,  but
              also to stderr. The output format is hexadecimal, prefixed with &quot;&gt;
              &quot; or &quot;&lt; &quot; indicating flow directions. Can be combined with -v .

       -b&lt;size&gt;
              Sets the data transfer block  &lt;size&gt;  [size_t].   At  most  &lt;size&gt;
              bytes are transferred per step. Default is 8192 bytes.

       -s     By default, socat terminates when an error occurred to prevent the
              process from running when some option could not be  applied.  With
              this  option,  socat  is sloppy with errors and tries to continue.
              Even with this option, socat will exit on fatals, and  will  abort
              connection attempts when security checks failed.
&#12;       -t&lt;timeout&gt;
              When  one  channel  has  reached  EOF, the write part of the other
              channel is shut down. Then, socat waits &lt;timeout&gt;  [timeval]  sec&#8208;
              onds before terminating. Default is 0.5 seconds. This timeout only
              applies to addresses where write and read part can be closed inde&#8208;
              pendently.  When  during  the timeout interval the read part gives
              EOF, socat terminates without awaiting the timeout.

       -T&lt;timeout&gt;
              Total inactivity timeout: when socat is already  in  the  transfer
              loop  and nothing has happened for &lt;timeout&gt; [timeval] seconds (no
              data arrived, no interrupt occurred...) then it terminates.   Use&#8208;
              ful with protocols like UDP that cannot transfer EOF.

       -u     Uses unidirectional mode. The first address is only used for read&#8208;
              ing, and the second address is only used for writing (example).

       -U     Uses unidirectional mode in reverse direction. The  first  address
              is  only used for writing, and the second address is only used for
              reading.

       -g     During address option parsing, don&apos;t check if the option  is  con&#8208;
              sidered  useful  in  the  given address environment. Use it if you
              want to force, e.g., appliance of a  socket  option  to  a  serial
              device.

       -L&lt;lockfile&gt;
              If  lockfile exists, exits with error. If lockfile does not exist,
              creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.

       -W&lt;lockfile&gt;
              If lockfile exists, waits until it disappears. When lockfile  does
              not exist, creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.

       -4     Use  IP  version 4 in case that the addresses do not implicitly or
              explicitly specify a version; this is the default.

       -6     Use IP version 6 in case that the addresses do not  implicitly  or
              explicitly specify a version.


ADDRESS SPECIFICATIONS
       With  the  address  command line arguments, the user gives socat instruc&#8208;
       tions and the necessary information for establishing the byte streams.

       An address specification usually consists of  an  address  type  keyword,
       zero  or  more required address parameters separated by &apos;:&apos; from the key&#8208;
       word and from each other, and zero or more address options  separated  by
       &apos;,&apos;.

       The keyword specifies the address type (e.g., TCP4, OPEN, EXEC). For some
       keywords there exist synonyms (&apos;-&apos; for STDIO, TCP for TCP4). Keywords are
       case  insensitive.   For  a few special address types, the keyword may be
       omitted: Address specifications starting with a number are assumed to  be
       FD  (raw  file  descriptor) addresses; if a &apos;/&apos; is found before the first
       &apos;:&apos; or &apos;,&apos;, GOPEN (generic file open) is assumed.

       The required number and type of address parameters depend on the  address
       type. E.g., TCP4 requires a server specification (name or address), and a
       port specification (number or service name).

       Zero or more address options may be given with each address. They  influ&#8208;
       ence  the  address in some ways.  Options consist of an option keyword or
       an option keyword and a value, separated by &apos;=&apos;. Option keywords are case
       insensitive.   For  filtering the options that are useful with an address
       type, each option is member of one option group. For  each  address  type
       there is a set of option groups allowed. Only options belonging to one of
       these address groups may be used (except with option -g).

       Address specifications following the above schema are also called  single
       address  specifications.   Two single addresses can be combined with &quot;!!&quot;
       to form a dual type address for one channel. Here, the first  address  is
       used  by socat for reading data, and the second address for writing data.
       There is no way to specify an option only once for being applied to  both
       single addresses.

       Usually, addresses are opened in read/write mode. When an address is part
       of a dual address specification, or when option -u  or  -U  is  used,  an
       address  might  be used only for reading or for writing. Considering this
       is important with some address types.

       With socat version 1.5.0 and higher, the lexical analysis tries to handle
       quotes  and parenthesis meaningfully and allows escaping of special char&#8208;
       acters.  If one of the characters ( { [ &apos;  is  found,  the  corresponding
       closing  character  -  )  } ] &apos; - is looked for; they may also be nested.
       Within these constructs, socats special characters and strings : , !! are
       not  handled  specially.  All those characters and strings can be escaped
       with \ or within &quot;&quot;

ADDRESS TYPES
       This section describes the available address types with  their  keywords,
       parameters, and semantics.

       CREATE:&lt;filename&gt;
              Opens  &lt;filename&gt;  with  creat()  and uses the file descriptor for
              writing.  This address type requires write-only context, because a
              file  opened with creat cannot be read from.  &lt;filename&gt; must be a
              valid existing or not existing path.  If  &lt;filename&gt;  is  a  named
              pipe,  creat() might block; if &lt;filename&gt; refers to a socket, this
              is an error.
              Option groups: FD,REG,NAMED
              Useful options:  mode,  user,  group,  unlink-early,  unlink-late,
              append
              See also: OPEN, GOPEN

       EXEC:&lt;command-line&gt;
              Forks a sub process that establishes communication with its parent
              process and invokes the specified program with execvp()  .   &lt;com&#8208;
              mand-line&gt;  is a simple command with arguments separated by single
              spaces. If the program name contains a &apos;/&apos;,  the  part  after  the
              last  &apos;/&apos;  is  taken as ARGV[0]. If the program name is a relative
              path, the execvp() semantics for finding  the  program  via  $PATH
              apply.  After successful program start, socat writes data to stdin
              of the process and reads from  its  stdout  using  a  UNIX  domain
              socket generated by socketpair() per default. (example)
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,EXEC,FORK,TERMIOS
              Useful  options: path, fdin, fdout, chroot, su, su-d, nofork, pty,
              stderr, ctty, setsid, pipes, login, sigint, sigquit
              See also: SYSTEM

       FD:&lt;fdnum&gt;
              Uses the file descriptor &lt;fdnum&gt;. It must already exist  as  valid
              UN*X file descriptor.
              Option groups: FD (TERMIOS,REG,SOCKET)
              See also: STDIO, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR

       GOPEN:&lt;filename&gt;
              (Generic  open)  This address type tries to handle any file system
              entry except directories usefully. &lt;filename&gt; may be a relative or
              absolute path. If it already exists, its type is checked.  In case
              of a UNIX domain socket,  socat  connects;  if  connecting  fails,
              socat  assumes  a datagram socket and uses sendto() calls.  If the
              entry is not a socket, socat opens it applying the O_APPEND  flag.
              If  it does not exist, it is opened with flag O_CREAT as a regular
              file (example).
              Option groups: FD,REG,SOCKET,NAMED,OPEN
              See also: OPEN, CREATE, UNIX-CONNECT

       IP-SENDTO:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Opens a raw IP socket. Depending on host specification  or  option
              pf, IP procotol version 4 or 6 is used. It uses &lt;protocol&gt; to send
              packets to &lt;host&gt; [IP address] and  receives  packets  from  host,
              ignores  packets  from  other  hosts.   Protocol  255 uses the raw
              socket with the IP header being part of the data.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,IP6
              Useful options: pf, ttl
              See  also:  IP4-SENDTO,  IP6-SENDTO,  IP-RECVFROM,  IP-RECV,  UDP-
              SENDTO, UNIX-SENDTO

       INTERFACE:&lt;interface&gt;
              Communicates  with  a  network connected on an interface using raw
              packets including link level data. &lt;interface&gt; is the name of  the
              network  interface.  Currently  only  available  on Linux.  Option
              groups: FD,SOCKET
              Useful options: pf, type
              See also: ip-recv

       IP4-SENDTO:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-SENDTO, but always uses IPv4.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4

       IP6-SENDTO:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-SENDTO, but always uses IPv6.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP6


       IP-DATAGRAM:&lt;address&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Sends outgoing data to the specified address which may in particu&#8208;
              lar  be  a broadcast or multicast address. Packets arriving on the
              local socket are checked if their source addresses match RANGE  or
              TCPWRAP  options.  This  address  type can for example be used for
              implementing symmetric or asymmetric broadcast or multicast commu&#8208;
              nications.
              Option groups: FD, SOCKET, IP4, IP6, RANGE
              Useful  options:  bind,  range,  tcpwrap, broadcast, ip-multicast-
              loop, ip-multicast-ttl, ip-multicast-if,  ip-add-membership,  ttl,
              tos, pf
              See  also: IP4-DATAGRAM, IP6-DATAGRAM, IP-SENDTO, IP-RECVFROM, IP-
              RECV, UDP-DATAGRAM

       IP4-DATAGRAM:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-DATAGRAM, but always uses IPv4.  (example)
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,RANGE

       IP6-DATAGRAM:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-DATAGRAM, but always uses IPv6. Please note that IPv6 does
              not know broadcasts.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP6,RANGE


       IP-RECVFROM:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Opens  a  raw  IP socket of &lt;protocol&gt;. Depending on option pf, IP
              procotol version 4 or 6 is used. It receives one  packet  from  an
              unspecified  peer  and may send one or more answer packets to that
              peer.  This mode is particularly useful  with  fork  option  where
              each  arriving  packet  - from arbitrary peers - is handled by its
              own sub process.  This allows a behaviour similar to  typical  UDP
              based servers like ntpd or named.
              Please  note  that  the reply packets might be fetched as incoming
              traffic when sender and receiver IP address are identical  because
              there is no port number to distinguish the sockets.
              This  address works well with IP-SENDTO address peers (see above).
              Protocol 255 uses the raw socket with the IP header being part  of
              the data.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,IP6,CHILD,RANGE
              Useful options: pf, fork, range, ttl, broadcast
              See  also:  IP4-RECVFROM,  IP6-RECVFROM,  IP-SENDTO, IP-RECV, UDP-
              RECVFROM, UNIX-RECVFROM

       IP4-RECVFROM:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-RECVFROM, but always uses IPv4.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,CHILD,RANGE

       IP6-RECVFROM:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-RECVFROM, but always uses IPv6.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP6,CHILD,RANGE


       IP-RECV:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Opens a raw IP socket of &lt;protocol&gt;. Depending on  option  pf,  IP
              procotol version 4 or 6 is used. It receives packets from multiple
              unspecified peers and merges the data.  No replies  are  possible.
              It can be, e.g., addressed by socat IP-SENDTO address peers.  Pro&#8208;
              tocol 255 uses the raw socket with the IP header being part of the
              data.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,IP6,RANGE
              Useful options: pf, range
              See  also:  IP4-RECV,  IP6-RECV, IP-SENDTO, IP-RECVFROM, UDP-RECV,
              UNIX-RECV

       IP4-RECV:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-RECV, but always uses IPv4.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP4,RANGE

       IP6-RECV:&lt;protocol&gt;
              Like IP-RECV, but always uses IPv6.
              Option groups: FD,SOCKET,IP6,RANGE


       OPEN:&lt;filename&gt;
              Opens &lt;filename&gt; using the open()  system  call  (example).   This
              operation fails on UNIX domain sockets.
              Note: This address type is rarly useful in bidirectional mode.
              Option groups: FD,REG,NAMED,OPEN
              Useful  options:  creat,  excl, noatime, nofollow, append, rdonly,
              wronly, lock, readbytes, ignoreeof

       OPENSSL:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              Tries to establish a SSL connection to  &lt;port&gt;  [TCP  service]  on
              &lt;host&gt;  [IP  address]  using  TCP/IP  version  4 or 6 depending on
              address specification, name resolution, or option pf.
              NOTE: The server certificate is only checked for validity  against
              cafile  or capath, but not for match with the server&apos;s name or its
              IP address!

       OPENSSL-LISTEN:&lt;port&gt;
              Listens  on  tcp &lt;port&gt; [TCP service].  The IP version is 4 or the
              one specified with pf. When a connection is accepted, this address
              behaves as SSL server.
              Note:  You  probably  want to use the certificate option with this
              address.
              NOTE: The client certificate is only checked for validity  against
              cafile  or capath, but not for match with the client&apos;s name or its

       PIPE:&lt;filename&gt;
              If &lt;filename&gt; already exists, it is opened.  If it does not exist,
              a  named  pipe is created and opened. Beginning with socat version
              1.4.3, the named pipe is removed when the address is  closed  (but
              see option unlink-close
              Note:  When  a pipe is used for both reading and writing, it works
              as echo service.
              Note: When a pipe is used for both reading and writing, and  socat
              tries  to  write  more  bytes than the pipe can buffer (Linux 2.4:
              2048 bytes), socat might block. Consider using socat option, e.g.,
              -b 2048

       PIPE   Creates  an  unnamed  pipe and uses it for reading and writing. It
              works as an echo, because everything written to it appeares  imme&#8208;
              diately as read data.
              Note: When socat tries to write more bytes than the pipe can queue
              (Linux 2.4: 2048 bytes), socat might block. Consider, e.g.,  using
              option -b 2048

              sion 4 or 6 depending on address specification,  name  resolution,
              or  option  pf,  and sends a CONNECT request for hostname:port. If
              the proxy grants access and succeeds to  connect  to  the  target,
              data  transfer  between  socat and the target can start. Note that
              the traffic need not be HTTP but can be an arbitrary protocol.

       PTY    Generates  a  pseudo  terminal  (pty)  and  uses  its master side.
              Another process may open the pty&apos;s slave  side  using  it  like  a
              serial  line  or  terminal.   (example).  If both the ptmx and the
              openpty mechanisms are available, ptmx is used (POSIX).

       UDP-DATAGRAM:&lt;address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              Sends outgoing data to the specified address which may in particu&#8208;
              lar be a broadcast or multicast address. Packets arriving  on  the
              local  socket are checked for the correct remote port and if their
              source addresses match RANGE or TCPWRAP options. This address type
              can  for  example be used for implementing symmetric or asymmetric
              broadcast or multicast communications.

       UDP-LISTEN:&lt;port&gt;
              Waits for a UDP/IP packet arriving on  &lt;port&gt;  [UDP  service]  and
              `connects&apos;  back  to  sender.  The accepted IP version is 4 or the
              one specified with option pf.  Please note that, due to UDP proto&#8208;
              col  properties,  no  real  connection is established; data has to
              arrive from the peer first, and no end-of-file  condition  can  be
              transported. Note that opening this address usually blocks until a
              client connects.

       UDP-SENDTO:&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              Communicates with the specified peer  socket,  defined  by  &lt;port&gt;
              [UDP  service] on &lt;host&gt; [IP address], using UDP/IP version 4 or 6
              depending on address specification, name resolution, or option pf.
              It  sends  packets  to  and receives packets from that peer socket
              only.  This address effectively implements a datagram client.   It
              works well with socat UDP-RECVFROM and UDP-RECV address peers.

       UDP-RECVFROM:&lt;port&gt;
              Creates a UDP socket on &lt;port&gt; [UDP service] using UDP/IP  version
              4  or  6  depending  on option pf.  It receives one packet from an
              unspecified peer and may send one or more answer packets  to  that
              peer. This mode is particularly useful with fork option where each
              arriving packet - from arbitrary peers - is handled by its own sub
              process.  This  allows  a  behaviour  similar to typical UDP based
              servers like ntpd or named. This address  works  well  with  socat
              UDP-SENDTO address peers.

              Creates a UDP socket on &lt;port&gt; [UDP service] using UDP/IP  version
              4  or 6 depending on option pf.  It receives packets from multiple
              unspecified peers and merges the data.  No replies  are  possible.
              It  works  well  with,  e.g.,  socat  UDP-SENDTO address peers; it

              Listens on &lt;filename&gt;  using  a  UNIX  domain  stream  socket  and
              accepts  a  connection.  If &lt;filename&gt; exists and is not a socket,
              this is an error.  If &lt;filename&gt;  exists  and  is  a  UNIX  domain
              socket,  binding  to the address fails (use option unlink-early!).
              Note that opening this address usually blocks until a client  con&#8208;
              nects.   Beginning with socat version 1.4.3, the file system entry
              is removed when this address is closed  (but  see  option  unlink-

              the socket address strings are prefixed with &quot;\0&quot; internally. This
              feature is available (only?) on Linux.  Option groups are the same

ADDRESS OPTIONS
       Address options can be applied to address specifications to influence the
       process of opening the addresses and the properties of the resulting data
       channels.

       For  technical  reasons  not every option can be applied to every address
       type; e.g., applying a socket option to a  regular  file  will  fail.  To
       catch  most  useless combinations as early as in the open phase, the con&#8208;
       cept of option groups was introduced. Each option belongs to one or  more
       option  groups.  Options can be used only with address types that support
       at least one of their option groups (but see option -g).

       Address options have data types that their values must conform to.  Every
       address  option  consists  of  just  a  keyword  or a keyword followed by
       &quot;=value&quot;, where value must conform to the  options  type.   Some  address
       options manipulate parameters of system calls; e.g., option sync sets the
       O_SYNC flag with the open()  call.   Other  options  cause  a  system  or
       library  call;  e.g.,  with option `ttl=value&apos; the setsockopt(fd, SOL_IP,
       IP_TTL, value, sizeof(int)) call is applied.  Other options set  internal
       socat  variables  that are used during data transfer; e.g., `crnl&apos; causes
       explicit character conversions.  A few options have more  complex  imple&#8208;
       mentations;  e.g.,  su-d (substuser-delayed) inquires some user and group
       infos, stores them, and applies them  later  after  a  possible  chroot()
       call.

       If  multiple  options  are  given  to  an  address, their sequence in the
       address specification has (almost) no effect on  the  sequence  of  their
       execution/application.  Instead, socat has built in an option phase model
       that tries to bring the options in a useful order. Some options exist  in
       different  forms (e.g., unlink, unlink-early, unlink-late) to control the
       time of their execution.

       If the same option is specified more than once within one address  speci&#8208;
       fication,  with equal or different values, the effect depends on the kind
       of option. Options resulting in function calls  like  setsockopt()  cause
       multiple  invocations.  With  options  that set parameters for a required
       call like open() or set internal flags, the  value  of  the  last  option
       occurrence is effective.

       The  existence  or  semantics of many options are system dependent. Socat
       usually does NOT try to emulate missing libc or kernel features, it  just
       provides  an interface to the underlying system. So, if an operating sys&#8208;
       tem lacks a feature, the related option is simply not available  on  this
       platform.

       The  following paragraphs introduce just the more common address options.
       For a more comprehensive reference and to find information about  canoni&#8208;
       cal  option  names,  alias  names,  option phases, and platforms see file
       xio.help.


       FD option group

       This option group contains options that are applied to a UN*X style  file
       descriptor,  no  matter  how it was generated.  Because all current socat
       address types are file descriptor based, these options may be applied  to
       any address.
       Note: Some of these options are also member of another option group, that
       provides another, non-fd based mechanism.  For these options, it  depends
       on the actual address type and its option groups which mechanism is used.
       The second, non-fd based mechanism is prioritized.

       cloexec=&lt;bool&gt;
              Sets the FD_CLOEXEC flag with the fcntl()  system  call  to  value
              &lt;bool&gt;.  If  set,  the  file descriptor is closed on exec() family
              function calls. Socat internally handles this flag for the fds  it
              controls,  so  in  most  cases there will be no need to apply this
              option.

       setlk  Tries to set a discretionary write lock to the  whole  file  using
              the  fcntl(fd,  F_SETLK, ...)  system call. If the file is already
              locked, this call results in an error.  On Linux,  when  the  file
              permissions  for  group  are &quot;S&quot; (g-x,g+s), and the file system is
              locally mounted with the &quot;mand&quot; option,  the  lock  is  mandatory,
              i.e. prevents other processes from opening the file.

       setlkw Tries  to set a discretionary waiting write lock to the whole file
              using the fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, ...)  system call. If  the  file  is
              already  locked,  this call blocks.  See option setlk for informa&#8208;
              tion about making this lock mandatory.

       setlk-rd
              Tries to set a discretionary read lock to the whole file using the
              fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, ...)  system call. If the file is already write
              locked, this call results in  an  error.   See  option  setlk  for
              information about making this lock mandatory.

       setlkw-rd
              Tries  to  set a discretionary waiting read lock to the whole file
              using the fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, ...)  system call. If  the  file  is
              already  write  locked,  this  call  blocks.  See option setlk for
              information about making this lock mandatory.

       flock-ex
              Tries to set a blocking exclusive advisory lock to the file  using
              the  flock(fd,  LOCK_EX)  system call. Socat hangs in this call if
              the file is locked by another process.

       flock-ex-nb
              Tries to set a nonblocking exclusive advisory  lock  to  the  file
              using  the  flock(fd, LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB) system call. If the file is
              already locked, this option results in an error.

       flock-sh
              Tries to set a blocking shared advisory lock to the file using the
              flock(fd,  LOCK_SH)  system  call. Socat hangs in this call if the
              file is locked by another process.

       flock-sh-nb
              Tries to set a nonblocking shared advisory lock to the file  using
              the flock(fd, LOCK_SH|LOCK_NB) system call. If the file is already
              locked, this option results in an error.

       lock   Sets a blocking lock on the file. Uses the setlk or  flock  mecha&#8208;
              nism depending on availability on the particular platform. If both
              are available, the POSIX variant (setlkw) is used.

       user=&lt;user&gt;
              Sets the &lt;user&gt; (owner) of the stream.  If the address  is  member
              of  the  NAMED  option  group,  socat uses the chown() system call
              after opening the file or binding to the UNIX domain socket  (race
              condition!).  Without filesystem entry, socat sets the user of the
              stream using the fchown() system call.  These calls might  require
              root privilege.

       user-late=&lt;user&gt;
              Sets  the  owner of the fd to &lt;user&gt; with the fchown() system call
              after opening or connecting the channel.  This is useful  only  on
              file system entries.

       group=&lt;group&gt;
              Sets  the  &lt;group&gt; of the stream.  If the address is member of the
              NAMED option group, socat uses the chown() system call after open&#8208;
              ing  the  file  or  binding to the UNIX domain socket (race condi&#8208;
              tion!).  Without filesystem entry, socat sets  the  group  of  the
              stream  with  the fchown() system call.  These calls might require
              group membership or root privilege.
&#12;       group-late=&lt;group&gt;
              Sets the group of the fd to &lt;group&gt; with the fchown() system  call
              after  opening  or connecting the channel.  This is useful only on
              file system entries.

       mode=&lt;mode&gt;
              Sets the &lt;mode&gt; [mode_t] (permissions)  of  the  stream.   If  the
              address is member of the NAMED option group and uses the open() or
              creat() call, the mode is applied with these.  If the  address  is
              member of the NAMED option group without using these system calls,
              socat uses the chmod() system call after  opening  the  filesystem
              entry  or  binding  to  the  UNIX domain socket (race condition!).
              Otherwise, socat sets the mode of  the  stream  using  fchmod()  .
              These calls might require ownership or root privilege.

       perm-late=&lt;mode&gt;
              Sets  the permissions of the fd to value &lt;mode&gt; [mode_t] using the
              fchmod() system call after  opening  or  connecting  the  channel.
              This is useful only on file system entries.

       append=&lt;bool&gt;
              Always  writes  data to the actual end of file.  If the address is
              member of the OPEN option group, socat uses the O_APPEND flag with
              the  open()  system  call (example).  Otherwise, socat applies the
              fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_APPEND) call.

       nonblock=&lt;bool&gt;
              Tries to open or use file in nonblocking mode.  Its  only  effects
              are  that  the connect() call of TCP addresses does not block, and
              that opening a named pipe for reading  does  not  block.   If  the
              address  is member of the OPEN option group, socat uses the O_NON&#8208;
              BLOCK flag with the open() system call.  Otherwise, socat  applies
              the fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) call.

       binary Opens  the  file  in binary mode to avoid implicit line terminator
              conversions (Cygwin).

       text   Opens the file in text mode to force implicit line terminator con&#8208;
              versions (Cygwin).

       noinherit
              Does not keep this file open in a spawned process (Cygwin).

       cool-write
              Takes  it  easy when write fails with EPIPE or ECONNRESET and logs
              the message with notice level instead of error.  This prevents the
              log  file from being filled with useless error messages when socat
              is used as a high volume server or proxy where clients often abort
              the connection.
              This option is experimental.

       end-close
              Changes  the  (address dependent) method of ending a connection to
              just close the file descriptors. This is useful when  the  connec&#8208;
              tion is to be reused by or shared with other processes (example).
              Normally,  socket connections will be ended with shutdown(2) which
              terminates the socket even if it is shared by multiple  processes.
              close(2) &quot;unlinks&quot; the socket from the process but keeps it active
              as long as there are still links from other processes.
              Similarly, when an address of type EXEC or SYSTEM is ended,  socat
              usually will explicitly kill the sub process. With this option, it
              will just close the file descriptors.

       shut-none
              Changes the (address dependent) method of shutting down the  write
              part of a connection to not do anything.

       shut-down
              Changes  the (address dependent) method of shutting down the write
              part of a connection to shutdown\(fd,  SHUT_WR).  Is  only  useful
              with sockets.

       shut-close
              Changes  the (address dependent) method of shutting down the write
              part of a connection to close\(fd).

       shut-null
              When one address indicates EOF,  socat  will  send  a  zero  sized
              packet  to  the write channel of the other address to transfer the
              EOF condition. This is useful with UDP and other  datagram  proto&#8208;
              cols.  Has  been tested against netcat and socat with option null-
              eof.

       null-eof
              Normally socat will  ignore  empty  (zero  size  payload)  packets
              arriving on datagram sockets, so it survives port scans. With this
              option socat interprets empty datagram packets  as  EOF  indicator
              (see shut-null).

       ioctl-void=&lt;request&gt;
              Calls  ioctl()  with the request value as second argument and NULL
              as third argument. This option allows to utilize ioctls  that  are
              not explicitly implemented in socat.

       ioctl-int=&lt;request&gt;:&lt;value&gt;
              Calls  ioctl()  with  the request value as second argument and the
              integer value as third argument.

       ioctl-intp=&lt;request&gt;:&lt;value&gt;
              Calls ioctl() with the request value  as  second  argument  and  a
              pointer to the integer value as third argument.

       ioctl-bin=&lt;request&gt;:&lt;value&gt;
              Calls  ioctl()  with  the  request  value as second argument and a
              pointer to the given data value as third argument. This data  must
              be specified in &lt;dalan&gt; form.

       ioctl-string=&lt;request&gt;:&lt;value&gt;
              Calls  ioctl()  with  the  request  value as second argument and a
              pointer to the given string as third argument.  &lt;dalan&gt; form.


       NAMED option group

       These options work on file system entries.
       See also options user, group, and mode.

       user-early=&lt;user&gt;
              Changes the &lt;user&gt; (owner) of the file system entry before access&#8208;
              ing  it,  using  the  chown() system call. This call might require
              root privilege.

       group-early=&lt;group&gt;
              Changes the &lt;group&gt; of the file system entry before accessing  it,
              using  the chown() system call. This call might require group mem&#8208;
              bership or root privilege.

       perm-early=&lt;mode&gt;
              Changes the &lt;mode&gt;  [mode_t]  of  the  file  system  entry  before
              accessing  it,  using  the  chmod()  system  call. This call might
              require ownership or root privilege.

       umask=&lt;mode&gt;
              Sets the umask of the process to &lt;mode&gt; [mode_t] before  accessing
              the  file  system  entry  (useful with UNIX domain sockets!). This
              call might affect all further operations of the socat process!

       unlink-early
              Unlinks (removes) the file  before  opening  it  and  even  before
              applying user-early etc.

       unlink Unlinks  (removes)  the  file before accessing it, but after user-
              early etc.

       unlink-late
              Unlinks (removes) the file after opening it to make it  inaccessi&#8208;
              ble for other processes after a short race condition.

       unlink-close
              Removes  the addresses file system entry when closing the address.
              For named pipes, listening unix domain sockets, and  the  symbolic
              links  of  pty  addresses,  the  default  is 1; for created files,
              opened files, generic opened files, and client unix domain sockets
              the default is 0.


       OPEN option group

       The  OPEN  group  options allow to set flags with the open() system call.
       E.g., option `creat&apos; sets the O_CREAT flag.
       See also options append and nonblock.

       creat=&lt;bool&gt;
              Creates the file if it does not exist (example).

       dsync=&lt;bool&gt;
              Blocks write() calls  until  metainfo  is  physically  written  to
              media.

       excl=&lt;bool&gt;
              With option creat, if file exists this is an error.

       largefile=&lt;bool&gt;
              On 32 bit systems, allows a file larger than 2^31 bytes.

       noatime
              Sets  the  O_NOATIME  options,  so  reads do not change the access
              timestamp.

       noctty=&lt;bool&gt;
              Does not make this file the controlling terminal.

       nofollow=&lt;bool&gt;
              Does not follow symbolic links.

       nshare=&lt;bool&gt;
              Does not allow to share this file with other processes.

       rshare=&lt;bool&gt;
              Does not allow other processes to open this file for writing.

       rsync=&lt;bool&gt;
              Blocks write() until metainfo is physically written to media.

       sync=&lt;bool&gt;
              Blocks write() until data is physically written to media.

       rdonly=&lt;bool&gt;
              Opens the file for reading only.

       wronly=&lt;bool&gt;
              Opens the file for writing only.

       trunc  Truncates the file to size 0 during opening it.


       REG and BLK option group

       These options are usually applied to a UN*X file  descriptor,  but  their
       semantics make sense only on a file supporting random access.

       seek=&lt;offset&gt;
              Applies  the  lseek(fd,  &lt;offset&gt;,  SEEK_SET) (or lseek64 ) system
              call, thus positioning the file  pointer  absolutely  to  &lt;offset&gt;
              [off_t  or  off64_t]. Please note that a missing value defaults to
              1, not 0.

       seek-cur=&lt;offset&gt;
              Applies the lseek(fd, &lt;offset&gt;, SEEK_CUR)  (or  lseek64  )  system
              call,  thus  positioning  the  file  pointer  &lt;offset&gt;  [off_t  or
              off64_t] bytes relatively to its current position (which  is  usu&#8208;
              ally 0). Please note that a missing value defaults to 1, not 0.

       seek-end=&lt;offset&gt;
              Applies  the  lseek(fd,  &lt;offset&gt;,  SEEK_END) (or lseek64 ) system
              call,  thus  positioning  the  file  pointer  &lt;offset&gt;  [off_t  or
              off64_t]  bytes  relatively  to the files current end. Please note
              that a missing value defaults to 1, not 0.

       ftruncate=&lt;offset&gt;
              Applies the ftruncate(fd, &lt;offset&gt;) (or ftruncate64 if  available)
              system  call,  thus  truncating  the file at the position &lt;offset&gt;
              [off_t or off64_t]. Please note that a missing value  defaults  to
              1, not 0.

       secrm=&lt;bool&gt;

       unrm=&lt;bool&gt;

       compr=&lt;bool&gt;

       ext2-sync=&lt;bool&gt;

       immutable=&lt;bool&gt;

       ext2-append=&lt;bool&gt;

       nodump=&lt;bool&gt;

       ext2-noatime=&lt;bool&gt;

       journal-data=&lt;bool&gt;

       notail=&lt;bool&gt;

       dirsync=&lt;bool&gt;
              These  options  change  non  standard file attributes on operating
              systems and file systems that support these features,  like  Linux
              with ext2fs, ext3fs, or reiserfs. See man 1 chattr for information
              on these options.  Please note that there might be a  race  condi&#8208;
              tion between creating the file and applying these options.


       PROCESS option group

       Options  of  this  group  change  the  process properties instead of just
       affecting one data channel.  For EXEC and SYSTEM addresses and for LISTEN
       and  CONNECT  type addresses with option FORK, these options apply to the
       child processes instead of the main socat process.

       chroot=&lt;directory&gt;
              Performs a chroot() operation to &lt;directory&gt; after processing  the
              address (example). This call might require root privilege.

       chroot-early=&lt;directory&gt;
              Performs  a  chroot()  operation to &lt;directory&gt; before opening the
              address. This call might require root privilege.

       setgid=&lt;group&gt;
              Changes the primary &lt;group&gt; of the process  after  processing  the
              address.  This call might require root privilege. Please note that
              this option does not drop other group related privileges.

       setgid-early=&lt;group&gt;
              Like setgit but is performed before opening the address.

       setuid=&lt;user&gt;
              Changes the &lt;user&gt; (owner) of the  process  after  processing  the
              address.  This call might require root privilege. Please note that
              this option does not  drop  group  related  privileges.  Check  if
              option su better fits your needs.

       setuid-early=&lt;user&gt;
              Like setuid but is performed before opening the address.

       su=&lt;user&gt;
              Changes  the  &lt;user&gt;  (owner) and groups of the process after pro&#8208;
              cessing the address (example). This call might require root privi&#8208;
              lege.

       su-d=&lt;user&gt;
              Short  name for substuser-delayed.  Changes the &lt;user&gt; (owner) and
              groups of the process after processing the address (example).  The
              user  and  his  groups  are retrieved before a possible chroot() .
              This call might require root privilege.

       setpgid=&lt;pid_t&gt;
              Makes the process a member of the specified process group &lt;pid_t&gt;.
              If  no  value  is  given,  or  if the value is 0 or 1, the process
              becomes leader of a new process group.

       setsid Makes the process the leader of a new session (example).


       READLINE option group

       These options apply to the readline address type.

       history=&lt;filename&gt;
              Reads and writes history from/to &lt;filename&gt; (example).

       noprompt
              Since version 1.4.0, socat per default tries to determine a prompt
              -  that  is  then passed to the readline call - by remembering the
              last incomplete line of the output. With this option,  socat  does
              not  pass  a  prompt to readline, so it begins line editing in the
              first column of the terminal.

       noecho=&lt;pattern&gt;
              Specifies a regular pattern for a prompt that prevents the follow&#8208;
              ing  input  line from being displayed on the screen and from being
              added to the history.  The prompt is defined as the text that  was
              output to the readline address after the lastest newline character
              and before an input character was typed. The pattern is a  regular
              expression, e.g.  &quot;^[Pp]assword:.*$&quot; or &quot;([Uu]ser:|[Pp]assword:)&quot;.
              See regex\(7) for details.  (example)

       prompt=&lt;string&gt;
              Passes the string as prompt to  the  readline  function.  readline
              prints  this  prompt  when  stepping  through the history. If this
              string matches a constant prompt issued by an interactive  program
              on  the  other  socat  address,  consistent  look  and feel can be
              archieved.


       APPLICATION option group

       This group contains options that work at data  level.   Note  that  these
       options  only  apply  to  the &quot;raw&quot; data transferred by socat, but not to
       protocol data used by addresses like PROXY.

       cr     Converts the default line termination character  NL  (&apos;\n&apos;,  0x0a)
              to/from CR (&apos;\r&apos;, 0x0d) when writing/reading on this channel.

       crnl   Converts  the  default  line termination character NL (&apos;\n&apos;, 0x0a)
              to/from CRNL (&quot;\r\n&quot;, 0x0d0a) when writing/reading on this channel
              (example).  Note: socat simply strips all CR characters.

       ignoreeof
              When  EOF  occurs  on  this channel, socat ignores it and tries to
              read more data (like &quot;tail -f&quot;) (example).

       readbytes=&lt;bytes&gt;
              socat reads only so many bytes from this address (the address pro&#8208;
              vides  only  so  many bytes for transfer and pretends to be at EOF
              afterwards).  Must be greater than 0.

       lockfile=&lt;filename&gt;
              If lockfile exists, exits with error. If lockfile does not  exist,
              creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.

       waitlock=&lt;filename&gt;
              If  lockfile exists, waits until it disappears. When lockfile does
              not exist, creates it and continues, unlinks lockfile on exit.

       escape=&lt;int&gt;
              Specifies the numeric code of a character that triggers EOF on the
              input stream. It is useful with a terminal in raw mode (example).


       SOCKET option group

       These  options  are  intended  for  all kinds of sockets, e.g. IP or UNIX
       domain. Most are applied with a setsockopt() call.

       bind=&lt;sockname&gt;
              Binds the socket to the given socket address using the bind() sys&#8208;
              tem  call.  The form of &lt;sockname&gt; is socket domain dependent: IP4
              and IP6  allow  the  form  [hostname|hostaddress][:(service|port)]
              (example), UNIX domain sockets require &lt;filename&gt;.

       connect-timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Abort  the connection attempt after &lt;seconds&gt; [timeval] with error
              status.

       so-bindtodevice=&lt;interface&gt;
              Binds the socket to the  given  &lt;interface&gt;.   This  option  might
              require root privilege.

       broadcast
              For  datagram  sockets,  allows sending to broadcast addresses and
              receiving packets addressed to broadcast addresses.

       debug  Enables socket debugging.

       dontroute
              Only communicates with directly  connected  peers,  does  not  use
              routers.

       keepalive
              Enables sending keepalives on the socket.

       linger=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Blocks shutdown() or close() until data transfers have finished or
              the given timeout [int] expired.

       oobinline
              Places out-of-band data in the input data stream.

       priority=&lt;priority&gt;
              Sets the protocol defined &lt;priority&gt; [&lt;int&gt;] for outgoing packets.

       rcvbuf=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the size of the receive buffer after  the  socket()  call  to
              &lt;bytes&gt;  [int].   With  TCP sockets, this value corresponds to the
              socket&apos;s maximal window size.

       rcvbuf-late=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the size of the receive buffer when  the  socket  is  already
              connected  to  &lt;bytes&gt; [int].  With TCP sockets, this value corre&#8208;
              sponds to the socket&apos;s maximal window size.

       rcvlowat=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Specifies the minimum number of received  bytes  [int]  until  the
              socket layer will pass the buffered data to socat.

       rcvtimeo=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Sets the receive timeout [timeval].

       reuseaddr
              Allows  other  sockets  to  bind to an address even if parts of it
              (e.g. the local port) are already in use by socat (example).

       sndbuf=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the size of the  send  buffer  after  the  socket()  call  to
              &lt;bytes&gt; [int].

       sndbuf-late=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets  the  size of the send buffer when the socket is connected to
              &lt;bytes&gt; [int].

       sndlowat=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Specifies the minimum number of bytes in the send buffer until the
              socket layer will send the data to &lt;bytes&gt; [int].

       sndtimeo=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Sets the send timeout to seconds [timeval].

       pf=&lt;string&gt;
              Forces  the  use of the specified IP version or protocol. &lt;string&gt;
              can be something like &quot;ip4&quot; or &quot;ip6&quot;. The resulting value is  used
              as  first  argument  to  the socket() or socketpair() calls.  This
              option affects address resolution and the required syntax of  bind
              and range options.

       type=&lt;type&gt;
              Sets  the  type of the socket, specified as second argument to the
              socket() or socketpair() calls, to &lt;type&gt; [int].  Address  resolu&#8208;
              tion  is not affected by this option.  Under Linux, 1 means stream
              oriented socket, 2 means datagram socket, and 3 means raw socket.

       prototype
              Sets the protocol of the socket, specified as  third  argument  to
              the  socket() or socketpair() calls, to &lt;prototype&gt; [int]. Address
              resolution is not affected by this option.  6 means TCP, 17  means
              UDP.

       so-timestamp
              Sets  the  SO_TIMESTAMP  socket option. This enables receiving and
              logging of timestamp ancillary messages.

       setsockopt-int=&lt;level&gt;:&lt;optname&gt;:&lt;optval&gt;
              Invokes setsockopt() for the socket  with  the  given  parameters.
              level  [int] is used as second argument to setsockopt() and speci&#8208;
              fies the layer, e.g. SOL_TCP for TCP (6 on Linux),  or  SOL_SOCKET
              for  the  socket  layer  (1  on Linux). optname [int] is the third
              argument to setsockopt() and tells which socket option  is  to  be
              set.  For  the actual numbers you might have to look up the appro&#8208;
              priate include files of your system. The 4th setsockopt()  parame&#8208;
              ter,  value  [int], is passed to the function per pointer, and for
              the length parameter sizeof\(int) is taken implicitely.

       setsockopt-bin=&lt;level&gt;:&lt;optname&gt;:&lt;optval&gt;
              Like setsockopt-int, but &lt;optval&gt; must be provided in dalan format
              and specifies an arbitrary sequence of bytes; the length parameter
              is automatically derived from the data.
&#12;       setsockopt-string=&lt;level&gt;:&lt;optname&gt;:&lt;optval&gt;
              Like setsockopt-int, but &lt;optval&gt; must be a string.   This  string
              is  passed  to  the function with trailing null character, and the
              length parameter is automatically derived from the data.


       UNIX option group

       These options apply to UNIX domain based addresses.

       unix-tightsocklen=[0|1]
              On socket operations, pass a socket address length that  does  not
              include  the  whole  struct  sockaddr_un record but (besides other
              components) only the relevant part of  the  filename  or  abstract
              string. Default is 1.


       IP4 and IP6 option groups

       These options can be used with IPv4 and IPv6 based sockets.

       tos=&lt;tos&gt;
              Sets  the TOS (type of service) field of outgoing packets to &lt;tos&gt;
              [byte] (see RFC 791).

       ttl=&lt;ttl&gt;
              Sets the TTL (time to live) field of  outgoing  packets  to  &lt;ttl&gt;
              [byte].

       ip-options=&lt;data&gt;
              Sets IP options like source routing. Must be given in binary form,
              recommended format is a leading &quot;x&quot; followed by an even number  of
              hex  digits.  This  option  may  be  used multiple times, data are
              appended.  E.g., to connect to  host  10.0.0.1  via  some  gateway
              using  a  loose source route, use the gateway as address parameter
              and  set   a   loose   source   route   using   the   option   ip-
              options=x8307040a000001 .
              IP options are defined in RFC 791.

       mtudiscover=&lt;0|1|2&gt;
              Takes  0,  1, 2 to never, want, or always use path MTU discover on
              this socket.

       ip-pktinfo
              Sets the IP_PKTINFO socket option. This enables receiving and log&#8208;
              ging  of  ancillary  messages  containing  destination address and
              interface (Linux) (example).

       ip-recverr

              ging of TTL (time to live) ancillary messages (Linux, *BSD).

       ip-recvdstaddr
              Sets the IP_RECVDSTADDR socket option. This enables receiving  and
              logging  of  ancillary  messages  containing  destination  address
              (*BSD) (example).

       ip-recvif
              Sets the IP_RECVIF socket option. This enables receiving and  log&#8208;
              ging of interface ancillary messages (*BSD) (example).

       ip-add-membership=&lt;multicast-address:interface-address&gt;

       ip-add-membership=&lt;multicast-address:interface-name&gt;

       ip-add-membership=&lt;multicast-address:interface-index&gt;

       ip-add-membership=&lt;multicast-address:interface-address:interface-name&gt;

       ip-add-membership=&lt;multicast-address:interface-address:interface-index&gt;
              Makes  the socket member of the specified multicast group. This is
              currently only implemented for  IPv4.  The  option  takes  the  IP
              address  of the multicast group and info about the desired network
              interface. The most common syntax is the first one, while the oth&#8208;
              ers  are  only  available  on  systems  that  provide struct mreqn
              (Linux).
              The indices of active network interfaces can be  shown  using  the
              utility procan.

       ip-multicast-if=&lt;hostname&gt;
              Specifies  hostname or address of the network interface to be used
              for multicast traffic.

       ip-multicast-loop=&lt;bool&gt;
              Specifies if outgoing multicast traffic should loop  back  to  the
              interface.

       ip-multicast-ttl=&lt;byte&gt;
              Sets the TTL used for outgoing multicast traffic. Default is 1.

       res-primary

       res-igntc

       res-recurse

       res-defnames

       res-stayopen

       res-dnsrch
              These  options  set  the  corresponding resolver (name resolution)
              option flags.  Append &quot;=0&quot; to clear  a  default  option.  See  man
              resolver\(5)  for  more  information on these options. Note: these
              options are valid only for the address they are applied to.

       IP6 option group

       These options can only be used on IPv6 based sockets. See IP options  for
       options that can be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.

       ipv6only=&lt;bool&gt;
              Sets  the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option. If 0, the TCP stack will also
              accept connections using IPv4  protocol  on  the  same  port.  The
              default is system dependent.

       ipv6-recvdstopts
              Sets  the  IPV6_RECVDSTOPTS  socket option. This enables receiving
              and logging  of  ancillary  messages  containing  the  destination
              options.

       ipv6-recvhoplimit
              Sets  the  IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT socket option. This enables receiving
              and logging of ancillary messages containing the hoplimit.

       ipv6-recvhopopts
              Sets the IPV6_RECVHOPOPTS socket option.  This  enables  receiving
              and logging of ancillary messages containing the hop options.

       ipv6-recvpktinfo
              Sets  the  IPV6_RECVPKTINFO  socket option. This enables receiving
              and logging of ancillary messages containing  destination  address
              and interface.

       ipv6-unicast-hops=link(TYPE_INT)(&lt;int&gt;)
              Sets  the IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS socket option. This sets the hop count
              limit (TTL) for outgoing unicast packets.

       ipv6-recvrthdr
              Sets the IPV6_RECVRTHDR socket option. This enables receiving  and
              logging of ancillary messages containing routing information.

       ipv6-tclass
              Sets  the  IPV6_TCLASS socket option. This sets the transfer class
              of outgoing packets.

       ipv6-recvtclass
              Sets the IPV6_RECVTCLASS socket option. This enables receiving and
              logging of ancillary messages containing the transfer class.


       TCP option group

       These  options  may be applied to TCP sockets. They work by invoking set&#8208;
       sockopt() with the appropriate parameters.

       cork   Doesn&apos;t send packets smaller than MSS (maximal segment size).

       defer-accept
              While listening, accepts connections only when data from the  peer
              arrived.

              Sets  the  number of keepalives before shutting down the socket to
              &lt;count&gt; [int].

       keepidle=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Sets the idle time before sending the first keepalive to &lt;seconds&gt;
              [int].

       keepintvl=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Sets the interval between two keepalives to &lt;seconds&gt; [int].

       linger2=&lt;seconds&gt;
              Sets  the time to keep the socket in FIN-WAIT-2 state to &lt;seconds&gt;
              [int].

       mss=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the MSS (maximum segment size) after  the  socket()  call  to
              &lt;bytes&gt;  [int].  This  value is then proposed to the peer with the
              SYN or SYN/ACK packet (example).

       mss-late=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the MSS of the socket after connection has  been  established
              to &lt;bytes&gt; [int].

       nodelay
              Turns  off  the  Nagle algorithm for measuring the RTT (round trip
              time).

       rfc1323
              Enables RFC1323 TCP options: TCP  window  scale,  round-trip  time
              measurement  (RTTM),  and protect against wrapped sequence numbers
              (PAWS) (AIX).

       stdurg Enables RFC1122 compliant urgent pointer handling (AIX).

       syncnt=&lt;count&gt;
              Sets the maximal number  of  SYN  retransmits  during  connect  to
              &lt;count&gt; [int].

       md5sig Enables generation of MD5 digests on the packets (FreeBSD).

              tial connect (HP-UX).

       keepinit
              Sets  the  time  to  wait  for an answer of the server during con&#8208;
              nect\() before giving up. Value in half seconds,  default  is  150
              (75s) (Tru64).

       paws   Enables  the  &quot;protect  against  wrapped sequence numbers&quot; feature
              (Tru64).

       sackena
              Enables selective acknowledge (Tru64).

       tsoptena
              Enables the time stamp option that  allows  RTT  recalculation  on
              existing connections (Tru64).


       SCTP option group

       These options may be applied to SCTP stream sockets.

       sctp-nodelay
              Sets  the SCTP_NODELAY socket option that disables the Nagle algo&#8208;
              rithm.

       sctp-maxseg=&lt;bytes&gt;
              Sets the SCTP_MAXSEG socket option to &lt;bytes&gt; [int].   This  value
              is then proposed to the peer with the SYN or SYN/ACK packet.


       UDP, TCP, and SCTP option groups

       Here  we  find options that are related to the network port mechanism and
       thus can be used with UDP, TCP, and SCTP client and server addresses.

       sourceport=&lt;port&gt;
              For outgoing (client) TCP and UDP connections, it sets the  source
              &lt;port&gt;  using  an  extra  bind()  call.   With  TCP  or UDP listen
              addresses, socat immediately shuts  down  the  connection  if  the
              client does not use this sourceport (example).

       lowport
              Outgoing  (client) TCP and UDP connections with this option use an
              unused random source port between 640 and 1023 incl. On UNIX class
              operating  systems,  this  requires root privilege, and thus indi&#8208;
              cates that the client process is authorized by  local  root.   TCP
              and  UDP  listen  addresses with this option immediately shut down
              the connection if the client does not use a  sourceport  &lt;=  1023.
              This  mechanism  can provide limited authorization under some cir&#8208;
              cumstances.


       SOCKS option group

       When using SOCKS type addresses, some socks specific options can be set.

       socksport=&lt;tcp service&gt;
              Overrides the default &quot;socks&quot; service or port 1080 for  the  socks
              server port with &lt;TCP service&gt;.

       socksuser=&lt;user&gt;
              Sends  the  &lt;user&gt;  [string]  in  the  username field to the socks
              server. Default is the actual user name ($LOGNAME or $USER) (exam&#8208;
              ple).


       HTTP option group

       Options  that  can  be  provided  with HTTP type addresses. The only HTTP
       address currently implemented is proxy-connect.

       proxyport=&lt;TCP service&gt;
              Overrides the default HTTP proxy port 8080 with &lt;TCP service&gt;.

       ignorecr
              The HTTP protocol requires the use of CR+NL  as  line  terminator.
              When a proxy server violates this standard, socat might not under&#8208;
              stand its answer.  This option directs socat to interprete  NL  as
              line  terminator  and  to  ignore  CR in the answer. Nevertheless,
              socat sends CR+NL to the proxy.

       proxyauth=&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;
              Provide &quot;basic&quot; authentication to the proxy server.  The  argument
              to the option is used with a &quot;Proxy-Authorization: Base&quot; header in
              base64 encoded form.
              Note: username and password are visible  for  every  user  on  the
              local  machine  in  the  process  list;  username and password are
              transferred to the proxy server unencrypted (base64  encoded)  and
              might be sniffed.

       resolve
              Per default, socat sends to the proxy a CONNECT request containing
              the target hostname. With this option, socat resolves the hostname
              locally  and  sends the IP address. Please note that, according to
              RFC 2396, only name resolution to IPv4 addresses is implemented.


       RANGE option group

       These options check if a connecting client should be granted access. They
       can  be  applied to listening and receiving network sockets. tcp-wrappers
       options fall into this group.

       range=&lt;address-range&gt;
              After accepting a connection, tests if the peer is  within  range.
              For  IPv4  addresses,  address-range  takes the form address/bits,
              e.g.  10.0.0.0/8, or address:mask, e.g. 10.0.0.0:255.0.0.0  (exam&#8208;
              ple);  for IPv6, it is [ip6-address/bits], e.g. [::1/128].  If the
              client address does not match, socat issues a  warning  and  keeps
              listening/receiving.

       tcpwrap[=&lt;name&gt;]
              Uses  Wietse  Venema&apos;s  libwrap (tcpd) library to determine if the
              client  is  allowed  to  connect.  The  configuration  files   are
              /etc/hosts.allow  and  /etc/hosts.deny  per  default,  see  &quot;man 5
              hosts_access&quot; for more  information.  The  optional  &lt;name&gt;  (type
              string)  is passed to the wrapper functions as daemon process name
              (example).   If  omitted,  the  basename  of   socats   invocation
              (argv[0])  is  passed.   If  both  tcpwrap  and  range options are
              applied to an address, both conditions must be fulfilled to  allow
              the connection.

       allow-table=&lt;filename&gt;
              Takes the specified file instead of /etc/hosts.allow.

       deny-table=&lt;filename&gt;
              Takes the specified file instead of /etc/hosts.deny.

       tcpwrap-etc=&lt;directoryname&gt;
              Looks  for  hosts.allow and hosts.deny in the specified directory.
              Is overridden by options hosts-allow and hosts-deny.


       LISTEN option group
&#12;       Options specific to listening sockets.

       backlog=&lt;count&gt;
              Sets the backlog value passed with the  listen()  system  call  to
              &lt;count&gt; [int]. Default is 5.


       CHILD option group

       Options for addresses with multiple connections via child processes.

       fork   After  establishing  a  connection, handles its channel in a child
              process and keeps the parent process attempting  to  produce  more
              connections, either by listening or by connecting in a loop (exam&#8208;
              ple).
              OPENSSL-CONNECT and SSL-LISTEN differ in when they  actually  fork
              off  the  child:  OPENSSL-LISTEN  forks  before the SSL handshake,
              while OPENSSL-CONNECT forks afterwards.  RETRY and FOREVER options
              are not inherited by the child process.


       EXEC option group

       Options for addresses that invoke a program.

       path=&lt;string&gt;
              Overrides  the PATH environment variable for searching the program
              with &lt;string&gt;. This $PATH value is effective in the child  process
              too.

       login  Prefixes  argv[0]  for  the  execvp() call with &apos;-&apos;, thus making a
              shell behave as login shell.


       FORK option group

       EXEC or SYSTEM addresses invoke a  program  using  a  child  process  and
       transfer  data between socat and the program. The interprocess communica&#8208;
       tion mechanism can be influenced with the following options. Per default,
       a  socketpair()  is created and assigned to stdin and stdout of the child
       process, while stderr is inherited from the socat process, and the  child
       process  uses  file  descriptors  0 and 1 for communicating with the main
       socat process.

       nofork Does not fork a subprocess  for  executing  the  program,  instead
              calls  execvp\()  or  system\()  directly  from  the  actual socat
              instance. This avoids the overhead of another process between  the
              program and its peer, but introduces a lot of restrictions:

       o      this option can only be applied to the second socat address.

       o      it cannot be applied to a part of a dual address.

       o      the first socat address cannot be OPENSSL or READLINE

       o      socat options -b, -t, -D, -l, -v, -x become useless

       o      for both addresses, options ignoreeof, cr, and crnl become useless

       o      for  the  second  address  (the  one  with option nofork), options
              append,  cloexec, flock, user, group, mode,  nonblock,  perm-late,
              setlk,  and setpgid cannot be applied. Some of these could be used
              on the first address though.

       pipes  Creates a pair of unnamed  pipes  for  interprocess  communication
              instead of a socket pair.

       openpty
              Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo ter&#8208;
              minal created with openpty() instead of the default (socketpair or
              ptmx).

       ptmx   Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo ter&#8208;
              minal created by opening /dev/ptmx  or  /dev/ptc  instead  of  the
              default (socketpair).
&#12;       pty    Establishes communication with the sub process using a pseudo ter&#8208;
              minal instead of a socket pair. Creates the pty with an  available
              mechanism.  If  openpty  and ptmx are both available, it uses ptmx
              because this is POSIX compliant (example).

       ctty   Makes the pty the controlling tty of the sub process (example).

       stderr Directs stderr of the sub process to its output channel by  making
              stderr a dup() of stdout (example).

       fdin=&lt;fdnum&gt;
              Assigns  the  sub  processes  input channel to its file descriptor
              &lt;fdnum&gt; instead of stdin (0). The program started from the subpro&#8208;
              cess has to use this fd for reading data from socat (example).

       fdout=&lt;fdnum&gt;
              Assigns  the  sub  processes output channel to its file descriptor
              &lt;fdnum&gt; instead of stdout (1). The program started from  the  sub&#8208;
              process has to use this fd for writing data to socat (example).

       sighup, sigint, sigquit
              Has  socat  pass  signals  of this type to the sub process.  If no
              address has this option, socat terminates on these signals.


       TERMIOS option group

       For  addresses  that  work  on  a  tty   (e.g.,   stdio,   file:/dev/tty,
       exec:...,pty), the terminal parameters defined in the UN*X termios mecha&#8208;
       nism are made available as address option parameters.  Please  note  that
       changes  of  the parameters of your interactive terminal remain effective
       after socat&apos;s termination, so you might have to enter  &quot;reset&quot;  or  &quot;stty
       sane&quot;  in  your  shell  afterwards.   For  EXEC and SYSTEM addresses with
       option PTY, these options apply to the pty by the child processes.

       b0     Disconnects the terminal.

       b19200 Sets the serial line speed to 19200 baud.  Some  other  rates  are
              possible; use something like socat -hh |grep &apos; b[1-9]&apos; to find all
              speeds supported by your implementation.
              Note: On some operating systems, these options may not  be  avail&#8208;
              able. Use ispeed or ospeed instead.

       echo=&lt;bool&gt;
              Enables or disables local echo (example).

       icanon=&lt;bool&gt;
              Sets  or  clears  canonical mode, enabling line buffering and some
              special characters.

       i-pop-all
              With UNIX System V STREAMS, removes all drivers from the stack.

       i-push=&lt;string&gt;
              With  UNIX  System  V STREAMS, pushes the driver (module) with the
              given name (string) onto the stack. For example, to make sure that
              a  character  device on Solaris supports termios etc, use the fol&#8208;
              lowing options:  i-pop-all,i-push=ptem,i-push=ldterm,i-push=ttcom&#8208;
              pat


       PTY option group
&#12;       These options are intended for use with the pty address type.

       link=&lt;filename&gt;
              Generates  a symbolic link that points to the actual pseudo termi&#8208;
              nal (pty). This might help to solve the problem that ptys are gen&#8208;
              erated  with more or less unpredictable names, making it difficult
              to directly access the socat  generated  pty  automatically.  With
              this  option, the user can specify a &quot;fix&quot; point in the file hier&#8208;
              archy that helps him to access the actual pty  (example).   Begin&#8208;
              ning  with  socat version 1.4.3, the symbolic link is removed when
              the address is closed (but see option unlink-close).

       wait-slave
              Blocks the open phase until a process opens the slave side of  the
              pty.  Usually, socat continues after generating the pty with open&#8208;
              ing the next address or with entering the transfer loop. With  the
              wait-slave  option, socat waits until some process opens the slave
              side of the pty before continuing.  This option only works if  the
              operating  system  provides the poll() system call. And it depends
              on an undocumented behaviour of pty&apos;s, so it does not work on  all
              operating systems. It has successfully been tested on Linux, Free&#8208;
              BSD, NetBSD, and on Tru64 with openpty.

       pty-interval=&lt;seconds&gt;
              When the wait-slave option is set, socat periodically  checks  the
              HUP  condition  using  poll()  to find if the pty&apos;s slave side has
              been opened. The default polling interval  is  1s.  Use  the  pty-
              interval option [timeval] to change this value.


       OPENSSL option group

       These options apply to the openssl and openssl-listen address types.

       cipher=&lt;cipherlist&gt;
              Selects  the  list of ciphers that may be used for the connection.
              See the man page of ciphers ,  section  CIPHER  LIST  FORMAT,  for
              detailed   information   about  syntax,  values,  and  default  of
              &lt;cipherlist&gt;.
              Several cipher strings may be given, separated by &apos;:&apos;.  Some  sim&#8208;
              ple cipher strings:

       3DES   Uses a cipher suite with triple DES.

       MD5    Uses a cipher suite with MD5.

       aNULL  Uses a cipher suite without authentication.

       NULL   Does not use encryption.

       HIGH   Uses  a  cipher  suite with &quot;high&quot; encryption.  Note that the peer
              must support the selected property, or the negotiation will fail.

       method=&lt;ssl-method&gt;
              Sets the protocol version to be used. Valid strings (not case sen&#8208;
              sitive) are:

       SSLv2  Select SSL protocol version 2.

       SSLv3  Select SSL protocol version 3.

       SSLv23 Select  SSL protocol version 2 or 3. This is the default when this
              option is not provided.

       TLSv1  Select TLS protocol version 1.

       verify=&lt;bool&gt;
              Controls check of the peer&apos;s certificate.  Default  is  1  (true).
              Disabling  verify  might open your socket for everyone, making the
              encryption useless!

       cert=&lt;filename&gt;
              Specifies the file  with  the  certificate  and  private  key  for
              authentication.    The  certificate  must  be  in  OpenSSL  format
              (*.pem).  With openssl-listen, use of this option is strongly rec&#8208;
              ommended. Except with cipher aNULL, &quot;no shared ciphers&quot; error will
              occur when no certificate is given.

       key=&lt;filename&gt;
              Specifies the file with the private key. The private key may be in
              this  file  or  in  the file given with the cert option. The party
              that has to proof that it is the owner of a certificate needs  the
              private key.

       dhparams=&lt;filename&gt;
              Specifies  the  file  with  the  Diffie  Hellman parameters. These
              parameters may also be in the file given with the cert  option  in
              which case the dhparams option is not needed.
&#12;       cafile=&lt;filename&gt;
              Specifies the file with the trusted (root) authority certificates.
              The file must be in PEM format and should contain one or more cer&#8208;
              tificates.  The  party  that checks the authentication of its peer
              trusts only certificates that are in this file.

       capath=&lt;dirname&gt;
              Specifies the directory with the trusted (root) certificates.  The
              directory must contain certificates in PEM format and their hashes
              (see OpenSSL documentation)

       egd=&lt;filename&gt;
              On some systems, openssl requires an  explicit  source  of  random
              data.  Specify  the  socket name where an entropy gathering daemon
              like egd provides random data, e.g. /dev/egd-pool.

       pseudo On systems where openssl cannot find an entropy source  and  where
              no entropy gathering daemon can be utilized, this option activates
              a mechanism for providing pseudo entropy.  This  is  archieved  by
              taking  the  current  time  in  microseconds  for feeding the libc
              pseudo random number generator with an initial value.  openssl  is
              then feeded with output from random\() calls.
              NOTE:This  mechanism  is  not  sufficient for generation of secure
              keys!

       fips   Enables FIPS mode if compiled in. For info about the FIPS  encryp&#8208;
              tion  implementation  standard  see http://oss-institute.org/fips-
              faq.html.  This mode might require that the involved  certificates
              are  generated  with a FIPS enabled version of openssl. Setting or
              clearing this option on one  socat  address  affects  all  OpenSSL
              addresses of this process.


       RETRY option group

       Options  that  control  retry of some system calls, especially connection
       attempts.

       retry=&lt;num&gt;
              Number of retries before  the  connection  or  listen  attempt  is
              aborted.  Default is 0, which means just one attempt.

       interval=&lt;timespec&gt;
              Time  between  consecutive attempts (seconds, [timespec]). Default
              is 1 second.

       forever
              Performs an unlimited number of retry attempts.


       TUN option group

       Options that control Linux TUN/TAP interface device addresses.

       tun-device=&lt;device-file&gt;
              Instructs socat to take another path for  the  TUN  clone  device.
              Default is /dev/net/tun.

       tun-name=&lt;if-name&gt;
              Gives  the  resulting network interface a specific name instead of
              the system generated (tun0, tun1, etc.)

       tun-type=[tun|tap]
              Sets the type of the TUN device; use this option to generate a TAP
              device. See the Linux docu for the difference between these types.
              When you try to establish a tunnel between two TUN devices,  their
              types should be the same.

       iff-no-pi
              Sets  the  IFF_NO_PI  flag  which  controls if the device includes
              additional packet information in the  tunnel.   When  you  try  to
              establish  a  tunnel  between  two TUN devices, these flags should
              have the same values.

       iff-up Sets the TUN network interface status UP. Strongly recommended.

       iff-broadcast
              Sets the BROADCAST flag of the TUN network interface.

       iff-debug
              Sets the DEBUG flag of the TUN network interface.

       iff-loopback
              Sets the LOOPBACK flag of the TUN network interface.

       iff-pointopoint
              Sets the POINTOPOINT flag of the TUN device.

       iff-notrailers
              Sets the NOTRAILERS flag of the TUN device.
&#12;       iff-running
              Sets the RUNNING flag of the TUN device.

       iff-noarp
              Sets the NOARP flag of the TUN device.

       iff-promisc
              Sets the PROMISC flag of the TUN device.

       iff-allmulti
              Sets the ALLMULTI flag of the TUN device.

       iff-master
              Sets the MASTER flag of the TUN device.

       iff-slave
              Sets the SLAVE flag of the TUN device.

       iff-multicast
              Sets the MULTICAST flag of the TUN device.

       iff-portsel
              Sets the PORTSEL flag of the TUN device.

       iff-automedia
              Sets the AUTOMEDIA flag of the TUN device.

       iff-dynamic
              Sets the DYNAMIC flag of the TUN device.

       This section explains the different data types  that  address  parameters
       and address options can take.

       address-range
              Is  currently  only  implemented  for  IPv4 and IPv6. See address-
              option `range&apos;

       bool   &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;; if value is omitted, &quot;1&quot; is taken.

       byte   An unsigned int number, read with strtoul() , lower  or  equal  to
              UCHAR_MAX .

       command-line
              A string specifying a program name and its arguments, separated by
              single spaces.

       data   A raw data specification following  dalan  syntax.  Currently  the
              only  valid form is a string starting with &apos;x&apos; followed by an even
              number of hex digits, specifying a sequence of bytes.

       directory

       group  If  the first character is a decimal digit, the value is read with
              strtoul() as unsigned integer specifying a group id. Otherwise, it
              must be an existing group name.

       int    A  number  following  the rules of the strtol() function with base
              &quot;0&quot;, i.e. decimal number, octal number with leading &quot;0&quot;, or  hexa&#8208;
              decimal number with leading &quot;0x&quot;. The value must fit into a C int.

       interface
              A  string  specifying  the  device  name of a network interface as
              shown by ifconfig or procan, e.g. &quot;eth0&quot;.

       IP address
              An IPv4 address in numbers-and-dots notation, an IPv6  address  in
              hex  notation enclosed in brackets, or a hostname that resolves to
              an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

              brackets, or a hostname that resolves to an IPv6 address.
              Examples:    [::1],     [1234:5678:9abc:def0:1234:5678:9abc:def0],
              ip6name.domain.org

       long   A number read with strtol() . The value must fit into a C long.

       long long
              A  number  read  with strtoll() . The value must fit into a C long
              long.

       sockname
              A socket address. See address-option `bind&apos;

       string A sequence of characters, not containing &apos;\0&apos;  and,  depending  on
              the position within the command line, &apos;:&apos;, &apos;,&apos;, or &quot;!!&quot;. Note that
              you might have to escape shell  meta  characters  in  the  command
              line.

       TCP service
              A  service  name,  not  starting with a digit, that is resolved by
              getservbyname() , or an unsigned int 16 bit number read with  str&#8208;
              toul() .

              struct timeval, consisting of seconds and microseconds.

       timespec
              A double float specifying seconds; the number  is  mapped  into  a
              struct timespec, consisting of seconds and nanoseconds.

       UDP service
              A  service  name,  not  starting with a digit, that is resolved by

              unsigned int.

       user   If the first character is a decimal digit, the value is read  with
              strtoul()  as unsigned integer specifying a user id. Otherwise, it
              must be an existing user name.


EXAMPLES
       socat - TCP4:www.domain.org:80


              transfers data between STDIO (-) and a TCP4 connection to port  80
              of  host  www.domain.org.  This  example results in an interactive
              connection similar to telnet or netcat. The stdin terminal parame&#8208;
              ters  are not changed, so you may close the relay with ^D or abort
              it with ^C.

       socat -d -d READLINE,history=$HOME/.http_history \
       TCP4:www.domain.org:www,crnl

              this is similar to the previous example, but you can edit the cur&#8208;
              rent  line  in  a  bash like manner (READLINE) and use the history
              file .http_history; socat prints messages about progress (-d  -d).
              The   port is specified by service name (www), and correct network
              line termination characters (crnl) instead of NL are used.

       socat TCP4-LISTEN:www TCP4:www.domain.org:www


              installs a simple TCP port forwarder. With TCP4-LISTEN it  listens
              on  local port &quot;www&quot; until a connection comes in, accepts it, then
              connects to the remote host (TCP4) and starts  data  transfer.  It
              will not accept a econd connection.

       socat -d -d -lmlocal2 \
       TCP4-LISTEN:80,bind=myaddr1,reuseaddr,fork,su=nobody,range=10.0.0.0/8 \
       TCP4:www.domain.org:80,bind=myaddr2

              TCP  port  forwarder,  each side bound to another local IP address
              (bind). This example handles an almost arbitrary number of  paral&#8208;
              lel  or  consecutive  connections  by fork&apos;ing a new process after
              each accept() . It provides a little security by  su&apos;ing  to  user
              nobody after forking; it only permits connections from the private
              10 network (range); due to reuseaddr, it allows immediate  restart
              after master process&apos;s termination, even if some child sockets are
              not completely shut down.  With -lmlocal2, socat  logs  to  stderr
              until  successfully  reaching  the accept loop. Further logging is
              directed to syslog with facility local2.

       socat TCP4-LISTEN:5555,fork,tcpwrap=script \
       EXEC:/bin/myscript,chroot=/home/sandbox,su-d=sandbox,pty,stderr

              a simple server that accepts connections (TCP4-LISTEN) and  fork&apos;s
              a  new child process for each connection; every child acts as sin&#8208;
              gle relay.  The client must match the  rules  for  daemon  process
              name  &quot;script&quot;  in /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, otherwise
              it is refused access (see &quot;man 5 hosts_access&quot;).   For  EXEC&apos;uting
              the  program, the child process chroot&apos;s to /home/sandbox, su&apos;s to
              user  sandbox,   and   then   starts   the   program   /home/sand&#8208;
              box/bin/myscript.  Socat and myscript communicate via a pseudo tty
              (pty); myscript&apos;s stderr is redirected to  stdout,  so  its  error
              messages are transferred via socat to the connected client.

       socat EXEC:&quot;mail.sh target@domain.com&quot;,fdin=3,fdout=4 \
       TCP4:mail.relay.org:25,crnl,bind=alias1.server.org,mss=512

              mail.sh is a shell script, distributed with socat, that implements
              a simple SMTP client. It is programmed to &quot;speak&quot; SMTP on its  FDs
              3  (in) and 4 (out).  The fdin and fdout options tell socat to use
              these FDs for communication  with  the  program.  Because  mail.sh
              inherits  stdin  and  stdout  while  socat  does not use them, the
              script can read a mail body from stdin. Socat  makes  alias1  your
              local source address (bind), cares for correct network line termi&#8208;
              nation (crnl) and sends at most 512 data bytes per packet (mss).

       socat -,raw,echo=0,escape=0x0f /dev/ttyS0,raw,echo=0,crnl


              opens an interactive connection via  the  serial  line,  e.g.  for
              talking  with  a modem. raw and echo set the console&apos;s and ttyS0&apos;s
              terminal parameters to practicable values, crnl converts  to  cor&#8208;
              rect  newline  characters.  escape  allows  to terminate the socat
              process with character control-O.  Consider using READLINE instead
              of the first address.

       socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/.X11-unix/X1,fork \
       SOCKS4:host.victim.org:127.0.0.1:6000,socksuser=nobody,sourceport=20

              with  UNIX-LISTEN,  socat  opens  a  listening  UNIX domain socket
              /tmp/.X11-unix/X1. This path corresponds to local XWindow  display
              :1  on  your  machine, so XWindow client connections to DISPLAY=:1
              are accepted. Socat then speaks with the SOCKS4  server  host.vic&#8208;
              tim.org  that  might permit sourceport 20 based connections due to
              an FTP related weakness in its static IP filters.  Socat  pretends
              to be invoked by socksuser nobody, and requests to be connected to
              loopback port 6000 (only  weak  sockd  configurations  will  allow
              this).  So  we get a connection to the victims XWindow server and,
              if it does not require MIT cookies or Kerberos authentication,  we
              can  start work. Please note that there can only be one connection
              at a time, because TCP can establish only one session with a given
              set of addresses and ports.

       socat -u /tmp/readdata,seek-end=0,ignoreeof -


              this  is  an  example for unidirectional data transfer (-u). Socat
              transfers data from file /tmp/readdata (implicit  address  GOPEN),
              starting  at  its current end (seek-end=0 lets socat start reading
              at current end of file; use seek=0 or no seek option to first read
              the  existing  data)  in  a  &quot;tail  -f&quot; like mode (ignoreeof). The
              &quot;file&quot; might also be a listening UNIX domain socket (do not use  a
              seek option then).

       (sleep 5; echo PASSWORD; sleep 5; echo ls; sleep 1) |
       socat - EXEC:&apos;ssh -l user server&apos;,pty,setsid,ctty

              EXEC&apos;utes  an  ssh session to server. Uses a pty for communication
              between socat and ssh, makes it ssh&apos;s controlling tty (ctty),  and
              makes  this  pty the owner of a new process group (setsid), so ssh
              accepts the password from socat.

       socat -u TCP4-LISTEN:3334,reuseaddr,fork \
       OPEN:/tmp/in.log,creat,append

              implements a simple network based  message  collector.   For  each
              client  connecting  to port 3334, a new child process is generated
              (option fork).  All data sent by the clients are append&apos;ed to  the
              file  /tmp/in.log.   If the file does not exist, socat creat&apos;s it.
              Option reuseaddr allows immediate restart of the server process.

       socat READLINE,noecho=&apos;[Pp]assword:&apos;  EXEC:&apos;ftp  ftp.server.com&apos;,pty,set&#8208;
       sid,ctty


              wraps  a  command line history (READLINE) around the EXEC&apos;uted ftp
              client utility.  This allows editing and reuse of FTP commands for
              relatively  comfortable browsing through the ftp directory hierar&#8208;
              chy. The password is echoed!  pty is required to have ftp issue  a
              prompt.   Nevertheless,  there  may  occur some confusion with the
              password and FTP prompts.

              (socat PTY,link=$HOME/dev/vmodem0,raw,echo=0,wait-slave EXEC:&apos;&quot;ssh
              modemserver.us.org socat - /dev/ttyS0,nonblock,raw,echo=0&quot;&apos;)

              generates a pseudo terminal device (PTY) on the client that can be
              reached under the symbolic link $HOME/dev/vmodem0.  An application
              that  expects  a  serial  line  or  modem can be configured to use
              $HOME/dev/vmodem0; its traffic will be directed to  a  modemserver
              via ssh where another socat instance links it with /dev/ttyS0.

       socat TCP4-LISTEN:2022,reuseaddr,fork \
       PROXY:proxy:www.domain.org:22,proxyport=3128,proxyauth=user:pass

              starts  a  forwarder  that  accepts  connections on port 2022, and
              directs them through the  proxy  daemon  listening  on  port  3128
              (proxyport)  on  host  proxy, using the CONNECT method, where they
              are authenticated as &quot;user&quot; with  &quot;pass&quot;  (proxyauth).  The  proxy
              should  establish  connections  to  host www.domain.org on port 22
              then.

       socat - OPENSSL:server:4443,cafile=server.crt,cert=client.pem


              is an OpenSSL client that tries to establish a  secure  connection
              to  an  SSL  server.  Option cafile specifies a file that contains
              trust certificates: we trust the server only when it presents  one
              of  these certificates and proofs that it owns the related private
              key.  Otherwise the connection is terminated.  With  cert  a  file
              containing  the  client certificate and the associated private key
              is specified. This is required in case the server wishes a  client
              authentication; many Internet servers do not.
              The  first address (&apos;-&apos;) can be replaced by almost any other socat
              address.

       socat                                          OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,reuse&#8208;
       addr,pf=ip4,fork,cert=server.pem,cafile=client.crt PIPE


              is  an  OpenSSL  server that accepts TCP connections, presents the
              certificate from the file server.pem  and  forces  the  client  to
              present a certificate that is verified against cafile.crt.
              The  second  address  (&apos;PIPE&apos;) can be replaced by almost any other
              socat address.
              For instructions on generating and distributing OpenSSL  keys  and
              certificates see the additional socat docu socat-openssl.txt.

       echo |socat -u - file:/tmp/bigfile,create,largefile,seek=100000000000


              creates a 100GB sparse file; this requires a file system type that
              supports this (ext2, ext3, reiserfs, jfs; not  minix,  vfat).  The
              operation  of  writing 1 byte might take long (reiserfs: some min&#8208;
              utes; ext2: &quot;no&quot; time), and the resulting file  can  consume  some
              disk space with just its inodes (reiserfs: 2MB; ext2: 16KB).

       socat tcp-l:7777,reuseaddr,fork system:&apos;filan -i 0 -s &gt;&amp;2&apos;,nofork


              listens  for  incoming  TCP  connections  on  port  7777. For each
              accepted connection, invokes a shell. This shell has its stdin and
              stdout  directly  connected to the TCP socket (nofork).  The shell
              starts filan and lets it print  the  socket  addresses  to  stderr
              (your terminal window).

       echo         -en         &apos;\0\14\0\0\c&apos;         |socat         -u        -
       file:/usr/bin/squid.exe,seek=0x00074420


              functions as primitive binary editor: it writes the  4  bytes  000
              014  000 000 to the executable /usr/bin/squid at offset 0x00074420
              (this is a real world patch to make the squid executable from Cyg&#8208;
              win run under Windows, actual per May 2004).

       socat - tcp:www.blackhat.org:31337,readbytes=1000


              connects to an unknown service and prevents being flooded.

       socat -U TCP:target:9999,end-close TCP-L:8888,reuseaddr,fork
&#12;              merges  data  arriving  from different TCP streams on port 8888 to
              just one stream to target:9999. The end-close option prevents  the
              child  processes forked off by the second address from terminating
              the shared connection to 9999 (close\(2) just  unlinks  the  inode
              which  stays  active  as  long  as the parent process lives; shut&#8208;
              down\(2) would actively terminate the connection).

       socat            -            UDP4-DATAGRAM:192.168.1.0:123,sp=123,broad&#8208;
       cast,range=192.168.1.0/24


              sends  a  broadcast to the network 192.168.1.0/24 and receives the
              replies of the timeservers there. Ignores NTP packets  from  hosts
              outside this network.

       socat - SOCKET-DATAGRAM:2:2:17:x007bxc0a80100x0000000000000000,b&#8208;
       ind=x007bx00000000x0000000000000000,setsockopt-int=1:6:1,r&#8208;
       ange=x0000xc0a80100x0000000000000000:x0000xffffff00x0000000000000000

              is semantically equivalent to the previous example, but all param&#8208;
              eters are specified in generic form. the value 6 of setsockopt-int
              is the Linux value for SO_BROADCAST.

       socat - IP4-DATAGRAM:255.255.255.255:44,broadcast,range=10.0.0.0/8


              sends a broadcast to the local network\(s) using protocol 44.
              Accepts replies from the private address range only.

       socat - UDP4-DATAGRAM:224.255.0.1:6666,bind=:6666,ip-add-member&#8208;
       ship=224.255.0.1:eth0


              transfers data from stdin to the specified multicast address using
              UDP. Both local and remote ports are 6666. Tells the interface
              eth0 to also accept multicast packets of the given group. Multiple
              hosts on the local network can run this command, so all data sent
              by any of the hosts will be received by all the other ones. Note
              that there are many possible reasons for failure, including IP-
              filters, routing issues, wrong interface selection by the operat&#8208;
              ing system, bridges, or a badly configured switch.

       socat TCP:host2:4443 TUN:192.168.255.1/24,up


              establishes one side of a virtual (but not private!) network with
              host2 where a similar process might run, with TCP-L and tun
              address 192.168.255.2. They can reach each other using the
              addresses 192.168.255.1 and 192.168.255.2. Substitute the TCP link
              with an SSL connection protected by client and server authentica&#8208;
              tion (see OpenSSL client and server).

       socat PTY,link=/var/run/ppp,raw,echo=0 INTERFACE:hdlc0


              circumvents the problem that pppd requires a serial device and
              thus might not be able to work on a synchronous line that is rep&#8208;
              resented by a network device.  socat creates a PTY to make pppd
              happy, binds to the network interface hdlc0, and can transfer data
              between both devices. Use pppd on device /var/run/ppp then.

       socat -T 1 -d -d TCP-L:10081,reuseaddr,fork,crlf SYSTEM:&quot;echo -e
       \&quot;\\\&quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\\nDocumentType: text/plain\\\n\\\ndate:
       \$\(date\)\\\nserver:\$SOCAT_SOCKADDR:\$SOCAT_SOCKPORT\\\nclient:
       \$SOCAT_PEERADDR:\$SOCAT_PEERPORT\\\n\\\&quot;\&quot;; cat; echo -e
       \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\n\\\&quot;\&quot;&quot;

              creates a simple HTTP echo server: each HTTP client that connects
              gets a valid HTTP reply that contains information about the client
              address and port as it is seen by the server host, the host
              address (which might vary on multihomed servers), and the original
              client request.

       socat -d -d UDP4-RECVFROM:9999,so-broadcast,so-timestamp,ip-pktinfo,ip-
       recverr,ip-recvopts,ip-recvtos,ip-recvttl!!- SYSTEM:&apos;export; sleep 1&apos;
       |grep SOCAT


              waits for an incoming UDP packet on port 9999 and prints the envi&#8208;
              ronment variables provided by socat. On BSD based systems you have
              to replace ip-pktinfo with ip-recvdstaddr,ip-recvif. Especially
              interesting is SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR: it contains the target address of
              the packet which may be a unicast, multicast, or broadcast
              address.




DIAGNOSTICS
       Socat uses a logging mechanism that allows to filter messages by sever&#8208;
       ity. The severities provided are more or less compatible to the appropri&#8208;
       ate syslog priority. With one or up to four occurrences of the -d command
       line option, the lowest priority of messages that are issued can be
       selected. Each message contains a single uppercase character specifying
       the messages severity (one of F, E, W, N, I, or D)

       FATAL: Conditions that require unconditional and immediate program termi&#8208;
              nation.

       ERROR: Conditions that prevent proper program processing. Usually the
              program is terminated (see option -s).

       WARNING:
              Something did not function correctly or is in a state where cor&#8208;
              rect further processing cannot be guaranteed, but might be possi&#8208;
              ble.

       NOTICE:
              Interesting actions of the program, e.g. for supervising socat in
              some kind of server mode.

       INFO:  Description of what the program does, and maybe why it happens.
              Allows to monitor the lifecycles of file descriptors.

       DEBUG: Description of how the program works, all system or library calls
              and their results.


       Log messages can be written to stderr, to a file, or to syslog.

       On exit, socat gives status 0 if it terminated due to EOF or inactivity
       timeout, with a positive value on error, and with a negative value on
       fatal error.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Input variables carry information from the environment to socat, output
       variables are set by socat for use in executed scripts and programs.

       In the output variables beginning with &quot;SOCAT&quot; this prefix is actually
       replaced by the upper case name of the executable or the value of option
       -lp.

       SOCAT_DEFAULT_LISTEN_IP (input)
              (Values 4 or 6) Sets the IP version to be used for listen, recv,
              and recvfrom addresses if no pf (protocol-family) option is given.
              Is overridden by socat options -4 or -6.

       SOCAT_PREFERRED_RESOLVE_IP (input)
              (Values 0, 4, or 6) Sets the IP version to be used when resolving
              target host names when version is not specified by address type,
              option pf (protocol-family), or address format. If name resolution
              does not return a matching entry, the first result (with differing
              IP version) is taken. With value 0, socat always selects the first
              record and its IP version.

       SOCAT_FORK_WAIT (input)
              Specifies the time (seconds) to sleep the parent and child pro&#8208;
              cesses after successful fork\(). Useful for debugging.

       SOCAT_VERSION (output)
              Socat sets this variable to its version string, e.g. &quot;1.7.0.0&quot; for
              released versions or e.g. &quot;1.6.0.1+envvar&quot; for temporary versions;
              can be used in scripts invoked by socat.

       SOCAT_PID (output)
              Socat sets this variable to its process id. In case of fork
              address option, SOCAT_PID gets the child processes id. Forking for
              exec and system does not change SOCAT_PID.

       SOCAT_PPID (output)
              Socat sets this variable to its process id. In case of fork,
              SOCAT_PPID keeps the pid of the master process.

       SOCAT_PEERADDR (output)
              With passive socket addresses (all LISTEN and RECVFROM addresses),
              this variable is set to a string describing the peers socket
              address. Port information is not included.

       SOCAT_PEERPORT (output)
              With appropriate passive socket addresses (TCP, UDP, and SCTP -
              LISTEN and RECVFROM), this variable is set to a string containing
              the number of the peer port.

       SOCAT_SOCKADDR (output)
              With all LISTEN addresses, this variable is set to a string
              describing the local socket address. Port information is not
              included example

       SOCAT_SOCKPORT (output)
              With TCP-LISTEN, UDP-LISTEN, and SCTP-LISTEN addresses, this vari&#8208;
              able is set to the local port.

       SOCAT_TIMESTAMP (output)
              With all RECVFROM addresses where address option so-timestamp is
              applied, socat sets this variable to the resulting timestamp.

       SOCAT_IP_OPTIONS (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              recvopts is applied, socat fills this variable with the IP options
              of the received packet.

       SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              recvdstaddr (BSD) or ip-pktinfo (other platforms) is applied,
              socat sets this variable to the destination address of the
              received packet. This is particularly useful to identify broadcast
              and multicast addressed packets.

       SOCAT_IP_IF (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              recvif (BSD) or ip-pktinfo (other platforms) is applied, socat
              sets this variable to the name of the interface where the packet
              was received.

       SOCAT_IP_LOCADDR (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              pktinfo is applied, socat sets this variable to the address of the
              interface where the packet was received.

       SOCAT_IP_TOS (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              recvtos is applied, socat sets this variable to the TOS (type of
              service) of the received packet.

       SOCAT_IP_TTL (output)
              With all IPv4 based RECVFROM addresses where address option ip-
              recvttl is applied, socat sets this variable to the TTL (time to
              live) of the received packet.

       SOCAT_IPV6_HOPLIMIT (output)
              With all IPv6 based RECVFROM addresses where address option
              ipv6-recvhoplimit is applied, socat sets this variable to the
              hoplimit value of the received packet.

       SOCAT_IPV6_DSTADDR (output)
              With all IPv6 based RECVFROM addresses where address option
              ipv6-recvpktinfo is applied, socat sets this variable to the des&#8208;
              tination address of the received packet.

       SOCAT_IPV6_TCLASS (output)
              With all IPv6 based RECVFROM addresses where address option
              ipv6-recvtclass is applied, socat sets this variable to the trans&#8208;
              fer class of the received packet.

       HOSTNAME (input)
              Is used to determine the hostname for logging (see -lh).

       LOGNAME (input)
              Is used as name for the socks client user name if no socksuser is
              given.
              With options su and su-d, LOGNAME is set to the given user name.

       USER (input)
              Is used as name for the socks client user name if no socksuser is
              given and LOGNAME is empty.
              With options su and su-d, USER is set to the given user name.

       SHELL (output)
              With options su and su-d, SHELL is set to the login shell of the
              given user.

       PATH (output)
              Can be set with option path for exec and system addresses.

       HOME (output)
              With options su and su-d, HOME is set to the home directory of the
              given user.

VERSION
       This man page describes version 1.7.1 of socat.
&#12;BUGS
       Addresses cannot be nested, so a single socat process cannot, e.g., drive
       ssl over socks.

       Address option ftruncate without value uses default 1 instead of 0.

       Verbose modes (-x and/or -v) display line termination characters incon&#8208;
       sistently when address options cr or crnl are used: They show the data
       after conversion in either direction.

       The data transfer blocksize setting (-b) is ignored with address read&#8208;
       line.
