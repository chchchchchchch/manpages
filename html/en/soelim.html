SOELIM(1)                                                              SOELIM(1)



NAME
       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SYNOPSIS
       soelim [-Crtv] [-I dir] [files ...]

       It  is possible to have whitespace between the -I command line option and
       its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form

              .so file

       by the contents of file.  It is useful if files included with .so need to
       be  preprocessed.   Normally, soelim should be invoked with the -s option
       of groff.

       To embed `\&apos; in the file name, write `\\&apos; or `\e&apos;.   To  embed  a  space,
       write  `\ &apos;.   Any  other escape sequence in file makes soelim ignore the
       whole line.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the two
       characters `s&apos; and `o&apos;.  Otherwise, only groff interprets the .so request
       (and soelim ignores it).

OPTIONS
       -C     Recognize .so even when followed by a character other  than  space
              or newline.

       -Idir  This  option may be used to add a directory to the search path for
              files (both those on the command  line  and  those  named  in  .so
              requests).  The search path is initialized with the current direc&#8208;
              tory.  This option may be specified more than once;  the  directo&#8208;
              ries are then searched in the order specified (but before the cur&#8208;
              rent directory).  If you want to make  the  current  directory  be
              read before other directories, add -I. at the appropriate place.

              No  directory  search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       -t     Don&apos;t emit .lf requests but TeX comment lines (starting with  `%&apos;)
              giving the current file and line number.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -&gt; troff -&gt; postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That  is,  files  sourced  with  .so are normally read only by troff (the
       actual formatter).  soelim is not required for troff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must  already  be
       read before the input file passes through the preprocessor.  This is han&#8208;
       dled by soelim:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -&gt; preprocessor -&gt; troff -&gt; postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
