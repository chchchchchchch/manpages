NAME
       sonar - display a sonar scope

SYNOPSIS
       sonar [-ping hosts-or-subnets] [-ping-timeout int] [-delay usecs] [-speed
       ratio] [-sweep-size  ratio]  [-font-size  points]  [-team-a-name  string]
       [-team-b-name  string]  [-team-a-count int] [-team-b-count int] [-no-dns]
       [-no-times] [-no-wobble] [-debug] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       This draws a sonar screen that pings (get it?) the hosts  on  your  local
       network,  and  plots  their distance (response time) from you.  The three
       rings represent ping times of approximately 2.5, 70 and  2,000  millisec&#8208;
       onds respectively.

       Alternately, it can run a simulation that doesn&apos;t involve hosts.

OPTIONS
       sonar understands the following options:

       -ping hosts-or-subnets
               The  list of things to ping, separated by commas or spaces.  Ele&#8208;
               ments of this list may be:

               simulation  Run in simulation mode instead of pinging real hosts.

               hostname    Ping the given host.

               A.B.C.D     Ping the given IP address.

               subnet      Ping the  local  class  C  subnet  (the  nearest  255
                           addresses).

               subnet/NN   Ping  a different-sized local subnet: e.g., subnet/28
                           would ping a 4-bit subnet (the nearest 15 addresses).

               A.B.C.D/NN  Ping an arbitrary other subnet.  The IP address spec&#8208;
                           ifies  the base address, and the part after the slash
                           is how wide the subnet is.  Typical  values  are  /24
                           (for 255 addresses) and /28 (for 15 addresses).

               filename    Ping  the  hosts listed in the given file.  This file
                           can be in the format used by /etc/hosts, or it can be
                           any  file  that has host names as the first or second
                           element on each line.  If you use ssh, try this:

                             sonar -ping $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts

       -ping-timeout int
               The amount of time in milliseconds the program will wait  for  an
               answer to a ping.

       -delay int
               Delay between frames, in microseconds.  Default 20000.

       -speed ratio
               Less than 1 for slower, greater than 1 for faster.  Default 1.

       -sweep-size ratio
               How big the glowing sweep area should be. Default 0.3.

       -font-size points
               How large the text should be.  Default 10 points.
&#12;       -no-wobble
               Keep  the display stationary instead of very slowly wobbling back
               and forth.

       -no-dns Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses to hostnames.

       -no-times
               Do not display ping times beneath the host names.

       -team-a-name string
               In simulation mode, the name of team A.

       -team-b-name string
               In simulation mode, the name of team B.

       -team-a-count int
               In simulation mode, the number of bogies on team A.

       -team-b-count int
               In simulation mode, the number of bogies on team B.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, polygon count, and CPU load.

NOTES
       On most Unix systems, this program must be installed as  setuid  root  in
       order  to ping hosts.  This is because root privileges are needed to cre&#8208;
       ate an ICMP RAW socket.  Privileges are disavowed shortly  after  startup
       (just after connecting to the X server) so this is believed to be safe:
       chown root:root sonar
       chmod u+s sonar
       It is not necessary to make it setuid on MacOS systems, because on MacOS,
       unprivileged programs can ping by using ICMP  DGRAM  sockets  instead  of
       ICMP RAW.

       In  ping-mode, the display is a logarithmic scale, calibrated so that the
       three rings represent ping times of approximately 2.5, 70 and 2,000  mil&#8208;
       liseconds respectively.

       This  means that if any the hosts you are pinging take longer than 2 sec&#8208;
       onds to respond, they won&apos;t show up; and if you are pinging several hosts
       with  very  fast response times, they will all appear close to the center
       of the screen (making their names hard to read.)
