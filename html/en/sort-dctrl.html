SORT-DCTRL(1)                 Debian user&apos;s manual                 SORT-DCTRL(1)



NAME
       sort-dctrl - sort Debian control files

SYNOPSIS
       sort-dctrl [options] [ file ...  ]

       sort-dctrl --copying | --help | --version | -ChV

DESCRIPTION
       The  sort-dctrl program sorts Debian control files according to specified
       criteria.

       A Debian control (dctrl) file is a semistructured  single-table  database
       stored  in  a machine-parseable text file.  Such a database consists of a
       set of records; each record is a mapping from field names to  field  con&#8208;
       tent.   Textually, records are separated by empty lines, while each field
       is encoded as one or more nonempty lines inside a record.  A field starts
       with  its  name, followed by a colon, followed by the field content.  The
       colon must reside on the first line of the field, and the first line must
       start  with  no  whitespace.  Subsequent lines, in contrast, always start
       with linear whitespace (one or more space or tab characters).

       The sort-dctrl program recognizes two field types: string fields and ver&#8208;
       sion  fields.   Version fields act also as numeric fields.  String fields
       are compared according to strict lexicographical octet-by-octet  compari&#8208;
       son,  after  ignoring  any  initial  whitespace after the colon.  Version
       fields are parsed and compared as Debian version numbers.  When comparing
       version  numbers, if a field content does not in fact conform to the ver&#8208;
       sion number syntax, it compares less than any  field  content  that  does
       conform,  and  equal  to  any  other  nonconforming  field  content.  The
       sort-dctrl program assumes all fields are string fields unless told  oth&#8208;
       erwise.

       You  can  specify  arbitrary  number  of  keys  for sorting, using the -k
       option.  The keys are interpreted in a descending order of priority:  the
       first  key  specified  is primary, the second key specified is secondary,
       and so on.  If two records compare equal under the primary key, then they
       are  compared  under the secondary key, and so on.  If no keys are speci&#8208;
       fied, a default key is assumed (the &quot;Package&quot; field with no modifiers).

OPTIONS
       -k keyspec, --key-spec=keyspec
              Specify one or more keys for sorting.  You may specify this option
              any  number  of  times.  The keyspec argument consists of a comma-
              separated list of key specifications.  Each key specification con&#8208;
              sists  of the name of the field that serves as the key, optionally
              followed by a colon and key modifiers.  The  following  key  modi&#8208;
              fiers are supported:

              r      Invert  the  comparison for this key, reversing the sorting
                     order.

              v      Treat this field as a version number field.

              n      Treat this field as numeric, which currently is  synonymous
                     with v.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Output nothing to the standard output stream.  Instead, exit imme&#8208;
              diately after finding the first match.

       -l level, --errorlevel=level
              Set log level to level.  level is one of fatal, important,  infor&#8208;
              mational  and  debug, but the last may not be available, depending
              on the compile-time options.  These categories are given  here  in
              order; every message that is emitted when fatal is in effect, will
              be emitted in the important error level, and so on. The default is
              important.

       -V, --version
              Print out version information.

       -C, --copying
              Print  out  the  copyright license.  This produces much output; be
              sure to redirect or pipe it  somewhere  (such  as  your  favourite
              pager).

       -h, --help
              Print out a help summary.

EXAMPLES
       Here are some sample invocations of the program:

       sort-dctrl /var/lib/dpkg/available
              Output the dpkg available file sorted by the package name.

       sort-dctrl -k Version:v /var/lib/dpkg/available
              Output  the  dpkg available file sorted in ascending order of ver&#8208;
              sion numbers.

       sort-dctrl -k Version:vr /var/lib/dpkg/available
              Output the dpkg available file sorted in descending order of  ver&#8208;
              sion numbers.

       sort-dctrl -k Package,Version:v /var/lib/dpkg/available
              Output the dpkg available file sorted primarily in ascending order
              of package names and secondarily in descending  order  of  version
              numbers.

       sort-dctrl -k Installed-Size:n,Size:nr /var/lib/dpkg/available
              Output the dpkg available file sorted primarily in ascending order
              of installation sizes and secondarily in descending order of pack&#8208;
              age sizes.
