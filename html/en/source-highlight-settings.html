NAME
       Source-highlight-settings  - utility that can be used to write a configu&#8208;
       ration file for GNU Source-highlight (and its library)

SYNOPSIS
       source-highlight-settings

DESCRIPTION
       Since  version  3.0,  GNU  Source-highlight  includes  also  the  utility
       source-highlight-settings,   which   can   be   used   to  check  whether
       source-highlight will be able to find its language definition files,  and
       other  configuration files, and in case, to store the correct settings in
       a configuration file, in the user home directory.

       In particular, the stored configuration file will be called  source-high&#8208;
       light.conf and will be stored in $HOME/.source-highlight/.

       For  the  moment,  this  file  only  stores  the  default  value  for the
       --data-dir option.

       This utility is part of GNU Source-highlight, maintained by:
