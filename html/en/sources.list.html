SOURCES.LIST(5)                        APT                       SOURCES.LIST(5)



NAME
       sources.list - List of configured APT data sources

DESCRIPTION
       The source list /etc/apt/sources.list is designed to support any number
       of active sources and a variety of source media. The file lists one
       source per line, with the most preferred source listed first. The
       information available from the configured sources is acquired by apt-get
       update (or by an equivalent command from another APT front-end).

       Each line specifying a source starts with type (e.g.  deb-src) followed
       by options and arguments for this type. Individual entries cannot be
       continued onto a following line. Empty lines are ignored, and a #
       character anywhere on a line marks the remainder of that line as a
       comment.

SOURCES.LIST.D
       The /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add sources.list
       entries in separate files. The format is the same as for the regular
       sources.list file. File names need to end with .list and may only contain
       letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-) and
       period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has
       ignored a file, unless that file matches a pattern in the
       Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which case it will be
       silently ignored.

THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES
       The deb type references a typical two-level Debian archive,
       distribution/component. The distribution is generally an archive name
       like stable or testing or a codename like wheezy or jessie while
       component is one of main, contrib or non-free. The deb-src type
       references a Debian distribution&apos;s source code in the same form as the
       deb type. A deb-src line is required to fetch source indexes.

       The format for a sources.list entry using the deb and deb-src types is:

           deb [ options ] uri distribution [component1] [component2] [...]

       The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian
       distribution, from which APT will find the information it needs.
       distribution can specify an exact path, in which case the components must
       be omitted and distribution must end with a slash (/). This is useful for
       the case when only a particular sub-section of the archive denoted by the
       URI is of interest. If distribution does not specify an exact path, at
       least one component must be present.

       distribution may also contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the
       Debian architecture (such as amd64 or armel) used on the system. This
       permits architecture-independent sources.list files to be used. In
       general this is only of interest when specifying an exact path, APT will
       automatically generate a URI with the current architecture otherwise.

       Since only one distribution can be specified per line it may be necessary
       to have multiple lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available
       distributions or components at that location is desired. APT will sort
       the URI list after it has generated a complete set internally, and will
       collapse multiple references to the same Internet host, for instance,
       into a single connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish an
       FTP connection, close it, do something else, and then re-establish a
       connection to that same host. This feature is useful for accessing busy
       FTP sites with limits on the number of simultaneous anonymous users. APT
       also parallelizes connections to different hosts to more effectively deal
       with sites with low bandwidth.

       options is always optional and needs to be surrounded by square brackets.
       It can consist of multiple settings in the form setting=value. Multiple
       settings are separated by spaces. The following settings are supported by
       APT (note however that unsupported settings will be ignored silently):

       &#183;   arch=arch1,arch2,...  can be used to specify for which architectures
           information should be downloaded. If this option is not set all
           architectures defined by the APT::Architectures option will be
           downloaded.

       &#183;   trusted=yes can be set to indicate that packages from this source are
           always authenticated even if the Release file is not signed or the
           signature can&apos;t be checked. This disables parts of apt-secure(8) and
           should therefore only be used in a local and trusted context.
           trusted=no is the opposite which handles even correctly authenticated
           sources as not authenticated.

       It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most
       preferred source listed first. Typically this will result in sorting by
       speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by hosts on a local
       network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example).

       Some examples:

           deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
           deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free


URI SPECIFICATION
       The currently recognized URI types are:

       file
           The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file system to
           be considered an archive. This is useful for NFS mounts and local
           mirrors or archives.

       cdrom
           The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CD-ROM drive with media
           swapping. Use the apt-cdrom(8) program to create cdrom entries in the
           source list.

       http
           The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for the archive. If an
           environment variable http_proxy is set with the format
           http://server:port/, the proxy server specified in http_proxy will be
           used. Users of authenticated HTTP/1.1 proxies may use a string of the
           format http://user:pass@server:port/. Note that this is an insecure
           method of authentication.

       ftp
           The ftp scheme specifies an FTP server for the archive. APT&apos;s FTP
           behavior is highly configurable; for more information see the
           apt.conf(5) manual page. Please note that an FTP proxy can be
           specified by using the ftp_proxy environment variable. It is possible
           to specify an HTTP proxy (HTTP proxy servers often understand FTP
           URLs) using this environment variable and only this environment
           variable. Proxies using HTTP specified in the configuration file will
           be ignored.

       copy
           The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except that packages
           are copied into the cache directory instead of used directly at their
           location. This is useful for people using removable media to copy
           files around with APT.

       rsh, ssh
           The rsh/ssh method invokes RSH/SSH to connect to a remote host and
           access the files as a given user. Prior configuration of rhosts or
           RSA keys is recommended. The standard find and dd commands are used
           to perform the file transfers from the remote host.

       adding more recognizable URI types
           APT can be extended with more methods shipped in other optional
           packages, which should follow the naming scheme apt-transport-method.
           For instance, the APT team also maintains the package
           apt-transport-https, which provides access methods for HTTPS URIs
           with features similar to the http method. Methods for using e.g.
           debtorrent are also available - see apt-transport-debtorrent(1).

EXAMPLES
       Uses the archive stored locally (or NFS mounted) at /home/jason/debian
       for stable/main, stable/contrib, and stable/non-free.

           deb file:/home/jason/debian stable main contrib non-free

       As above, except this uses the unstable (development) distribution.

           deb file:/home/jason/debian unstable main contrib non-free

       Source line for the above

           deb-src file:/home/jason/debian unstable main contrib non-free

       The first line gets package information for the architectures in
       APT::Architectures while the second always retrieves amd64 and armel.

           deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main
           deb [ arch=amd64,armel ] http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main

       Uses HTTP to access the archive at archive.debian.org, and uses only the
       hamm/main area.

           deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive hamm main

       Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp.debian.org, under the debian
       directory, and uses only the wheezy/contrib area.

           deb ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy contrib

       Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp.debian.org, under the debian
       directory, and uses only the unstable/contrib area. If this line appears
       as well as the one in the previous example in sources.list a single FTP
       session will be used for both resource lines.

           deb ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable contrib

       Uses HTTP to access the archive at ftp.tlh.debian.org, under the universe
       directory, and uses only files found under unstable/binary-i386 on i386
       machines, unstable/binary-amd64 on amd64, and so forth for other
       supported architectures. [Note this example only illustrates how to use
       the substitution variable; official debian archives are not structured
       like this]

           deb http://ftp.tlh.debian.org/universe unstable/binary-$(ARCH)/
