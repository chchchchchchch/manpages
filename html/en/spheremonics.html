NAME
       spheremonics - 3d spherical harmonic shapes.

SYNOPSIS
       spheremonics  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-visual visual] [-window]
       [-root] [-delay number] [-duration number] [-resolution number] [-wander]
       [-no-spin]  [-spin  [XYZ]]  [-wireframe]  [-no-smooth] [-no-grid] [-bbox]
       [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       These closed objects are commonly called  spherical  harmonics,  although
       they  are  only  remotely related to the mathematical definition found in
       the solution to certain wave functions, most notable  the  eigenfunctions
       of angular momentum operators.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a  specific  vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame  delay,  in  microseconds.   Default:  30000 (0.03 sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -duration number
               Duration.  5 - 1000.  Default: 100.

       -resolution number
               Resolution.  5 - 100.  Default: 64.

       -wander | -no-wander
               Whether the object should wander around the screen.

       -spin [XYZ]
               Around which axes should the object spin?

       -no-spin
               Don&apos;t spin.

       -wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -smooth | -no-smooth
               Smoothed Lines.  Boolean.

       -grid | -no-grid
               Draw Grid.  Boolean.

       -bbox | -no-bbox
               Draw Bounding Box.  Boolean.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
