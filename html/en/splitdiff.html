SPLITDIFF(1)                        Man pages                       SPLITDIFF(1)



NAME
       splitdiff - separate out incremental patches

SYNOPSIS
       splitdiff [-a] [-d] [-p n] [file]

       splitdiff {[--help] | [--version]}

DESCRIPTION
       If you have a patch file composed of several incremental patches, you can
       use splitdiff to separate them out. You may want to do this in
       preparation for re-combining them with combinediff(1).

       The effect of running splitdiff is to separate its input into a set of
       output files, with no output file patching the same file more than once.

OPTIONS
       -a
           Split out every single file-level patch.

       -d
           Create file names such as a_b.c for a patch that modifies a/b.c.

       -p n
           Strip the first n components of the pathname to aid comparisons.

       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
           Display the version number of splitdiff.
