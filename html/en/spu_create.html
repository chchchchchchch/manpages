SPU_CREATE(2)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              SPU_CREATE(2)



NAME
       spu_create - create a new spu context

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/spu.h&gt;

       int spu_create(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
       int spu_create(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode,
                      int neighbor_fd);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The  spu_create()  system call is used on PowerPC machines that implement
       the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture in  order  to  access  Synergistic
       Processor  Units  (SPUs).  It creates a new logical context for an SPU in
       pathname and returns a file descriptor associated with it.  pathname must
       refer  to a nonexistent directory in the mount point of the SPU file sys&#8208;
       tem (spufs).  If spu_create() is successful, a directory  is  created  at
       pathname and it is populated with the files described in spufs(7).

       When  a  context  is  created,  the  returned file descriptor can only be
       passed to spu_run(2), used as the dirfd argument to  the  *at  family  of
       system  calls  (e.g.,  openat(2)),  or  closed;  other operations are not
       defined.  A logical SPU context is destroyed (along with all  files  cre&#8208;
       ated  within the context&apos;s pathname directory) once the last reference to
       the context has gone;  this  usually  occurs  when  the  file  descriptor
       returned by spu_create() is closed.

       The  flags  argument  can be zero or any bitwise OR-ed combination of the
       following constants:

       SPU_CREATE_EVENTS_ENABLED
              Rather than using signals for reporting DMA errors, use the  event
              argument to spu_run(2).

       SPU_CREATE_GANG
              Create  an  SPU  gang instead of a context.  (A gang is a group of
              SPU contexts that are functionally related to each other and which
              share  common  scheduling  parameters&#8212;priority and policy.  In the
              future, gang scheduling may be implemented causing the group to be
              switched in and out as a single unit.)

              A  new  directory will be created at the location specified by the
              pathname argument.  This gang may be used to hold other  SPU  con&#8208;
              texts,  by  providing a pathname that is within the gang directory
              to further calls to spu_create().

       SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED
              Create a context that is not affected by the SPU scheduler.   Once
              the  context  is  run,  it  will  not be scheduled out until it is
              destroyed by the creating process.

              Because the context cannot be removed from the SPU, some function&#8208;
              ality  is disabled for SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED contexts.  Only a subset
              of the files will be available in this context directory in spufs.
              Additionally,  SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED contexts cannot dump a core file
              when crashing.

              Creating SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED  contexts  requires  the  CAP_SYS_NICE
              capability.

       SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE
              Create  an  isolated SPU context.  Isolated contexts are protected
              from some PPE (PowerPC Processing  Element)  operations,  such  as
              access to the SPU local store and the NPC register.

              Creating  SPU_CREATE_ISOLATE  contexts  also requires the SPU_CRE&#8208;
              ATE_NOSCHED flag.

       SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_SPU
              Create a context with  affinity  to  another  SPU  context.   This
              affinity  information is used within the SPU scheduling algorithm.
              Using this flag requires that a file descriptor referring  to  the
              other SPU context be passed in the neighbor_fd argument.

       SPU_CREATE_AFFINITY_MEM
              Create  a  context  with affinity to system memory.  This affinity
              information is used within the SPU scheduling algorithm.

       The mode argument (minus any bits set in the process&apos;s  umask(2))  speci&#8208;
       fies  the  permissions used for creating the new directory in spufs.  See
       stat(2) for a full list of the possible mode values.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, spu_create() returns a new file descriptor.  On error, -1  is
       returned, and errno is set to one of the error codes listed below.

ERRORS
       EACCES The  current user does not have write access to the spufs(7) mount
              point.

       EEXIST An SPU context already exists at the given path name.

       EFAULT pathname is not a valid string pointer in  the  calling  process&apos;s
              address space.

       EINVAL pathname  is  not  a  directory  in  the  spufs(7) mount point, or
              invalid flags have been provided.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were found while resolving pathname.

       EMFILE The process has reached its maximum open files limit.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname is too long.

       ENFILE The system has reached the global open files limit.

       ENODEV An isolated context was requested, but the hardware does not  sup&#8208;
              port SPU isolation.

       ENOENT Part of pathname could not be resolved.

       ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate all resources required.

       ENOSPC There  are not enough SPU resources available to create a new con&#8208;
              text or the user-specific limit for the number of SPU contexts has
              been reached.

       ENOSYS The  functionality  is not provided by the current system, because
              either the hardware does not provide SPUs or the spufs  module  is
              not loaded.

       ENOTDIR
              A part of pathname is not a directory.
&#12;       EPERM  The  SPU_CREATE_NOSCHED flag has been given, but the user does not
              have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability.

FILES
       pathname must point to a location beneath the mount point of  spufs.   By
       convention, it gets mounted in /spu.

VERSIONS
       The spu_create() system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.

CONFORMING TO
       This call is Linux-specific and only implemented on the PowerPC architec&#8208;
       ture.  Programs using this system call are not portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this  system  call;  call  it  using
       syscall(2).   Note  however,  that  spu_create() is meant to be used from
       libraries that implement a more abstract interface to  SPUs,  not  to  be
       used   from   regular   applications.    See  &#10216;http://www.bsc.es/projects
       /deepcomputing/linuxoncell/&#10217; for the recommended libraries.
