SPUMUX(1)                      DVDAuthor Man Pages                     SPUMUX(1)



NAME
       spumux  - generates and multiplexes subtitles into an existing mpeg2 pro&#8208;
       gram stream

SYNOPSIS
       spumux [ -m dvd | -m cvd | -m svcd ] [ -s stream ] [ -v level ] [ -P ]  [
       --nomux ] [ --nodvdauthor-data ] file &lt; mpeg &gt; mpeg-with-subtitles


DESCRIPTION
       spumux  encodes  the  subtitles and multiplexes it into the mpeg2 program
       stream.

       -m mode
              Sets the encoding for the subtitles.  Can be dvd,  cvd,  or  svcd.
              Default is dvd.

       -s stream
              Sets the subtitle stream id.  Default is 0.

       -v level
              Sets the verbosity level.

       -P     Enables a progress bar.

       --nomux
              Disables  reading  of an MPEG stream from standard input. Instead,
              the output will contain only the subpicture stream.

       --nodvdauthor-data
              Disables passing of color and button info to dvdauthor.

       Here&apos;s a sample configuration file:

       &lt;subpictures&gt;
          &lt;stream&gt;
             &lt;spu start=&quot;start-time&quot; [ end=&quot;end-time&quot; ] [ image=&quot;picture.png&quot; ]
                  [ highlight=&quot;picture.png&quot; ] [ select=&quot;picture.png&quot; ]
                  [ transparent=&quot;color-spec&quot; ] [ force=&quot;yes&quot; ]
                  [ autooutline=&quot;infer&quot; [ outlinewidth=&quot;width&quot; ]
                    [ autoorder=&quot;rows&quot; | autoorder=&quot;columns&quot; ] ]
                  [ xoffset=&quot;x-coord&quot; yoffset=&quot;y-coord&quot; ] &gt;
                &lt;button [ name=&quot;name&quot; ] [ x0=&quot;x0&quot; ] [ y0=&quot;y0&quot; ] [ x1=&quot;x1&quot; ]
                        [ y1=&quot;y1&quot; ] [ up=&quot;name&quot; ] [ down=&quot;name&quot; ]
                        [ left=&quot;name&quot; ] [ right=&quot;name&quot; ] /&gt;
                &lt;action [ name=&quot;name&quot; ] [ x0=&quot;x0&quot; ] [ y0=&quot;y0&quot; ] [ x1=&quot;x1&quot; ]
                        [ y1=&quot;y1&quot; ] /&gt;
             &lt;/spu&gt;
          &lt;/stream&gt;
       &lt;/subpictures&gt;

       Each subtitle image is described by an &lt;spu&gt; tag.  The start and optional
       end  attributes  describe  when  the  subtitle  will  be displayed on the
       screen, in &quot;HR:MM:SS.HU&quot;.  The image attribute describes the main  subti&#8208;
       tle image, which can either be a PNG or BMP file.  If your image is not a
       full screen image, you can use xoffset and yoffset to  move  the  picture
       around.  In the advent that the author is unable to use a graphics format
       with an alpha channel, then the transparent  attribute  can  be  used  to
       describe which color should become fully transparent.  For the valid for&#8208;
       mats for color-spec, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.  If you want  to  force
       the  display  of the subtitle, regardless of whether the user has enabled
       subtitles or not, you can use the force tag.  When you are making  menus,
       the force tag is required.

       The  remaining  attributes  and  tags  are related to menu creation.  The
       highlight attribute shows what all the buttons look like  when  they  are
       highlighted  (i.e.  when  you  are using the arrows in the menu), and the
       select attribute shows what all  the  buttons  look  like  when  the  are
       selected  (i.e.  for  the 1-2 seconds after you press enter in the menu).
       If either of these (or the image attribute) are omitted, then spumux cre&#8208;
       ates  a  blank  (totally  transparent) image.  Obviously at least one tag
       should be specified.

       To aid in button creation, the autooutline attribute instructs spumux  to
       infer  where the buttons are located.  It does this by attempting to draw
       rectangles around a composition of the highlight and select images  which
       do  not  intersect any opaque or semi-opaque pixels.  In order to support
       textual buttons, the attribute outlinewidth allows  you  to  specify  the
       width  of  the rectangle which is tested.  Wider rectangles won&apos;t be able
       to squeeze between the letters.  Finally, autoorder describes  which  way
       to  order  the  automatically  detected  buttons,  which is important for
       numerically selected buttons and for mapping buttons to button  names  or
       to the implied names.

       The  button  and  action  tags  describe  the buttons (visibly selectable
       objects on the screen) and actions (commands that are executed as soon as
       the  associated  key  is  pressed  on  the remote).  If you are using the
       autooutline feature, just designing buttons, are happy with the  inferred
       button  navigation,  and can deal with the simplistic naming system, then
       you actually do not even need to specify any buttons or actions.   Other&#8208;
       wise, read on.

       The name attribute is used to give a button or action an easy to refer to
       name.  By default they are numbered sequentially starting with &quot;1&quot;.   The
       up, down, left, and right names describe which button or action should be
       tied to the corresponding key when the  current  button  is  highlighted,
       though  if  omitted spumux will use a reasonably intelligent algorithm to
       determine which buttons to move to.

       The (x0,y0) coordinates describe the upper left hand corner  inclusively,
       while the (x1,y1) coordinates describe the lower right hand corner EXclu&#8208;
       sively.  The coordinates start at 0,0 for the  upper  left  hand  corner.
       Ideally,  the  y0  and  y1 coordinates should both be even, so the button
       edges fully empasses two interlaced scanlines, even if there is  no  data
       in  the extra scanline.  Some DVD players will fill in the extra scanline
       if it is not specified; spumux makes an effort to  ensure  that  will  be
       transparent but there is no guarantee.

HANDLING TEXT-BASED SUBTITLES
       Spumux  is  also able to handle text subtitles, which will be rendered to
       graphics by spumux. A lot of different text (must be non-graphic) formats
       are supported (.sub, .srt, .ssa, .smi, .rt , .txt, .aqt, .jss, .js, ass).
       Spumux will try to determine the format automatically.

       If processing text-based subtitles no other streams can be defined,  but&#8208;
       tons  or  others  need to be processed in another pass with spumux, using
       another xml file.

       Following .xml file shows the available tags and their default  settings.
       Only  the textsub tag is mandatory, defaults are used if the specific tag
       is not specified.

       &lt;subpictures [format=&quot;NTSC|PAL&quot;]&gt;
          &lt;stream&gt;
             &lt;textsub filename=&quot;demo1.srt&quot; characterset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;
                fontsize=&quot;28.0&quot; font=&quot;arial&quot; fill-color=&quot;color-spec&quot;
                outline-color=&quot;color-spec&quot; outline-thickness=&quot;3.0&quot;
                shadow-offset=&quot;0, 0&quot; shadow-color=&quot;color-spec&quot;
                horizontal-alignment=&quot;left&quot;  vertical-alignment=&quot;bottom&quot;
                left-margin=&quot;60&quot; right-margin=&quot;60&quot;
                top-margin=&quot;20&quot; bottom-margin=&quot;30&quot; subtitle-fps=&quot;fps&quot;
                movie-fps=&quot;fps&quot;
                movie-width=&quot;720&quot; movie-height=&quot;height&quot; aspect=&quot;4:3&quot;
                force=&quot;yes&quot;
             /&gt;
          &lt;/stream&gt;
       &lt;/subpictures&gt;

       The textsub tag defines the settings for the text to graphics rendering.

       The filename attribute defines the path and name of the input text subti&#8208;
       tle file, this is the only attribute that is mandatory.

       The characterset attribute defines the characterset to be used, available
       charactersets can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv.

       The fontsize attribute defines the size of the font in font  units.   The
       font  attribute  defines  the  font used. Spumux will match the font name
       using Fontconfig if available, else it will use it as a filename on linux
       systems  and  will look into the windows/fonts and subdirectory spumux of
       the cygwin/mingw home directory and into the execution directory for win&#8208;
       dows-based  execution for the specified font. Looking for free fonts? One
       listing         is         here         http://www.microsoft.com/typogra&#8208;
       phy/links/links.asp?type=free&amp;part=1 (this is only about fonts, not about
       operating systems).

       The fill-color attribute specifies the color to be used for  filling  the
       interior  of  the  text,  while outline-color specifies the color for the
       outline border to draw around each character, to  set  it  off  from  the
       video  background.   The outline-thickness attribute specifies the thick&#8208;
       ness of this outline. For the valid formats for color-spec, see  SPECIFY&#8208;
       ING  COLORS  below.  The default fill color is white and the default out&#8208;
       line color is black.

       The shadow-offset and shadow-color attributes specify a shadow effect  to
       be  applied to the text. The shadow-offset is specified as 2 signed inte&#8208;
       gers, being the horizontal and vertical offset respectively,  with  posi&#8208;
       tive values being to the right and down. For the valid formats for color-
       spec, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.  The default shadow color is black.

       The horizontal-alignment attribute defines the  horizontal  alignment  of
       the subtitles. Options are: &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;center&quot; and &quot;default&quot;.  The
       &quot;default&quot; value causes spumux to use the attribute that is  in  the  text
       subtitle file if the format supports such an attribute.

       The vertical-alignment attribute defines the vertical alignment.  Options
       are: &quot;top&quot;, &quot;center&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot;.

       The margin attributes define the minimum blank pixel  space  between  the
       border of the image and the border of the subtitle lines.

       The  subtitle-fps  is needed for subtitle formats which use frame numbers
       rather than fractional seconds for specifying subtitle times,  while  the
       movie-fps  is  the  frame  rate of the movie onto which the subtitles are
       being multiplexed; if omitted, both of these default to  29.97  for  NTSC
       and 25 for PAL.

       Having  separate  subtitle-fps  and movie-fps attributes make it possible
       for spumux to recalculate the subtitle timing if these are not the same.

       The movie-width and movie-height attributes define the  maximum  size  of
       the  subtitle  page, these shouldn&apos;t be larger than the size of the video
       frame (720x480 for NTSC, 720x576 for PAL), normally they  are  the  same.
       Some DVD players prefer subtitle frames that are 2 or 4 pixels smaller in
       height.  If omitted, the default movie width is 720 and the height  is  2
       pixels less than the video frame height.

       The  aspect  attribute lets you specify whether the video aspect ratio is
       16:9 (widescreen) or 4:3. This, together with the video format,  is  used
       to adjust the rendering of the text to ensure it appears undistorted.

       The force option allows you to force the display of the subtitle, regard&#8208;
       less of whether the user has enabled subtitles or not.

SPECIFYING COLORS
       Colors for image transparency and text fill and outlines can be specified
       in a number of ways:

       &#183; As  a  color  name,  e.g.  &quot;green&quot;. You can use most of the color names
         listed at &lt;http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php&gt;.

       &#183; As a hexadecimal string preceded by a &quot;#&quot;, similar to HTML format, e.g.
         &quot;#FF8080&quot;.  The  number  of  digits  must be a multiple of 3; the first
         group specifies the red component, the  second  green,  and  the  third
         blue.

       &#183; As  the name of a color space, followed by one to four component values
         in parentheses, e.g. &quot;hsv(120, 50%, 90%)&quot;.

       Valid color spaces are &quot;gray&quot;  (1  component),  &quot;graya&quot;  (2  components),
       &quot;hsl&quot; (3 components), &quot;hsla&quot; (4 components), &quot;hsv&quot; (3 components), &quot;hsva&quot;
       (4 components), &quot;rgb&quot; (3 components) and &quot;rgba&quot; (4 components). Each com&#8208;
       ponent  can be specified as either a percentage of the maximum value suf&#8208;
       fixed by &quot;%&quot;, or an absolute value in the range 0-360 for hues, 0-255 for
       everything  else.  For color space names ending with &quot;a&quot;, the last compo&#8208;
       nent is the alpha (transparency) value.

       Note that alpha values are meaningless for the &quot;transparent&quot; attribute on
       the  &lt;spu&gt; tag above.  &lt;marc.leeman@gmail.com&gt; MarcLeeman2003Marc Leeman&#8208;
