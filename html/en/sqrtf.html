SQRT(3)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    SQRT(3)



NAME
       sqrt, sqrtf, sqrtl - square root function

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double sqrt(double x);
       float sqrtf(float x);
       long double sqrtl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sqrtf(), sqrtl():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
           || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The sqrt() function returns the nonnegative square root of x.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the square root of x.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is less than -0, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine  whether  an  error
       has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x less than -0
              errno  is  set  to  EDOM.   An  invalid  floating-point  exception
              (FE_INVALID) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms  to  SVr4,
       4.3BSD, C89.
