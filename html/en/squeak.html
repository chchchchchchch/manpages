NAME
       squeak - Unix Squeak virtual machine launcher

SYNOPSIS
       squeak squeak [image filename]  [project filename]

DESCRIPTION
       squeak  is  the  virtual  machine  for  the  Squeak Smalltalk system.  It
       requires three files to operate correctly: an  image  file  containing  a
       `snapshot&apos; of a live Squeak session, a changes file containing the source
       code for modified methods in the image, and a copy of (or a  link  to)  a
       shared  system  sources  file containing the source code for methods that
       have not been modified since the last major version increment.

       The image and changes files contain the state of a user&apos;s Squeak session,
       which  is  persistent  between  consecutive  sessions.  Private copies of
       these files are therefore normally required.  The  squeak  script  checks
       that  the  local  Squeak  installation  appears sane, and then copies the
       required files to the current working directory.  If squeak encounters no
       problems,  it  will finish by running squeak vm to start a Squeak session
       using the newly copied image and changes files.

INVOCATION
       squeak accepts  an optional image name, and/or an optional project  name.
       If  an  image  name is given on the command line then squeak tries to run
       that  image.   Otherwise   squeak   checks   the   environment   variable
       SQUEAK_IMAGE  and,  if it is set, uses its value as the name of the image
       to run.  Otherwise squeak looks for available images in the ~/squeak  and
       /usr/share/squeak  directories.  Then, squeak shows a dialog with all the
       available images for the user to choose one of them. If the chosen  image
       is  at  SQUEAK_IMAGE_DIR (which is by default /usr/share/squeak), it will
       be copied to  ~/squeak.  If only one image is available, no  dialog  will
       be shown and the script will run that image.

       The  image  argument can be followed by a project name.  This is the name
       of a &apos;document&apos; that should have been saved  from  a  Squeak  image.  The
       project name must have the &apos;.pr&apos; extension.

       The  project argument can also be providen without an image name. In that
       case, squeak will look for an image to run the project following the same
       criteria explained above.

ENVIRONMENT
       To  know  all  the environment variables that can affect the squeak image
       launching, take a look at the Environment section  of  the  squeakvm  man
       page.

       Appart from those options, these are applied to this script:



       SQUEAK_IMAGE_DIR
              is  the directory, together with ~/squeak where the launcher looks
              for Squeak images.  (The default value is /usr/share/squeak)

       SQUEAK_IMAGE
              is the name of a image file to be run by the script.

       SQUEAK is the name of an alternative vm (or alternative vm options) to be
              run  by  the script. The script launches the vm with these default
              options: &apos;-mmap 1024M -nomixer&apos;
&#12;NOTES
       This manual page documents version [version] of Unix Squeak.  It may  not
       be appropriate for any other version.

       The  image  and changes files containing a saved Squeak session are inti&#8208;
       mately related.  They should always be used together, never be separated,
       and  under  no  circumstances  should an image be run with a changes file
       that has been used with a different image.   Failure  to  adhere  to  the
       above  could cause the source code for the methods in the image to become
       garbled and impossible to retrieve.

       The Unix Squeak virtual machine fully supports OpenGL in both the X11 and
       Quartz  display  drivers.  Open Croquet will run just fine with either of
       these drivers (and many Mac OS X users will even have the choice of which
       driver to use :).

       Because  of licensing issues, a Squeak image or Squeak sources package is
       not available in Debian yet. So the user must download a proper image  in
       order  to get this script useful.  Available images can be found in these
       web sites:
