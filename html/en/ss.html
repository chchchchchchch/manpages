SS(8)                                                                      SS(8)



NAME
       ss - another utility to investigate sockets

SYNOPSIS
       ss [options] [ FILTER ]

DESCRIPTION
       ss is used to dump socket statistics. It allows showing information simi&#8208;
       lar to netstat.  It can display more  TCP  and  state  informations  than
       other tools.


OPTIONS
       When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening TCP sock&#8208;
       ets that have established connection.

       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
              options starting with two dashes (`-&apos;).  A summary of  options  is
              included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Output version information.

       -n, --numeric
              Do not try to resolve service names.

       -r, --resolve
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       -a, --all
              Display  both  listening  and  non-listening  (for  TCP this means
              established connections) sockets.

       -l, --listening
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by default).

       -o, --options
              Show timer information.

       -e, --extended
              Show detailed socket information

       -m, --memory
              Show socket memory usage.

       -p, --processes
              Show process using socket.

       -i, --info
              Show internal TCP information.

       -s, --summary
              Print summary statistics. This option does not parse socket  lists
              obtaining  summary  from various sources. It is useful when amount
              of sockets is so huge that parsing /proc/net/tcp is painful.

       -4, --ipv4
              Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).
&#12;       -6, --ipv6
              Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

       -0, --packet
              Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

       -t, --tcp
              Display TCP sockets.

       -u, --udp
              Display UDP sockets.

       -d, --dccp
              Display DCCP sockets.

       -w, --raw
              Display RAW sockets.

       -x, --unix
              Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

       -f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY
              Display sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following  families
              are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink.

       -A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY
              List  of socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The following
              identifiers are  understood:  all,  inet,  tcp,  udp,  raw,  unix,
              packet,     netlink,    unix_dgram,    unix_stream,    packet_raw,
              packet_dgram.

       -D FILE, --diag=FILE
              Do not display anything, just dump raw information about TCP sock&#8208;
              ets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is - stdout is used.

       -F FILE, --filter=FILE
              Read  filter  information  from FILE.  Each line of FILE is inter&#8208;
              preted like single command line option. If  FILE  is  -  stdin  is
              used.

       FILTER := [ state TCP-STATE ] [ EXPRESSION ]
              Please  take  a look at the official documentation (Debian package
              iproute-doc) for details regarding filters.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       ss -t -a
              Display all TCP sockets.

       ss -u -a
              Display all UDP sockets.

       ss -o state established &apos;( dport = :ssh or sport = :ssh )&apos;
              Display all established ssh connections.

       ss -x src /tmp/.X11-unix/*
              Find all local processes connected to X server.

       ss -o state fin-wait-1 &apos;(  sport  =  :http  or  sport  =  :https  )&apos;  dst
       193.233.7/24
              List  all  the  tcp  sockets in state FIN-WAIT-1 for our apache to
              network 193.233.7/24 and look at their timers.
