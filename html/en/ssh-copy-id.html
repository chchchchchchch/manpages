SSH-COPY-ID(1)                                                    SSH-COPY-ID(1)



NAME
       ssh-copy-id  -  install  your  public  key  in  a remote machine&apos;s autho&#8208;
       rized_keys

SYNOPSIS
       ssh-copy-id [-i [identity_file]] [user@]machine

DESCRIPTION
       ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh to log into a  remote  machine  and
       append  the  indicated  identity  file  to  that  machine&apos;s ~/.ssh/autho&#8208;
       rized_keys file.

       If  the  -i  option  is  given  then  the  identity  file  (defaults   to
       ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)  is  used, regardless of whether there are any keys in
       your ssh-agent.  Otherwise, if this:

             ssh-add -L

       provides any output, it uses that in preference to the identity file.

       If the -i option is used, or the ssh-add produced no output, then it uses
       the  contents of the identity file.  Once it has one or more fingerprints
       (by whatever means) it uses ssh to append them to  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
       on the remote machine (creating the file, and directory, if necessary.)


NOTES
       This program does not modify the permissions of any pre-existing files or
       directories. Therefore, if the remote sshd has  StrictModes  set  in  its
       configuration,  then  the  user&apos;s  home, ~/.ssh folder, and ~/.ssh/autho&#8208;
       rized_keys file may need to have  group  writability  disabled  manually,
       e.g. via

             chmod go-w ~ ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

       on the remote machine.
