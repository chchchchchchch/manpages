SSH-KEYSIGN(8)            BSD System Manager&apos;s Manual           SSH-KEYSIGN(8)

NAME
     ssh-keysign &#8212; ssh helper program for host-based authentication

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-keysign

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-keysign is used by ssh(1) to access the local host keys and generate
     the digital signature required during host-based authentication with SSH
     protocol version 2.

     ssh-keysign is disabled by default and can only be enabled in the global
     client configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config by setting EnableSSHKeysign
     to &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     ssh-keysign is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from ssh(1).
     See ssh(1) and sshd(8) for more information about host-based authentica&#8208;
     tion.

FILES
     /etc/ssh/ssh_config
             Controls whether ssh-keysign is enabled.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
             These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to gen&#8208;
             erate the digital signature.  They should be owned by root, read&#8208;
             able only by root, and not accessible to others.  Since they are
             readable only by root, ssh-keysign must be set-uid root if host-
             based authentication is used.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key-cert.pub
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub
             If these files exist they are assumed to contain public certificate
             information corresponding with the private keys above.

HISTORY
     ssh-keysign first appeared in OpenBSD 3.2.
