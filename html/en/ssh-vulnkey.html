SSH-VULNKEY(1)            BSD General Commands Manual           SSH-VULNKEY(1)

NAME
     ssh-vulnkey &#8212; check blacklist of compromised keys

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-vulnkey [-q | -v] file ...
     ssh-vulnkey -a

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-vulnkey checks a key against a blacklist of compromised keys.

     A substantial number of keys are known to have been generated using a bro&#8208;
     ken version of OpenSSL distributed by Debian which failed to seed its ran&#8208;
     dom number generator correctly.  Keys generated using these OpenSSL ver&#8208;
     sions should be assumed to be compromised.  This tool may be useful in
     checking for such keys.

     Keys that are compromised cannot be repaired; replacements must be gener&#8208;
     ated using ssh-keygen(1).  Make sure to update authorized_keys files on all
     systems where compromised keys were permitted to authenticate.

     The argument list will be interpreted as a list of paths to public key
     files or authorized_keys files.  If no suitable file is found at a given
     path, ssh-vulnkey will append .pub and retry, in case it was given a pri&#8208;
     vate key file.  If no files are given as arguments, ssh-vulnkey will check
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2, as well as the system&apos;s host keys if readable.

     If &#8220;-&#8221; is given as an argument, ssh-vulnkey will read from standard input.
     This can be used to process output from ssh-keyscan(1), for example:

           $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa remote.example.org | ssh-vulnkey -

     Unless the PermitBlacklistedKeys option is used, sshd(8) will reject
     attempts to authenticate with keys in the compromised list.

     The output from ssh-vulnkey looks like this:

           /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key:1: COMPROMISED: RSA1 2048 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx root@host
           /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa:1: Not blacklisted: DSA 1024 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
           /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys:3: Unknown (blacklist file not installed): RSA 1024 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx user@host

     Each line is of the following format (any lines beginning with &#8220;#&#8221; should
     be ignored by scripts):

           filename:line: status: type size fingerprint comment

     It is important to distinguish between the possible values of status:

     COMPROMISED
             These keys are listed in a blacklist file, normally because their
             corresponding private keys are well-known.  Replacements must be
             generated using ssh-keygen(1).

     Not blacklisted
             A blacklist file exists for this key type and size, but this key is
             not listed in it.  Unless there is some particular reason to
             believe otherwise, this key may be used safely.  (Note that DSA
             keys used with the broken version of OpenSSL distributed by Debian
             may be compromised in the event that anyone captured a network
             trace, even if they were generated with a secure version of
             OpenSSL.)

     Unknown (blacklist file not installed)
             No blacklist file exists for this key type and size.  You should
             find a suitable published blacklist and install it before deciding
             whether this key is safe to use.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Check keys of all users on the system.  You will typically need to
             run ssh-vulnkey as root to use this option.  For each user,
             ssh-vulnkey will check ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa,
             ~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
             ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2.  It will also check the system&apos;s host
             keys.

     -q      Quiet mode.  Normally, ssh-vulnkey outputs the fingerprint of each
             key scanned, with a description of its status.  This option sup&#8208;
             presses that output.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Normally, ssh-vulnkey does not output anything for
             keys that are not listed in their corresponding blacklist file
             (although it still produces output for keys for which there is no
             blacklist file, since their status is unknown).  This option causes
             ssh-vulnkey to produce output for all keys.

EXIT STATUS
     ssh-vulnkey will exit zero if any of the given keys were in the compromised
     list, otherwise non-zero.

BLACKLIST FILE FORMAT
     The blacklist file may start with comments, on lines starting with &#8220;#&#8221;.
     After these initial comments, it must follow a strict format:

           &#183;   All the lines must be exactly the same length (20 characters fol&#8208;
               lowed by a newline) and must be in sorted order.
           &#183;   Each line must consist of the lower-case hexadecimal MD5 key fin&#8208;
               gerprint, without colons, and with the first 12 characters
               removed (that is, the least significant 80 bits of the finger&#8208;
               print).

     The key fingerprint may be generated using ssh-keygen(1):

           $ ssh-keygen -l -f /path/to/key

     This strict format is necessary to allow the blacklist file to be checked
     quickly, using a binary-search algorithm.

FILES
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             If present, contains the protocol version 2 RSA authentication
             identity of the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_dsa
             If present, contains the protocol version 2 DSA authentication
             identity of the user.

     ~/.ssh/identity
             If present, contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication
             identity of the user.

     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
             If present, lists the public keys (RSA/DSA) that can be used for
             logging in as this user.

     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
             Obsolete name for ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.  This file may still be
             present on some old systems, but should not be created if it is
             missing.
&#12;     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
             If present, contains the protocol version 2 RSA identity of the
             system.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
             If present, contains the protocol version 2 DSA identity of the
             system.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
             If present, contains the protocol version 1 RSA identity of the
             system.

     /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.TYPE-LENGTH
             If present, lists the blacklisted keys of type TYPE (&#8220;RSA&#8221; or
             &#8220;DSA&#8221;) and bit length LENGTH.  The format of this file is described
             above.  RSA1 keys are converted to RSA before being checked in the
             blacklist.  Note that the fingerprints of RSA1 keys are computed
             differently, so you will not be able to find them in the blacklist
             by hand.

     /etc/ssh/blacklist.TYPE-LENGTH
             Same as /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.TYPE-LENGTH, but may be edited by
             the system administrator to add new blacklist entries.
