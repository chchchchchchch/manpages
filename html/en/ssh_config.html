SSH_CONFIG(5)               BSD File Formats Manual              SSH_CONFIG(5)

NAME
     ssh_config &#8212; OpenSSH SSH client configuration files

SYNOPSIS
     ~/.ssh/config
     /etc/ssh/ssh_config

DESCRIPTION
     ssh(1) obtains configuration data from the following sources in the follow&#8208;
     ing order:

           1.   command-line options
           2.   user&apos;s configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
           3.   system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)

     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The configura&#8208;
     tion files contain sections separated by &#8220;Host&#8221; specifications, and that
     section is only applied for hosts that match one of the patterns given in
     the specification.  The matched host name is the one given on the command
     line.

     Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-spe&#8208;
     cific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file, and gen&#8208;
     eral defaults at the end.

     Note that the Debian openssh-client package sets several options as stan&#8208;
     dard in /etc/ssh/ssh_config which are not the default in ssh(1):

           &#183;   SendEnv LANG LC_*
           &#183;   HashKnownHosts yes
           &#183;   GSSAPIAuthentication yes

     The configuration file has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines starting with &#8216;#&#8217; are comments.  Otherwise a line is
     of the format &#8220;keyword arguments&#8221;.  Configuration options may be separated
     by whitespace or optional whitespace and exactly one &#8216;=&#8217;; the latter format
     is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace when specifying configura&#8208;
     tion options using the ssh, scp, and sftp -o option.  Arguments may option&#8208;
     ally be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) in order to represent arguments con&#8208;
     taining spaces.

     The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that keywords
     are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):

     Host    Restricts the following declarations (up to the next Host keyword)
             to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns given
             after the keyword.  If more than one pattern is provided, they
             should be separated by whitespace.  A single &#8216;*&#8217; as a pattern can
             be used to provide global defaults for all hosts.  The host is the
             hostname argument given on the command line (i.e. the name is not
             converted to a canonicalized host name before matching).

             A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclamation
             mark (&#8216;!&#8217;).  If a negated entry is matched, then the Host entry is
             ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the line
             match.  Negated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions
             for wildcard matches.

             See PATTERNS for more information on patterns.

     AddressFamily
             Specifies which address family to use when connecting.  Valid argu&#8208;
             ments are &#8220;any&#8221;, &#8220;inet&#8221; (use IPv4 only), or &#8220;inet6&#8221; (use IPv6
             only).

     BatchMode
             If set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, passphrase/password querying will be disabled.  In
             addition, the ServerAliveInterval option will be set to 300 seconds
             by default.  This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs
             where no user is present to supply the password, and where it is
             desirable to detect a broken network swiftly.  The argument must be
             &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     BindAddress
             Use the specified address on the local machine as the source
             address of the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than
             one address.  Note that this option does not work if
             UsePrivilegedPort is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     ChallengeResponseAuthentication
             Specifies whether to use challenge-response authentication.  The
             argument to this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is
             &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     CheckHostIP
             If this flag is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, ssh(1) will additionally check the
             host IP address in the known_hosts file.  This allows ssh to detect
             if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing.  If the option is set to
             &#8220;no&#8221;, the check will not be executed.  The default is &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     Cipher  Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session in protocol
             version 1.  Currently, &#8220;blowfish&#8221;, &#8220;3des&#8221;, and &#8220;des&#8221; are supported.
             des is only supported in the ssh(1) client for interoperability
             with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support the 3des
             cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weak&#8208;
             nesses.  The default is &#8220;3des&#8221;.

     Ciphers
             Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2 in order of
             preference.  Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.  The sup&#8208;
             ported ciphers are &#8220;3des-cbc&#8221;, &#8220;aes128-cbc&#8221;, &#8220;aes192-cbc&#8221;,
             &#8220;aes256-cbc&#8221;, &#8220;aes128-ctr&#8221;, &#8220;aes192-ctr&#8221;, &#8220;aes256-ctr&#8221;,
             &#8220;arcfour128&#8221;, &#8220;arcfour256&#8221;, &#8220;arcfour&#8221;, &#8220;blowfish-cbc&#8221;, and
             &#8220;cast128-cbc&#8221;.  The default is:

                aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
                aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
                aes256-cbc,arcfour

     ClearAllForwardings
             Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings
             specified in the configuration files or on the command line be
             cleared.  This option is primarily useful when used from the ssh(1)
             command line to clear port forwardings set in configuration files,
             and is automatically set by scp(1) and sftp(1).  The argument must
             be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     Compression
             Specifies whether to use compression.  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221;
             or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     CompressionLevel
             Specifies the compression level to use if compression is enabled.
             The argument must be an integer from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best).
             The default level is 6, which is good for most applications.  The
             meaning of the values is the same as in gzip(1).  Note that this
             option applies to protocol version 1 only.

     ConnectionAttempts
             Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exit&#8208;
             ing.  The argument must be an integer.  This may be useful in
             scripts if the connection sometimes fails.  The default is 1.

     ConnectTimeout
             Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH
             server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.  This
             value is used only when the target is down or really unreachable,
             not when it refuses the connection.

     ControlMaster
             Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network con&#8208;
             nection.  When set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, ssh(1) will listen for connections on
             a control socket specified using the ControlPath argument.  Addi&#8208;
             tional sessions can connect to this socket using the same
             ControlPath with ControlMaster set to &#8220;no&#8221; (the default).  These
             sessions will try to reuse the master instance&apos;s network connection
             rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting
             normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

             Setting this to &#8220;ask&#8221; will cause ssh to listen for control connec&#8208;
             tions, but require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program
             before they are accepted (see ssh-add(1) for details).  If the
             ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh will continue without connecting
             to a master instance.

             X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported over these multiplexed
             connections, however the display and agent forwarded will be the
             one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not possible to
             forward multiple displays or agents.

             Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to
             use a master connection but fall back to creating a new one if one
             does not already exist.  These options are: &#8220;auto&#8221; and &#8220;autoask&#8221;.
             The latter requires confirmation like the &#8220;ask&#8221; option.

     ControlPath
             Specify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing
             as described in the ControlMaster section above or the string
             &#8220;none&#8221; to disable connection sharing.  In the path, &#8216;%L&#8217; will be
             substituted by the first component of the local host name, &#8216;%l&#8217;
             will be substituted by the local host name (including any domain
             name), &#8216;%h&#8217; will be substituted by the target host name, &#8216;%n&#8217; will
             be substituted by the original target host name specified on the
             command line, &#8216;%p&#8217; the port, &#8216;%r&#8217; by the remote login username, and
             &#8216;%u&#8217; by the username of the user running ssh(1).  It is recommended
             that any ControlPath used for opportunistic connection sharing
             include at least %h, %p, and %r.  This ensures that shared connec&#8208;
             tions are uniquely identified.

     ControlPersist
             When used in conjunction with ControlMaster, specifies that the
             master connection should remain open in the background (waiting for
             future client connections) after the initial client connection has
             been closed.  If set to &#8220;no&#8221;, then the master connection will not
             be placed into the background, and will close as soon as the ini&#8208;
             tial client connection is closed.  If set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, then the master
             connection will remain in the background indefinitely (until killed
             or closed via a mechanism such as the ssh(1) &#8220;-O exit&#8221; option).  If
             set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of the formats docu&#8208;
             mented in sshd_config(5), then the backgrounded master connection
             will automatically terminate after it has remained idle (with no
             client connections) for the specified time.

     DynamicForward
             Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

             The argument must be [bind_address:]port.  IPv6 addresses can be
             specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  By default,
             the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts set&#8208;
             ting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the
             connection to a specific address.  The bind_address of &#8220;localhost&#8221;
             indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only,
             while an empty address or &#8216;*&#8217; indicates that the port should be
             available from all interfaces.

             Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh(1)
             will act as a SOCKS server.  Multiple forwardings may be specified,
             and additional forwardings can be given on the command line.  Only
             the superuser can forward privileged ports.

     EnableSSHKeysign
             Setting this option to &#8220;yes&#8221; in the global client configuration
             file /etc/ssh/ssh_config enables the use of the helper program
             ssh-keysign(8) during HostbasedAuthentication.  The argument must
             be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  This option should be
             placed in the non-hostspecific section.  See ssh-keysign(8) for
             more information.

     EscapeChar
             Sets the escape character (default: &#8216;~&#8217;).  The escape character can
             also be set on the command line.  The argument should be a single
             character, &#8216;^&#8217; followed by a letter, or &#8220;none&#8221; to disable the
             escape character entirely (making the connection transparent for
             binary data).

     ExitOnForwardFailure
             Specifies whether ssh(1) should terminate the connection if it can&#8208;
             not set up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port
             forwardings.  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is
             &#8220;no&#8221;.

     ForwardAgent
             Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if
             any) will be forwarded to the remote machine.  The argument must be
             &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent&apos;s Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent through the
             forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from
             the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that
             enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into the
             agent.

     ForwardX11
             Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected
             over the secure channel and DISPLAY set.  The argument must be
             &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             user&apos;s X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to
             perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the
             ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.

     ForwardX11Timeout
             Specify a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding using the format
             described in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).  X11 con&#8208;
             nections received by ssh(1) after this time will be refused.  The
             default is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty minutes
             has elapsed.

     ForwardX11Trusted
             If this option is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, remote X11 clients will have full
             access to the original X11 display.

             If this option is set to &#8220;no&#8221;, remote X11 clients will be consid&#8208;
             ered untrusted and prevented from stealing or tampering with data
             belonging to trusted X11 clients.  Furthermore, the xauth(1) token
             used for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.
             Remote clients will be refused access after this time.

             The default is &#8220;yes&#8221; (Debian-specific).

             See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details on
             the restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.

     GatewayPorts
             Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local for&#8208;
             warded ports.  By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings to
             the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts from con&#8208;
             necting to forwarded ports.  GatewayPorts can be used to specify
             that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard
             address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.
             The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     GlobalKnownHostsFile
             Specifies one or more files to use for the global host key data&#8208;
             base, separated by whitespace.  The default is
             /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.

     GSSAPIAuthentication
             Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.
             The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Note that this option applies to protocol
             version 2 only.

     GSSAPIKeyExchange
             Specifies whether key exchange based on GSSAPI may be used. When
             using GSSAPI key exchange the server need not have a host key.  The
             default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Note that this option applies to protocol version
             2 only.

     GSSAPIClientIdentity
             If set, specifies the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should use
             when connecting to the server. The default is unset, which means
             that the default identity will be used.

     GSSAPIServerIdentity
             If set, specifies the GSSAPI server identity that ssh should expect
             when connecting to the server. The default is unset, which means
             that the expected GSSAPI server identity will be determined from
             the target hostname.

     GSSAPIDelegateCredentials
             Forward (delegate) credentials to the server.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.
             Note that this option applies to protocol version 2 connections
             using GSSAPI.

     GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey
             If set to &#8220;yes&#8221; then renewal of the client&apos;s GSSAPI credentials
             will force the rekeying of the ssh connection. With a compatible
             server, this can delegate the renewed credentials to a session on
             the server.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.
&#12;     GSSAPITrustDns
             Set to &#8220;yes to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely
             canonicalize&#8221; the name of the host being connected to. If &#8220;no, the
             hostname entered on the&#8221; command line will be passed untouched to
             the GSSAPI library.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  This option only applies
             to protocol version 2 connections using GSSAPI.

     HashKnownHosts
             Indicates that ssh(1) should hash host names and addresses when
             they are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  These hashed names may be
             used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do not reveal identi&#8208;
             fying information should the file&apos;s contents be disclosed.  The
             default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Note that existing names and addresses in known
             hosts files will not be converted automatically, but may be manu&#8208;
             ally hashed using ssh-keygen(1).  Use of this option may break
             facilities such as tab-completion that rely on being able to read
             unhashed host names from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

     HostbasedAuthentication
             Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public
             key authentication.  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The
             default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  This option applies to protocol version 2 only
             and is similar to RhostsRSAAuthentication.

     HostKeyAlgorithms
             Specifies the protocol version 2 host key algorithms that the
             client wants to use in order of preference.  The default for this
             option is:

                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v00@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                ssh-rsa,ssh-dss

             If hostkeys are known for the destination host then this default is
             modified to prefer their algorithms.

     HostKeyAlias
             Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host
             name when looking up or saving the host key in the host key data&#8208;
             base files.  This option is useful for tunneling SSH connections or
             for multiple servers running on a single host.

     HostName
             Specifies the real host name to log into.  This can be used to
             specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts.  If the hostname con&#8208;
             tains the character sequence &#8216;%h&#8217;, then this will be replaced with
             the host name specified on the command line (this is useful for
             manipulating unqualified names).  The default is the name given on
             the command line.  Numeric IP addresses are also permitted (both on
             the command line and in HostName specifications).

     IdentitiesOnly
             Specifies that ssh(1) should only use the authentication identity
             files configured in the ssh_config files, even if ssh-agent(1)
             offers more identities.  The argument to this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221;
             or &#8220;no&#8221;.  This option is intended for situations where ssh-agent
             offers many different identities.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     IdentityFile
             Specifies a file from which the user&apos;s DSA, ECDSA or DSA authenti&#8208;
             cation identity is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for proto&#8208;
             col version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             for protocol version 2.  Additionally, any identities represented
             by the authentication agent will be used for authentication.
             ssh(1) will try to load certificate information from the filename
             obtained by appending -cert.pub to the path of a specified
             IdentityFile.

             The file name may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user&apos;s home
             directory or one of the following escape characters: &#8216;%d&#8217; (local
             user&apos;s home directory), &#8216;%u&#8217; (local user name), &#8216;%l&#8217; (local host
             name), &#8216;%h&#8217; (remote host name) or &#8216;%r&#8217; (remote user name).

             It is possible to have multiple identity files specified in config&#8208;
             uration files; all these identities will be tried in sequence.
             Multiple IdentityFile directives will add to the list of identities
             tried (this behaviour differs from that of other configuration
             directives).

     IPQoS   Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for connections.
             Accepted values are &#8220;af11&#8221;, &#8220;af12&#8221;, &#8220;af13&#8221;, &#8220;af21&#8221;, &#8220;af22&#8221;, &#8220;af23&#8221;,
             &#8220;af31&#8221;, &#8220;af32&#8221;, &#8220;af33&#8221;, &#8220;af41&#8221;, &#8220;af42&#8221;, &#8220;af43&#8221;, &#8220;cs0&#8221;, &#8220;cs1&#8221;,
             &#8220;cs2&#8221;, &#8220;cs3&#8221;, &#8220;cs4&#8221;, &#8220;cs5&#8221;, &#8220;cs6&#8221;, &#8220;cs7&#8221;, &#8220;ef&#8221;, &#8220;lowdelay&#8221;,
             &#8220;throughput&#8221;, &#8220;reliability&#8221;, or a numeric value.  This option may
             take one or two arguments, separated by whitespace.  If one argu&#8208;
             ment is specified, it is used as the packet class unconditionally.
             If two values are specified, the first is automatically selected
             for interactive sessions and the second for non-interactive ses&#8208;
             sions.  The default is &#8220;lowdelay&#8221; for interactive sessions and
             &#8220;throughput&#8221; for non-interactive sessions.

     KbdInteractiveAuthentication
             Specifies whether to use keyboard-interactive authentication.  The
             argument to this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is
             &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     KbdInteractiveDevices
             Specifies the list of methods to use in keyboard-interactive
             authentication.  Multiple method names must be comma-separated.
             The default is to use the server specified list.  The methods
             available vary depending on what the server supports.  For an
             OpenSSH server, it may be zero or more of: &#8220;bsdauth&#8221;, &#8220;pam&#8221;, and
             &#8220;skey&#8221;.

     KexAlgorithms
             Specifies the available KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms.  Multiple
             algorithms must be comma-separated.  The default is:

                   ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,
                   diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,
                   diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

     LocalCommand
             Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after success&#8208;
             fully connecting to the server.  The command string extends to the
             end of the line, and is executed with the user&apos;s shell.  The fol&#8208;
             lowing escape character substitutions will be performed: &#8216;%d&#8217;
             (local user&apos;s home directory), &#8216;%h&#8217; (remote host name), &#8216;%l&#8217; (local
             host name), &#8216;%n&#8217; (host name as provided on the command line), &#8216;%p&#8217;
             (remote port), &#8216;%r&#8217; (remote user name) or &#8216;%u&#8217; (local user name).

             The command is run synchronously and does not have access to the
             session of the ssh(1) that spawned it.  It should not be used for
             interactive commands.

             This directive is ignored unless PermitLocalCommand has been
             enabled.

     LocalForward
             Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over
             the secure channel to the specified host and port from the remote
             machine.  The first argument must be [bind_address:]port and the
             second argument must be host:hostport.  IPv6 addresses can be spec&#8208;
             ified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forward&#8208;
             ings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on
             the command line.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
             By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
             GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be
             used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of &#8220;localhost&#8221; indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or &#8216;*&#8217; indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     LogLevel
             Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from
             ssh(1).  The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VER&#8208;
             BOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.
             DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify
             higher levels of verbose output.

     MACs    Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms in order
             of preference.  The MAC algorithm is used in protocol version 2 for
             data integrity protection.  Multiple algorithms must be comma-sepa&#8208;
             rated.  The default is:

                   hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,
                   hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96,
                   hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-256-96,hmac-sha2-512,
                   hmac-sha2-512-96

     NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost
             This option can be used if the home directory is shared across
             machines.  In this case localhost will refer to a different machine
             on each of the machines and the user will get many warnings about
             changed host keys.  However, this option disables host authentica&#8208;
             tion for localhost.  The argument to this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or
             &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is to check the host key for localhost.

     NumberOfPasswordPrompts
             Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up.  The
             argument to this keyword must be an integer.  The default is 3.

     PasswordAuthentication
             Specifies whether to use password authentication.  The argument to
             this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;yes&#8221;.

     PermitLocalCommand
             Allow local command execution via the LocalCommand option or using
             the !command escape sequence in ssh(1).  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221;
             or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     PKCS11Provider
             Specifies which PKCS#11 provider to use.  The argument to this key&#8208;
             word is the PKCS#11 shared library ssh(1) should use to communicate
             with a PKCS#11 token providing the user&apos;s private RSA key.

     Port    Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.  The
             default is 22.

     PreferredAuthentications
             Specifies the order in which the client should try protocol 2
             authentication methods.  This allows a client to prefer one method
             (e.g. keyboard-interactive) over another method (e.g. password).
             The default is:

                   gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,publickey,
                   keyboard-interactive,password

     Protocol
             Specifies the protocol versions ssh(1) should support in order of
             preference.  The possible values are &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;2&#8217;.  Multiple ver&#8208;
             sions must be comma-separated.  When this option is set to &#8220;2,1&#8221;
             ssh will try version 2 and fall back to version 1 if version 2 is
             not available.  The default is &#8216;2&#8217;.

     ProxyCommand
             Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.  The command
             string extends to the end of the line, and is executed with the
             user&apos;s shell.  In the command string, any occurrence of &#8216;%h&#8217; will
             be substituted by the host name to connect, &#8216;%p&#8217; by the port, and
             &#8216;%r&#8217; by the remote user name.  The command can be basically any&#8208;
             thing, and should read from its standard input and write to its
             standard output.  It should eventually connect an sshd(8) server
             running on some machine, or execute sshd -i somewhere.  Host key
             management will be done using the HostName of the host being con&#8208;
             nected (defaulting to the name typed by the user).  Setting the
             command to &#8220;none&#8221; disables this option entirely.  Note that
             CheckHostIP is not available for connects with a proxy command.

             This directive is useful in conjunction with nc(1) and its proxy
             support.  For example, the following directive would connect via an
             HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

                ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p

     PubkeyAuthentication
             Specifies whether to try public key authentication.  The argument
             to this keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;yes&#8221;.  This
             option applies to protocol version 2 only.

     RekeyLimit
             Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before
             the session key is renegotiated.  The argument is the number of
             bytes, with an optional suffix of &#8216;K&#8217;, &#8216;M&#8217;, or &#8216;G&#8217; to indicate
             Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is
             between &#8216;1G&#8217; and &#8216;4G&#8217;, depending on the cipher.  This option
             applies to protocol version 2 only.

     RemoteForward
             Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over
             the secure channel to the specified host and port from the local
             machine.  The first argument must be [bind_address:]port and the
             second argument must be host:hostport.  IPv6 addresses can be spec&#8208;
             ified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forward&#8208;
             ings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on
             the command line.  Privileged ports can be forwarded only when log&#8208;
             ging in as root on the remote machine.

             If the port argument is &#8216;0&#8217;, the listen port will be dynamically
             allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.

             If the bind_address is not specified, the default is to only bind
             to loopback addresses.  If the bind_address is &#8216;*&#8217; or an empty
             string, then the forwarding is requested to listen on all inter&#8208;
             faces.  Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the
             server&apos;s GatewayPorts option is enabled (see sshd_config(5)).

     RequestTTY
             Specifies whether to request a pseudo-tty for the session.  The
             argument may be one of: &#8220;no&#8221; (never request a TTY), &#8220;yes&#8221; (always
             request a TTY when standard input is a TTY), &#8220;force&#8221; (always
             request a TTY) or &#8220;auto&#8221; (request a TTY when opening a login ses&#8208;
             sion).  This option mirrors the -t and -T flags for ssh(1).

     RhostsRSAAuthentication
             Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with RSA host
             authentication.  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default
             is &#8220;no&#8221;.  This option applies to protocol version 1 only and
             requires ssh(1) to be setuid root.

     RSAAuthentication
             Specifies whether to try RSA authentication.  The argument to this
             keyword must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  RSA authentication will only be
             attempted if the identity file exists, or an authentication agent
             is running.  The default is &#8220;yes&#8221;.  Note that this option applies
             to protocol version 1 only.

     SendEnv
             Specifies what variables from the local environ(7) should be sent
             to the server.  Note that environment passing is only supported for
             protocol 2.  The server must also support it, and the server must
             be configured to accept these environment variables.  Refer to
             AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how to configure the server.  Vari&#8208;
             ables are specified by name, which may contain wildcard characters.
             Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or
             spread across multiple SendEnv directives.  The default is not to
             send any environment variables.

             See PATTERNS for more information on patterns.

     ServerAliveCountMax
             Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be
             sent without ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the server.
             If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being
             sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.
             It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is
             very different from TCPKeepAlive (below).  The server alive mes&#8208;
             sages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not
             be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is
             spoofable.  The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client
             or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.

             The default value is 3.  If, for example, ServerAliveInterval (see
             below) is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default,
             if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will disconnect after
             approximately 45 seconds.  This option applies to protocol version
             2 only; in protocol version 1 there is no mechanism to request a
             response from the server to the server alive messages, so discon&#8208;
             nection is the responsibility of the TCP stack.

     ServerAliveInterval
             Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been
             received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through the
             encrypted channel to request a response from the server.  The
             default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to
             the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set.  This option
             applies to protocol version 2 only.  ProtocolKeepAlives and
             SetupTimeOut are Debian-specific compatibility aliases for this
             option.

     StrictHostKeyChecking
             If this flag is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, ssh(1) will never automatically add
             host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to
             hosts whose host key has changed.  This provides maximum protection
             against trojan horse attacks, though it can be annoying when the
             /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is poorly maintained or when connec&#8208;
             tions to new hosts are frequently made.  This option forces the
             user to manually add all new hosts.  If this flag is set to &#8220;no&#8221;,
             ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts
             files.  If this flag is set to &#8220;ask&#8221;, new host keys will be added
             to the user known host files only after the user has confirmed that
             is what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to
             hosts whose host key has changed.  The host keys of known hosts
             will be verified automatically in all cases.  The argument must be
             &#8220;yes&#8221;, &#8220;no&#8221;, or &#8220;ask&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;ask&#8221;.

     TCPKeepAlive
             Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to
             the other side.  If they are sent, death of the connection or crash
             of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  This option only
             uses TCP keepalives (as opposed to using ssh level keepalives), so
             takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.  As such, you
             probably want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.  However,
             this means that connections will die if the route is down temporar&#8208;
             ily, and some people find it annoying.

             The default is &#8220;yes&#8221; (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the
             client will notice if the network goes down or the remote host
             dies.  This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.

             To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to &#8220;no&#8221;.

     Tunnel  Request tun(4) device forwarding between the client and the server.
             The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221;, &#8220;point-to-point&#8221; (layer 3), &#8220;ethernet&#8221;
             (layer 2), or &#8220;no&#8221;.  Specifying &#8220;yes&#8221; requests the default tunnel
             mode, which is &#8220;point-to-point&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     TunnelDevice
             Specifies the tun(4) devices to open on the client (local_tun) and
             the server (remote_tun).

             The argument must be local_tun[:remote_tun].  The devices may be
             specified by numerical ID or the keyword &#8220;any&#8221;, which uses the next
             available tunnel device.  If remote_tun is not specified, it
             defaults to &#8220;any&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;any:any&#8221;.

     UseBlacklistedKeys
             Specifies whether ssh(1) should use keys recorded in its blacklist
             of known-compromised keys (see ssh-vulnkey(1)) for authentication.
             If &#8220;yes&#8221;, then attempts to use compromised keys for authentication
             will be logged but accepted.  It is strongly recommended that this
             be used only to install new authorized keys on the remote system,
             and even then only with the utmost care.  If &#8220;no&#8221;, then attempts to
             use compromised keys for authentication will be prevented.  The
             default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     UsePrivilegedPort
             Specifies whether to use a privileged port for outgoing connec&#8208;
             tions.  The argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.
             If set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, ssh(1) must be setuid root.  Note that this option
             must be set to &#8220;yes&#8221; for RhostsRSAAuthentication with older
             servers.

     User    Specifies the user to log in as.  This can be useful when a differ&#8208;
             ent user name is used on different machines.  This saves the trou&#8208;
             ble of having to remember to give the user name on the command
             line.

     UserKnownHostsFile
             Specifies one or more files to use for the user host key database,
             separated by whitespace.  The default is ~/.ssh/known_hosts,
             ~/.ssh/known_hosts2.

     VerifyHostKeyDNS
             Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP
             resource records.  If this option is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, the client will
             implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint from DNS.
             Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to
             &#8220;ask&#8221;.  If this option is set to &#8220;ask&#8221;, information on fingerprint
             match will be displayed, but the user will still need to confirm
             new host keys according to the StrictHostKeyChecking option.  The
             argument must be &#8220;yes&#8221;, &#8220;no&#8221;, or &#8220;ask&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Note
             that this option applies to protocol version 2 only.

             See also VERIFYING HOST KEYS in ssh(1).

     VisualHostKey
             If this flag is set to &#8220;yes&#8221;, an ASCII art representation of the
             remote host key fingerprint is printed in addition to the hex fin&#8208;
             gerprint string at login and for unknown host keys.  If this flag
             is set to &#8220;no&#8221;, no fingerprint strings are printed at login and
             only the hex fingerprint string will be printed for unknown host
             keys.  The default is &#8220;no&#8221;.

     XAuthLocation
             Specifies the full pathname of the xauth(1) program.  The default
             is /usr/bin/xauth.

PATTERNS
     A pattern consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters, &#8216;*&#8217; (a wild&#8208;
     card that matches zero or more characters), or &#8216;?&#8217; (a wildcard that matches
     exactly one character).  For example, to specify a set of declarations for
     any host in the &#8220;.co.uk&#8221; set of domains, the following pattern could be
     used:

           Host *.co.uk

     The following pattern would match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9] network
     range:

           Host 192.168.0.?

     A pattern-list is a comma-separated list of patterns.  Patterns within pat&#8208;
     tern-lists may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark (&#8216;!&#8217;).
     For example, to allow a key to be used from anywhere within an organisation
     except from the &#8220;dialup&#8221; pool, the following entry (in authorized_keys)
     could be used:

           from=&quot;!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com&quot;

FILES
     ~/.ssh/config
             This is the per-user configuration file.  The format of this file
             is described above.  This file is used by the SSH client.  Because
             of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict permissions:
             read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.  It may be
             group-writable provided that the group in question contains only
             the user.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_config
             Systemwide configuration file.  This file provides defaults for
             those values that are not specified in the user&apos;s configuration
             file, and for those users who do not have a configuration file.
             This file must be world-readable.
