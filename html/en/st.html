ST(1)                                                                      ST(1)



NAME
       st - simple terminal

SYNOPSIS
       st [-c class] [-t title] [-v] [-e cmd]

DESCRIPTION
       st is a simple terminal emulator.

OPTIONS
       -t title
              Overrides the default title (st)

       -c class
              Overrides the default class ($TERM)

       -v     Prints version information to standard output, then exits.

       -e cmd [arguments]
              Execute  cmd  instead of the shell. Type your command as you would
              on your shell. If this option is used, it must be the last on  the
              command-line. This is the same behaviour as xterm/rxvt.
