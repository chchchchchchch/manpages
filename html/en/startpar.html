STARTPAR(8)                                                          STARTPAR(8)



NAME
       startpar - start runlevel scripts in parallel


SYNOPSIS
       startpar  [-p  par] [-i iorate] [-t timeout] [-T global_timeout] [-a arg]
       prg1 prg2 ...
       startpar [-p par] [-i iorate]  [-t  timeout]  [-T  global_timeout]  -M  [
       boot|start|stop]


DESCRIPTION
       startpar  is  used  to  run  multiple run-level scripts in parallel.  The
       degree of parallelism on one CPU can be  set  with  the  -p  option,  the
       default  is  full  parallelism.  An argument to all of the scripts can be
       provided with the -a option.  Processes blocked by pending I/O will cause
       new  process creation to be weighted by the iorate factor 800.  To change
       this factor the option -i can be used  to  specify  another  value.   The
       amount  weight  =  (nblocked times iorate) / 1000 will be subtracted from
       the total number of processes which could be started, where  nblocked  is
       the number of processes currently blocked by pending I/O.

       The  output of each script is buffered and written when the script exits,
       so output lines of different scripts won&apos;t mix. You can modify  this  be&#8208;
       haviour by setting a timeout.

       The timeout set with the -t option is used as buffer timeout. If the out&#8208;
       put buffer of a script is not empty and the last output was timeout  sec&#8208;
       onds ago, startpar will flush the buffer.

       The  -T  option  timeout works more globally. If no output is printed for
       more than global_timeout seconds, startpar will flush the buffer  of  the
       script  with  the  oldest output. Afterwards it will only print output of
       this script until it is finished.

       The -M option switches startpar into  a  make(1)  like  behaviour.   This
       option takes three different arguments: boot, start, and stop for reading
       .depend.boot or .depend.start or .depend.stop respectively in the  direc&#8208;
       tory  /etc/init.d/.   By  scanning  the  boot and runlevel directories in
       /etc/init.d/ it then executes the appropriate scripts in parallel.
