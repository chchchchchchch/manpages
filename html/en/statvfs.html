STATVFS(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STATVFS(3)



NAME
       statvfs, fstatvfs - get file system statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;

       int statvfs(const char *path, struct statvfs *buf);
       int fstatvfs(int fd, struct statvfs *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  statvfs() returns information about a mounted file system.
       path is the pathname of any file within the mounted file system.  buf  is
       a pointer to a statvfs structure defined approximately as follows:

           struct statvfs {
               unsigned long  f_bsize;    /* file system block size */
               unsigned long  f_frsize;   /* fragment size */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_blocks;   /* size of fs in f_frsize units */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_bfree;    /* # free blocks */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_bavail;   /* # free blocks for unprivileged users */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_files;    /* # inodes */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_ffree;    /* # free inodes */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_favail;   /* # free inodes for unprivileged users */
               unsigned long  f_fsid;     /* file system ID */
               unsigned long  f_flag;     /* mount flags */
               unsigned long  f_namemax;  /* maximum filename length */
           };

       Here  the  types  fsblkcnt_t and fsfilcnt_t are defined in &lt;sys/types.h&gt;.
       Both used to be unsigned long.

       The field f_flag is a bit mask (of  mount  flags,  see  mount(8)).   Bits
       defined by POSIX are

       ST_RDONLY
              Read-only file system.

       ST_NOSUID
              Set-user-ID/set-group-ID bits are ignored by exec(3).

       It  is  unspecified whether all members of the returned struct have mean&#8208;
       ingful values on all file systems.

       fstatvfs() returns the same information about an open file referenced  by
       descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES (statvfs()) Search permission is denied for  a  component  of  the
              path prefix of path.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EBADF  (fstatvfs()) fd is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EFAULT Buf or path points to an invalid address.

       EINTR  This call was interrupted by a signal.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.
&#12;       ELOOP  (statvfs())  Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat&#8208;
              ing path.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              (statvfs()) path is too long.

       ENOENT (statvfs()) The file referred to by path does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSYS The file system does not support this call.

       ENOTDIR
              (statvfs()) A component of the path prefix of path is not a direc&#8208;
              tory.

       EOVERFLOW
              Some  values  were  too  large  to  be represented in the returned
              struct.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The Linux kernel has system calls statfs(2)  and  fstatfs(2)  to  support
       this library call.

       The current glibc implementations of

          pathconf(path, _PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN);
          pathconf(path, _PC_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN);
          pathconf(path, _PC_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE);

       respectively use the f_frsize, f_frsize, and f_bsize fields of the return
       value of statvfs(path,buf).
