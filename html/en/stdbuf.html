NAME
       stdbuf - Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard
       streams.

SYNOPSIS
       stdbuf OPTION... COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -i, --input=MODE
              adjust standard input stream buffering

       -o, --output=MODE
              adjust standard output stream buffering

       -e, --error=MODE
              adjust standard error stream buffering

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If MODE is `L&apos; the corresponding stream  will  be  line  buffered.   This
       option is invalid with standard input.

       If MODE is `0&apos; the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.

       Otherwise MODE is a number which may be followed by one of the following:
       KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E,  Z,
       Y.  In this case the corresponding stream will be fully buffered with the
       buffer size set to MODE bytes.

       NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of  its  standard  streams  (`tee&apos;
       does  for e.g.) then that will override corresponding settings changed by
       `stdbuf&apos;.  Also some filters (like `dd&apos; and `cat&apos; etc.) don&apos;t use streams
       for I/O, and are thus unaffected by `stdbuf&apos; settings.

EXAMPLES
       tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d &apos; &apos; -f1 | uniq
       This will immedidately display unique entries from access.log

BUGS
       On  GLIBC  platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e. using fully buffered
       mode will result in undefined operation.
