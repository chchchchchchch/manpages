STDIN(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   STDIN(3)



NAME
       stdin, stdout, stderr - standard I/O streams

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       extern FILE *stdin;
       extern FILE *stdout;
       extern FILE *stderr;

DESCRIPTION
       Under  normal  circumstances  every UNIX program has three streams opened
       for it when it starts up, one for input, one  for  output,  and  one  for
       printing  diagnostic  or error messages.  These are typically attached to
       the user&apos;s terminal (see tty(4) but might instead refer to files or other
       devices, depending on what the parent process chose to set up.  (See also
       the &quot;Redirection&quot; section of sh(1).)

       The input stream is referred to as &quot;standard input&quot;; the output stream is
       referred  to as &quot;standard output&quot;; and the error stream is referred to as
       &quot;standard error&quot;.  These terms are abbreviated to form the  symbols  used
       to refer to these files, namely stdin, stdout, and stderr.

       Each  of  these  symbols is a stdio(3) macro of type pointer to FILE, and
       can be used with functions like fprintf(3) or fread(3).

       Since FILEs are a buffering wrapper around  UNIX  file  descriptors,  the
       same underlying files may also be accessed using the raw UNIX file inter&#8208;
       face, that is, the functions like read(2) and lseek(2).

       On program startup, the integer  file  descriptors  associated  with  the
       streams  stdin,  stdout,  and  stderr are 0, 1, and 2, respectively.  The
       preprocessor symbols STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and  STDERR_FILENO  are
       defined  with these values in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.  (Applying freopen(3) to one of
       these streams can change the file descriptor number associated  with  the
       stream.)

       Note  that mixing use of FILEs and raw file descriptors can produce unex&#8208;
       pected results and should generally be  avoided.   (For  the  masochistic
       among  you: POSIX.1, section 8.2.3, describes in detail how this interac&#8208;
       tion is supposed to work.)  A general rule is that file  descriptors  are
       handled  in  the  kernel,  while stdio is just a library.  This means for
       example, that after an exec(3), the child inherits all open file descrip&#8208;
       tors, but all old streams have become inaccessible.

       Since  the  symbols stdin, stdout, and stderr are specified to be macros,
       assigning to them is nonportable.  The standard streams can  be  made  to
       refer  to  different  files with help of the library function freopen(3),
       specially introduced to make it possible to reassign stdin,  stdout,  and
       stderr.  The standard streams are closed by a call to exit(3) and by nor&#8208;
       mal program termination.

CONFORMING TO
       The stdin, stdout, and stderr macros conform to  C89  and  this  standard
       also  stipulates  that  these  three  streams  shall  be  open at program
       startup.

NOTES
       The stream stderr is unbuffered.  The stream stdout is line-buffered when
       it  points  to a terminal.  Partial lines will not appear until fflush(3)
       or exit(3) is called, or a newline is printed.  This  can  produce  unex&#8208;
       pected  results, especially with debugging output.  The buffering mode of
       the standard streams (or any other stream) can be changed using the  set&#8208;
       buf(3)  or setvbuf(3) call.  Note that in case stdin is associated with a
       terminal, there may also be  input  buffering  in  the  terminal  driver,
       entirely  unrelated to stdio buffering.  (Indeed, normally terminal input
       is line buffered in the kernel.)  This kernel input handling can be modi&#8208;
       fied using calls like tcsetattr(3); see also stty(1), and termios(3).
