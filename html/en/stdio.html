STDIO(3)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   STDIO(3)



NAME
       stdio - standard input/output library functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *stdin;
       FILE *stdout;
       FILE *stderr;

DESCRIPTION
       The  standard I/O library provides a simple and efficient buffered stream
       I/O interface.  Input and output is mapped into logical data streams  and
       the physical I/O characteristics are concealed.  The functions and macros
       are listed below; more information is available from the  individual  man
       pages.

       A  stream  is  associated  with an external file (which may be a physical
       device) by opening a file, which may involve creating a new file.  Creat&#8208;
       ing  an  existing  file causes its former contents to be discarded.  If a
       file can support positioning requests (such as a disk file, as opposed to
       a  terminal) then a file position indicator associated with the stream is
       positioned at the start of the file  (byte  zero),  unless  the  file  is
       opened  with  append  mode.   If  append  mode is used, it is unspecified
       whether the position indicator will be placed at the start or the end  of
       the  file.   The  position  indicator  is maintained by subsequent reads,
       writes and positioning requests.  All input occurs as if  the  characters
       were  read by successive calls to the fgetc(3) function; all output takes
       place as if all characters  were  written  by  successive  calls  to  the
       fputc(3) function.

       A  file  is  disassociated  from  a  stream  by closing the file.  Output
       streams are flushed (any unwritten buffer contents are transferred to the
       host  environment) before the stream is disassociated from the file.  The
       value of a pointer to a FILE object is  indeterminate  after  a  file  is
       closed (garbage).

       A  file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or another program exe&#8208;
       cution, and its contents reclaimed or modified (if it can be repositioned
       at  the  start).  If the main function returns to its original caller, or
       the exit(3) function is called, all open files are closed (hence all out&#8208;
       put  streams  are  flushed) before program termination.  Other methods of
       program termination, such as abort(3) do not bother about  closing  files
       properly.

       At  program  startup,  three  text streams are predefined and need not be
       opened explicitly: standard input (for reading conventional input), stan&#8208;
       dard  output  (for  writing  conventional input), and standard error (for
       writing diagnostic output).  These streams are  abbreviated  stdin,stdout
       and  stderr.   When  opened,  the  standard  error  stream  is  not fully
       buffered; the standard input and output streams are fully buffered if and
       only if the streams do not to refer to an interactive device.

       Output streams that refer to terminal devices are always line buffered by
       default; pending output to such streams is written automatically whenever
       an input stream that refers to a terminal device is read.  In cases where
       a large amount of computation is done after printing part of a line on an
       output  terminal, it is necessary to fflush(3) the standard output before
       going off and computing so that the output will appear.

       The stdio library is a part of the library libc and routines are automat&#8208;
       ically  loaded  as needed by the compilers cc(1) and pc(1).  The SYNOPSIS
       sections of the following manual pages indicate which include  files  are
       to be used, what the compiler declaration for the function looks like and
       which external variables are of interest.

       The following are defined as macros; these names may not be reused  with&#8208;
       out  first  removing  their current definitions with #undef: BUFSIZ, EOF,
       FILENAME_MAX, FOPEN_MAX, L_cuserid, L_ctermid, L_tmpnam, NULL,  SEEK_END,
       SEEK_SET,  SEEK_CUR,  TMP_MAX,  clearerr,  feof,  ferror,  fileno,  getc,
       getchar, putc, putchar, stderr, stdin, stdout.  Function versions of  the
       macro  functions feof, ferror, clearerr, fileno, getc, getchar, putc, and
       putchar exist and will be used if the macros definitions  are  explicitly
       removed.
