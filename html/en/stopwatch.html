STOPWATCH(1x)                                                      STOPWATCH(1x)



NAME
       stopwatch &#8212; a stopwatch and timer program

SYNOPSIS
       stopwatch

DESCRIPTION
       stopwatch  does  what  its name implies - enables hand timing much like a
       physical stopwatch. It can also be used as a countdown  timer.  Stopwatch
       has millisecond accuracy and no artificial limit on hours.

DIRECTIONS
       Press  &quot;start&quot;  to  start  the  stopwatch and &quot;stop&quot; to stop it. &quot;record&quot;
       records the current time and selects it so that it can readily be  pasted
       into  other  programs. Recorded times are marked with an L for &quot;lap&quot; or T
       for &quot;total&quot;. When stopped, you can cut/paste/edit the time  by  hand  and
       set  it  to  any valid time. &quot;zero&quot; resets the time to zero. Holding down
       the shift key while pressing record or zero, records and then  zeros  the
       time.

       Time  moves  forward  or  backward according to the Run menu. By default,
       time is stopped automatically when either the lap or total  time  reaches
       zero. To disable the automatic stop, unselect Run -&gt; Stop At Zero.
