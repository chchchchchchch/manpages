STPNCPY(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STPNCPY(3)



NAME
       stpncpy - copy a fixed-size string, returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       char *stpncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       stpncpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  stpncpy()  function  copies  at  most  n  characters from the string
       pointed to by src, including the terminating null  byte  (&apos;\0&apos;),  to  the
       array  pointed to by dest.  Exactly n characters are written at dest.  If
       the length strlen(src) is smaller than n, the remaining characters in the
       array pointed to by dest are filled with null bytes (&apos;\0&apos;), If the length
       strlen(src) is greater or equal to n, the string pointed to by dest  will
       not be null-terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The  programmer  must ensure that there is room for at least n characters
       at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       stpncpy() returns a pointer to the terminating null byte in dest, or,  if
       dest is not null-terminated, dest + n.

CONFORMING TO
       This function was added to POSIX.1-2008. Before that, it was a GNU exten&#8208;
       sion.
