STRCOLL(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STRCOLL(3)



NAME
       strcoll - compare two strings using the current locale

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       int strcoll(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The strcoll() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It returns an
       integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found, respec&#8208;
       tively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.  The comparison
       is based on strings interpreted as appropriate for the program&apos;s  current
       locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See setlocale(3).)

RETURN VALUE
       The strcoll() function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater
       than zero if s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or  be
       greater than s2, when both are interpreted as appropriate for the current
       locale.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.

NOTES
       In the &quot;POSIX&quot; or &quot;C&quot; locales strcoll() is equivalent to strcmp(3).
