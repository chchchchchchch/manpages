NAME
       strspn, strcspn - search a string for a set of bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       size_t strspn(const char *s, const char *accept);

       size_t strcspn(const char *s, const char *reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strspn()  function  calculates  the length (in bytes) of the initial
       segment of s which consists entirely of bytes in accept.

       The strcspn() function calculates the length of the initial segment of  s
       which consists entirely of bytes not in reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strspn() function returns the number of bytes in the initial segment
       of s which consist only of bytes from accept.

       The strcspn() function returns the number of bytes in the initial segment
       of s which are not in the string reject.
