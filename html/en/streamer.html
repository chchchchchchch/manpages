streamer(1)                                                          streamer(1)



NAME
       streamer - record audio and/or video

SYNOPSIS
       streamer [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       streamer  reads audio and/or video data from /dev/video0 and /dev/dsp and
       writes the data to the  disk.   Various  output  formats  are  supported.
       Start  streamer with &apos;-h&apos; for a list of options and supported output for&#8208;
       mats.

       streamer will use the file extention of the output file  name  to  figure
       which  format  to  use.  You need the -f/-F options only if the extention
       allows more than one format.  If you get the  &quot;neither  audio  nor  video
       format  specified/found&quot;  message  and don&apos;t know why, you can enable the
       debug output (-d switch) to see what is going on.

       You can safely stop the recording at any time with Ctrl+C.  streamer will
       catch  the  signal  and  stop  recording correctly (i.e. write movie file
       headers) before exiting.

EXAMPLES
       streamer -o foobar.jpeg
              write a single jpeg file.

       streamer -o quicktime.mov -f yuv2 -F stereo -r 12 -t 0:10
              record a short quicktime movie.
