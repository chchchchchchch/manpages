STRFILE(1)                UNIX System Manager&apos;s Manual                STRFILE(1)



NAME
       strfile - create a random access file for storing strings
       unstr - dump strings in pointer order

SYNOPSIS
       strfile [-iorsx] [-c char] sourcefile [outputfile]
       unstr [-c char] datafile[.ext] [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       strfile  reads a file containing groups of lines separated by a line con&#8208;
       taining a single percent `%&apos; sign (or other specified  delimiter  charac&#8208;
       ter)  and creates a data file which contains a header structure and a ta&#8208;
       ble of file offsets for each group of lines. This allows random access of
       the strings.

       The  output  file, if not specified on the command line, is named source&#8208;
       file.dat.

       The purpose of unstr is to undo the work of strfile.  It prints  out  the
       strings  contained  in  the sourcefile, which is datafile.ext without its
       extension, or datafile if no extension is specified (in  this  case,  the
       extension  .dat  is  added to the name of the datafile) in the order that
       they are listed in the header file datafile.  If no outputfile is  speci&#8208;
       fied, it prints to standard output; otherwise it prints to the file spec&#8208;
       ified.  unstr can also universally change the delimiter  character  in  a
       strings file.  It is possible to create sorted versions of input files by
       using strfile -o and then using unstr to  dump  them  out  in  the  table
       order.

   Options
       The options are as follows:

       -c char
              Change  the  delimiting  character  from the percent sign to char.
              This option is available for both strfile and unstr.

       -i     Ignore case when ordering the strings.

       -o     Order the strings in alphabetical order.  The offset table will be
              sorted  in  the  alphabetical  order of the groups of lines refer&#8208;
              enced.  Any initial non-alphanumeric characters are ignored.  This
              option causes the STR_ORDERED bit in the header str_flags field to
              be set. (It also now really does sort! It didn&apos;t used to).

       -r     Randomize access to the strings.  Entries in the offset table will
              be randomly ordered.  This option causes the STR_RANDOM bit in the
              header str_flags field to be set. (And really does randomize)

       -s     Run silently; don&apos;t give a summary message when finished.

       -x     Note that each alphabetic character in  the  groups  of  lines  is
              rotated  13  positions  in  a  simple  caesar cypher.  This option
              causes the STR_ROTATED bit in the header  str_flags  field  to  be
              set. Note that it does not rotate the strings--that operation must
              be performed separately.

   Header
       The format of the header is:

       #define VERSION 1
       unsigned long str_version;  /* version number */
       unsigned long str_numstr;   /* # of strings in the file */
       unsigned long str_longlen;  /* length of longest string */
       unsigned long str_shortlen; /* shortest string length */
       #define STR_RANDOM    0x1   /* randomized pointers */
       #define STR_ORDERED   0x2   /* ordered pointers */
       #define STR_ROTATED   0x4   /* rot-13&apos;d text */
       unsigned long str_flags;    /* bit field for flags */
       char str_delim;             /* delimiting character */

       All fields are written in network byte order.

BUGS
       Fewer now, one hopes.  However, fortunes (text strings) beginning with  a
       blank  line  appear  to  be sorted between random letters.  This includes
       ASCII art that contains no letters, and first lines that are solely  non-
       alphanumeric, apparently.  I&apos;ve no idea why this should be.

OTHER USES
       What can you do with this besides printing sarcastic and obscene messages
       to the screens of lusers at login or logout?

       There are some other possibilities.  Source code for  a  sample  program,
       randstr,  is  included with this distribution: randstr splits the differ&#8208;
       ence between unstr and fortune.  It reads a single, specified  file,  and
       randomly selects a single text string.

       1      Include strfile.h into a news reading/posting program, to generate
              random signatures.  Tin(1) does something similar, in a much  more
              complex manner.

       2      Include  it  in a game.  While strfile doesn&apos;t support &apos;fields&apos; or
              &apos;records&apos;, there&apos;s no reason that the text strings can&apos;t  be  con&#8208;
              sistent:  first  line, a die roll; second line, a score; third and
              subsequent lines, a text message.

       3      Use it to store your address book.  Hell, some of the guys I  know
              would  be  as  well  off  using it to decide who to call on Friday
              nights (and for some, it wouldn&apos;t matter whether there were  phone
              numbers in it or not).

       4      Use  it in &apos;lottery&apos; situations.  If you&apos;re an ISP, write a script
              to store login names and GECOS from /etc/passwd in strfile format,
              write  another  to send &apos;congratulations, you&apos;ve won&apos; to the lucky
              login selected.  The prize might be a month&apos;s free service, or  if
              you&apos;re AOL, a month free on a real service provider.

HISTORY
       The  strfile  utility  first appeared in 4.4BSD. This version was heavily
       modified, much of it in ways peculiar to Linux.  Work has since been done
       to  make  the  code more generic, and has so far been tested to work with
       SunOS 4.x.  More platforms are expected to be supported as  work  contin&#8208;
       ues.
