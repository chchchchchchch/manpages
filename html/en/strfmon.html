STRFMON(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STRFMON(3)



NAME
       strfmon - convert monetary value to a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;monetary.h&gt;

       ssize_t strfmon(char *s, size_t max, const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strfmon()  function  formats  the specified amounts according to the
       format specification format and places the result in the character  array
       s of size max.

       Ordinary  characters  in format are copied to s without conversion.  Con&#8208;
       version specifiers are introduced by a &apos;%&apos; character.   Immediately  fol&#8208;
       lowing it there can be zero or more of the following flags:

       =f     The  single-byte character f is used as the numeric fill character
              (to be used with a left precision, see below).   When  not  speci&#8208;
              fied, the space character is used.

       ^      Do  not  use any grouping characters that might be defined for the
              current locale.  By default, grouping is enabled.

       ( or + The ( flag indicates that  negative  amounts  should  be  enclosed
              between  parentheses.   The  + flag indicates that signs should be
              handled in the default way, that is, amounts are preceded  by  the
              locale&apos;s  sign  indication, for example, nothing for positive, &quot;-&quot;
              for negative.

       !      Omit the currency symbol.

       -      Left justify all fields.  The default is right justification.

       Next, there may be a field width: a decimal  digit  string  specifying  a
       minimum  field  width in bytes.  The default is 0.  A result smaller than
       this width is padded with spaces (on the left,  unless  the  left-justify
       flag was given).

       Next, there may be a left precision of the form &quot;#&quot; followed by a decimal
       digit string.  If the number of digits left of  the  radix  character  is
       smaller  than  this,  the  representation  is padded on the left with the
       numeric fill character.  Grouping characters  are  not  counted  in  this
       field width.

       Next,  there may be a right precision of the form &quot;.&quot; followed by a deci&#8208;
       mal digit string.  The amount being formatted is rounded to the specified
       number  of  digits  prior to formatting.  The default is specified in the
       frac_digits and int_frac_digits items of  the  current  locale.   If  the
       right  precision is 0, no radix character is printed.  (The radix charac&#8208;
       ter here is determined by LC_MONETARY, and may differ from that specified
       by LC_NUMERIC.)

       Finally,  the  conversion  specification  must be ended with a conversion
       character.  The three conversion characters are

       %      (In this case the entire specification must be exactly &quot;%%&quot;.)  Put
              a &apos;%&apos; character in the result string.

       i      One argument of type double is converted using the locale&apos;s inter&#8208;
              national currency format.
&#12;       n      One argument of  type  double  is  converted  using  the  locale&apos;s
              national currency format.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strfmon()  function  returns  the number of characters placed in the
       array s, not including the terminating null byte,  provided  the  string,
       including  the  terminating null byte, fits.  Otherwise, it sets errno to
       E2BIG, returns -1, and the contents of the array is undefined.

CONFORMING TO
       Not in POSIX.1-2001.  Present on several other systems.

EXAMPLE
       The call

           strfmon(buf, sizeof(buf), &quot;[%^=*#6n] [%=*#6i]&quot;,
                   1234.567, 1234.567);

       outputs

           [ fl **1234,57] [ NLG  **1 234,57]

       in the Dutch locale (with fl for  &quot;florijnen&quot;  and  NLG  for  Netherlands
       Guilders).   The grouping character is very ugly because it takes as much
       space as a digit, while it should not take more than half that, and  will
       no  doubt  cause  confusion.  Surprisingly, the &quot;fl&quot; is preceded and fol&#8208;
       lowed by a space, and &quot;NLG&quot; is preceded by one and followed by  two  spa&#8208;
       ces.   This  may  be a bug in the locale files.  The Italian, Australian,
       Swiss and Portuguese locales yield

           [ L. **1235] [ ITL  **1.235]
           [ $**1234.57] [ AUD **1,234.57]
           [Fr. **1234,57] [CHF  **1.234,57]
           [ **1234$57Esc] [ **1.234$57PTE ]
