DESCRIPTION
       This  is an implementation in Tcl of the Preparation of Internationalized
       Strings (&quot;stringprep&quot;). It allows to define stringprep profiles  and  use
       them to prepare Unicode strings for comparison as defined in RFC-3454.

COMMANDS
       ::stringprep::register  profile  ?-mapping  list?  ?-normalization  form?
       ?-prohibited list? ?-prohibitedList  list?  ?-prohibitedCommand  command?
       ?-prohibitedBidi boolean?
              Register  the  stringprep  profile  named profile. Options are the
              following.

              Option -mapping specifies stringprep mapping tables.  This parame&#8208;
              ter  takes  list  of tables from appendix B of RFC-3454. The usual
              list values are {B.1 B.2} or {B.1 B.3} where B.1 contains  charac&#8208;
              ters  which  commonly  map to nothing, B.3 specifies case folding,
              and B.2 is used in profiles with unicode  normalization  form  KC.
              Defult value is {} which means no mapping.

              Option -normalization takes a string and if it is nonempty then it
              uses as a name of Unicode normalization form. Any  value  of  &quot;D&quot;,
              &quot;C&quot;,  &quot;KD&quot;  or  &quot;KC&quot; may be used, though RFC-3454 defines only two
              options: no normalization or normalization using form KC.

              Option -prohibited takes a list of RFC-3454 tables with prohibited
              characters.  Current  version  does  allow  to prohibit either all
              tables from C.3 to C.9 or neither of them. An example of this list
              for RFC-3491 is {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}.

              Option  -prohibitedList  specifies a list of additional prohibited
              characters. The list contains not characters themselves but  their
              Unicode numbers. For example, Nodeprep specification from RFC-3920
              forbids the following codes: {0x22 0x26 0x27 0x2f 0x3a  0x3c  0x3e
              0x40} (\&quot; \&amp; \&apos; / : &lt; &gt; @).

              Option  -prohibitedCommand specifies a command which is called for
              every character code in mapped and normalized string. If the  com&#8208;
              mand  returns  true  then  the character is considered prohibited.
              This option is useful when  a  list  for  -prohibitedList  is  too
              large.

              Option  -prohibitedBidi takes boolean value and if it is true then
              the bidirectional character processing rules defined in section  6
              of RFC-3454 are used.

       ::stringprep::stringprep profile string
              Performs  stringprep  operations  defined  in  profile  profile to
              string string. Result is a prepared string or one of the following
              errors:  invalid_profile (profile profile is not defined), prohib&#8208;
              ited_character (string string contains a prohibited character)  or
              prohibited_bidi (string string contains a prohibited bidirectional
              sequence).

       ::stringprep::compare profile string1 string2
              Compares two unicode strings prepared  accordingly  to  stringprep
              profile  profile.  The  command  returns 0 if prepared strings are
              equal, -1 if string1 is lexicographically less than string2, or  1
              if string1 is lexicographically greater than string2.

EXAMPLES
       Nameprep profile definition (see RFC-3491):


              ::stringprep::register nameprep  -mapping {B.1 B.2}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedBidi 1

       Nodeprep and resourceprep profile definitions (see RFC-3920):


              ::stringprep::register nodeprep  -mapping {B.1 B.2}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.1 C.1.2 C.2.1 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedList {0x22 0x26 0x27 0x2f 0x3a 0x3c 0x3e 0x40}  -prohibitedBidi 1

              ::stringprep::register resourceprep  -mapping {B.1}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.1 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedBidi 1
