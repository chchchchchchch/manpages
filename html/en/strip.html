DESCRIPTION
       GNU strip discards all symbols from object files objfile.  The list of
       object files may include archives.  At least one object file must be
       given.

       strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing
       modified copies under different names.

OPTIONS
       -F bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Treat the original objfile as a file with the object code format
           bfdname, and rewrite it in the same format.

       --help
           Show a summary of the options to strip and exit.

       --info
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats
           available.

       -I bfdname
       --input-target=bfdname
           Treat the original objfile as a file with the object code format
           bfdname.

       -O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
           Replace objfile with a file in the output format bfdname.

       -R sectionname
       --remove-section=sectionname
           Remove any section named sectionname from the output file.  This
           option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option
           inappropriately may make the output file unusable.

       -s
       --strip-all
           Remove all symbols.

       -g
       -S
       -d
       --strip-debug
           Remove debugging symbols only.
&#12;       --strip-unneeded
           Remove all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

       -K symbolname
       --keep-symbol=symbolname
           When stripping symbols, keep symbol symbolname even if it would
           normally be stripped.  This option may be given more than once.

       -N symbolname
       --strip-symbol=symbolname
           Remove symbol symbolname from the source file. This option may be
           given more than once, and may be combined with strip options other
           than -K.

       -o file
           Put the stripped output in file, rather than replacing the existing
           file.  When this argument is used, only one objfile argument may be
           specified.

       -p
       --preserve-dates
           Preserve the access and modification dates of the file.

       -w
       --wildcard
           Permit regular expressions in symbolnames used in other command line
           options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\) and
           square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the symbol
           name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation
           point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.
           For example:

                     -w -K !foo -K fo*

           would cause strip to only keep symbols that start with the letters
           &quot;fo&quot;, but to discard the symbol &quot;foo&quot;.

       -x
       --discard-all
           Remove non-global symbols.

       -X
       --discard-locals
           Remove compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually start with L
           or ..)

       --keep-file-symbols
           When stripping a file, perhaps with --strip-debug or
           --strip-unneeded, retain any symbols specifying source file names,
           which would otherwise get stripped.

       --only-keep-debug
           Strip a file, removing contents of any sections that would not be
           stripped by --strip-debug and leaving the debugging sections intact.
           In ELF files, this preserves all note sections in the output.

           The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with
           --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part executable.  One a stripped
           binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a distribution and
           the second a debugging information file which is only needed if
           debugging abilities are required.  The suggested procedure to create
           these files is as follows:

           1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that is is called&gt;
               &quot;foo&quot; then...

           1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg&quot; to&gt;
               create a file containing the debugging info.

           1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --strip-debug foo&quot; to create a&gt;
               stripped executable.
&#12;           1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo&quot;&gt;
               to add a link to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

           Note---the choice of &quot;.dbg&quot; as an extension for the debug info file
           is arbitrary.  Also the &quot;--only-keep-debug&quot; step is optional.  You
           could instead do this:

           1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.&gt;
           1.&lt;Copy &quot;foo&quot; to &quot;foo.full&quot;&gt;
           1.&lt;Run &quot;strip --strip-debug foo&quot;&gt;
           1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo&quot;&gt;

           i.e., the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can be the full
           executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the
           --only-keep-debug switch.

           Note---this switch is only intended for use on fully linked files.
           It does not make sense to use it on object files where the debugging
           information may be incomplete.  Besides the gnu_debuglink feature
           currently only supports the presence of one filename containing
           debugging information, not multiple filenames on a one-per-object-
           file basis.

       -V
       --version
           Show the version number for strip.

       -v
       --verbose
           Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
           archives, strip -v lists all members of the archive.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
