STRCMP(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  STRCMP(3)



NAME
       strcmp, strncmp - compare two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It returns an
       integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found, respec&#8208;
       tively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.

       The  strncmp() function is similar, except it only compares the first (at
       most) n bytes of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less  than,  equal
       to,  or  greater than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found,
       respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
