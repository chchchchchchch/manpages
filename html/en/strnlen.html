STRNLEN(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STRNLEN(3)



NAME
       strnlen - determine the length of a fixed-size string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       size_t strnlen(const char *s, size_t maxlen);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       strnlen():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  strnlen() function returns the number of bytes in the string pointed
       to by s, excluding the terminating null bye (&apos;\0&apos;), but at  most  maxlen.
       In  doing  this,  strnlen() looks only at the first maxlen bytes at s and
       never beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE
       The strnlen() function returns strlen(s), if that is less than maxlen, or
       maxlen  if  there  is  no  null  byte (&apos;\0&apos;) among the first maxlen bytes
       pointed to by s.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
