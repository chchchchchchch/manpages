STRSEP(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  STRSEP(3)



NAME
       strsep - extract token from string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       char *strsep(char **stringp, const char *delim);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       strsep(): _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       If  *stringp is NULL, the strsep() function returns NULL and does nothing
       else.  Otherwise, this function finds  the  first  token  in  the  string
       *stringp,  where  tokens  are  delimited  by symbols in the string delim.
       This token is terminated by overwriting the delimiter with  a  null  byte
       (&apos;\0&apos;)  and  *stringp  is  updated  to  point past the token.  In case no
       delimiter was found, the token is taken to be the entire string *stringp,
       and *stringp is made NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       The strsep() function returns a pointer to the token, that is, it returns
       the original value of *stringp.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD.

NOTES
       The strsep() function was introduced  as  a  replacement  for  strtok(3),
       since the latter cannot handle empty fields.  However, strtok(3) conforms
       to C89/C99 and hence is more portable.

BUGS
       Be cautious when using this function.  If you do use it, note that:

       * This function modifies its first argument.

       * This function cannot be used on constant strings.

       * The identity of the delimiting character is lost.
