STRTOUL(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 STRTOUL(3)



NAME
       strtoul, strtoull, strtouq - convert a string to an unsigned long integer

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       unsigned long int strtoul(const char *nptr, char **endptr, int base);

       unsigned long long int strtoull(const char *nptr, char **endptr,
                                       int base);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       strtoull():
           XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _ISOC99_SOURCE
           || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L;
           or cc -std=c99

DESCRIPTION
       The strtoul() function converts the initial part of the string in nptr to
       an  unsigned  long  int  value according to the given base, which must be
       between 2 and 36 inclusive, or be the special value 0.

       The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space  (as  deter&#8208;
       mined  by  isspace(3)) followed by a single optional &apos;+&apos; or &apos;-&apos; sign.  If
       base is zero or 16, the string may then include a &quot;0x&quot;  prefix,  and  the
       number  will  be  read  in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken as 10
       (decimal) unless the next character is &apos;0&apos;, in which case it is taken  as
       8 (octal).

       The remainder of the string is converted to an unsigned long int value in
       the obvious manner, stopping at the first character which is not a  valid
       digit  in  the  given base.  (In bases above 10, the letter &apos;A&apos; in either
       upper or lower case represents 10, &apos;B&apos; represents 11, and so forth,  with
       &apos;Z&apos; representing 35.)

       If  endptr is not NULL, strtoul() stores the address of the first invalid
       character in *endptr.  If there were no digits at all,  strtoul()  stores
       the original value of nptr in *endptr (and returns 0).  In particular, if
       *nptr is not &apos;\0&apos; but **endptr is &apos;\0&apos; on return, the  entire  string  is
       valid.

       The  strtoull()  function  works  just  like  the  strtoul() function but
       returns an unsigned long long int value.

RETURN VALUE
       The strtoul() function returns either the result of the conversion or, if
       there was a leading minus sign, the negation of the result of the conver&#8208;
       sion represented as an unsigned value, unless the  original  (nonnegated)
       value would overflow; in the latter case, strtoul() returns ULONG_MAX and
       sets errno to ERANGE.  Precisely the  same  holds  for  strtoull()  (with
       ULLONG_MAX instead of ULONG_MAX).

ERRORS
       EINVAL (not in C99) The given base contains an unsupported value.

       ERANGE The resulting value was out of range.

       The implementation may also set errno to EINVAL in case no conversion was
       performed (no digits seen, and 0 returned).

CONFORMING TO
       strtoul() conforms to SVr4, C89, C99 and POSIX-2001,  and  strtoull()  to
       C99 and POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Since  strtoul()  can  legitimately return 0 or ULONG_MAX (ULLONG_MAX for
       strtoull()) on both success and failure, the calling program  should  set
       errno  to  0  before the call, and then determine if an error occurred by
       checking whether errno has a nonzero value after the call.

       In locales other than the &quot;C&quot; locale,  other  strings  may  be  accepted.
       (For  example,  the thousands separator of the current locale may be sup&#8208;
       ported.)

       BSD also has

           u_quad_t strtouq(const char *nptr, char **endptr, int base);

       with completely analogous definition.  Depending on the wordsize  of  the
       current  architecture,  this  may  be equivalent to strtoull() or to str&#8208;
       toul().

       Negative values are considered valid input and are silently converted  to
       the equivalent unsigned long int value.

EXAMPLE
       See  the  example  on the strtol(3) manual page; the use of the functions
       described in this manual page is similar.
