UNIMPLEMENTED(2)            Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual           UNIMPLEMENTED(2)



NAME
       afs_syscall, break, ftime, getpmsg, gtty, lock, madvise1, mpx, prof, pro&#8208;
       fil, putpmsg, security, stty, tuxcall, ulimit,  vserver  -  unimplemented
       system calls

SYNOPSIS
       Unimplemented system calls.

DESCRIPTION
       These system calls are not implemented in the Linux 2.6.22 kernel.

RETURN VALUE
       These system calls always return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS.

NOTES
       Note  that  ftime(3),  profil(3) and ulimit(3) are implemented as library
       functions.

       Some system calls, like alloc_hugepages(2), free_hugepages(2), ioperm(2),
       iopl(2), and vm86(2) only exist on certain architectures.

       Some  system  calls,  like  ipc(2), create_module(2), init_module(2), and
       delete_module(2) only exist when the Linux kernel was built with  support
       for them.
