STUBMAKER(1p)          User Contributed Perl Documentation         STUBMAKER(1p)



NAME
       stubmaker - Generates client stubs from a WSDL file.

OPTIONS
       -d &lt;dirname&gt;
           Specifies the directory you wish to output the files to. The
           directory must already exist.

       -v  Turns on &quot;verbose&quot; output during the code stub generation process. To
           be honest, there is not much the program outputs, but if you must see
           something output to the console, then this fits the bill.

       --help
           Outputs a short help message.

       --version
           Outputs the current version of stubmaker.

STUB FILES
   STUB SUBROUTINES
       The &quot;class&quot; or &quot;package&quot; created by stubmaker is actually a sub-class of
       the core SOAP::Lite object. As a result, all methods one can call upon
       SOAP::Lite one can also call upon generated stubs.

       For example, suppose you wanted to obtain readable output from the
       generated stub, then simply call readable(1) on the stub&apos;s instance. See
       the example below.

       The following subroutines are unique to generated stub classes, and help
       the user control and configure the stub class.

       want_som(boolean)
           When set to 1, SOAP::Lite will return SOAP::SOM objects to the user
           upon invoking a method on a remote service. This is very helpful when
           you need to check to see if the return value is a SOAP::Fault or not.
           When set to 0, SOAP::Lite will return the return value of the method.

EXAMPLES
   Invoking stubmaker from the command line
       &gt; perl stubmaker http://www.xmethods.net/sd/StockQuoteService.wsdl Or: &gt;
       perl &quot;-MStockQuoteService qw(:all)&quot; -le &quot;print getQuote(&apos;MSFT&apos;)&quot;

   Working with stub classes
       Command line: &gt; perl stubmaker
       http://ws1.api.re2.yahoo.com/ws/soap-demo/full.wsdl

       File: echo &gt; use full; &gt; use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; qw( debug ); &gt; my $f =
       new full; &gt; $f-&gt;use_prefix(0); &gt; $f-&gt;readable(1); &gt; $f-&gt;want_som(1); &gt;
       $som = $f-&gt;echoViaBase64(&quot;foo&quot;);
