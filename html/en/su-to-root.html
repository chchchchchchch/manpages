su-to-root(1)                Debian GNU/Linux manual               su-to-root(1)



NAME
       su-to-root  -  A  simple script to give an `interactive&apos; front-end to su.
       It can be used in menu entry commands to ask for the root password

SYNOPSIS
       su-to-root [-X] [-p &lt;user&gt;] -c &lt;command&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       Most menu entries simply start an editor or a game or whatever. But  some
       menu  entries would like to give the user the ability to change important
       settings in the system, that require root privileges.  su-to-root can  be
       used to ask for the root password.

OPTIONS
       -c &lt;command&gt;
              The command to execute as a string. This option is mandatory.

       -p &lt;user&gt;
              The name of the user to change to, instead of root.

       -X     The  command  is  a  X11 program that does not require a terminal.
              This is to be used with menu entries that declare needs=&quot;X11&quot;.

ENVIRONMENT
       SU_TO_ROOT_X
              Select the su-like program called  by  su-to-root  -X.   Supported
              values are gksu, kdesu, kde4su, ktsuss,
               sux,  gksudo  and  kdesudo.   kde4su  denotes the KDE4 version of
              kdesu.

              When this variable is not set su-to-root will currently try to use
              gksu,  kdesu,  kde4su,  ktsuss, sux and the built-in code, in that
              order with the exception that  under  a  KDE  session,  kdesu  and
              kde4su are prefered over gksu.

              The  exact  set  of  programs to try and their order is subject to
              change without notice.

       SU_TO_ROOT_SU
              Select the su-like program used in text  mode.   Supported  values
              are sudo, sux and su, the later being the default.

FILES
       /etc/su-to-rootrc

       ~/.su-to-rootrc
              su-to-root  will source these files at startup in this order. This
              lets you define and modify the environment variables above without
              restarting your X session.
