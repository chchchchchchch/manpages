SUDOREPLAY(8)                 MAINTENANCE COMMANDS                 SUDOREPLAY(8)



NAME
       sudoreplay - replay sudo session logs

SYNOPSIS
       sudoreplay [-h] [-d directory] [-f filter] [-m max_wait] [-s
       speed_factor] ID

       sudoreplay [-h] [-d directory] -l [search expression]

DESCRIPTION
       sudoreplay plays back or lists the output logs created by sudo.  When
       replaying, sudoreplay can play the session back in real-time, or the
       playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command
       line options.

       The ID should either be a six character sequence of digits and upper case
       letters, e.g. 0100A5, or a pattern matching the iolog_file option in the
       sudoers file.  When a command is run via sudo with log_output enabled in
       the sudoers file, a TSID=ID string is logged via syslog or to the sudo
       log file.  The ID may also be determined using sudoreplay&apos;s list mode.

       In list mode, sudoreplay can be used to find the ID of a session based on
       a number of criteria such as the user, tty or command run.

       In replay mode, if the standard output has not been redirected,
       sudoreplay will act on the following keys:

       &apos; &apos; (space)
               Pause output; press any key to resume.

       &apos;&lt;&apos;     Reduce the playback speed by one half.

       &apos;&gt;&apos;     Double the playback speed.

OPTIONS
       sudoreplay accepts the following command line options:

       -d directory
                   Use directory to for the session logs instead of the default,
                   /var/log/sudo-io.

       -f filter   By default, sudoreplay will play back the command&apos;s standard
                   output, standard error and tty output.  The -f option can be
                   used to select which of these to output.  The filter argument
                   is a comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of
                   following: stdout, stderr, and ttyout.

       -h          The -h (help) option causes sudoreplay to print a short help
                   message to the standard output and exit.

       -l [search expression]
                   Enable &quot;list mode&quot;.  In this mode, sudoreplay will list
                   available sessions in a format similar to the sudo log file
                   format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).  If a
                   search expression is specified, it will be used to restrict
                   the IDs that are displayed.  An expression is composed of the
                   following predicates:

                   command command pattern
                           Evaluates to true if the command run matches command
                           pattern.  On systems with POSIX regular expression
                           support, the pattern may be an extended regular
                           expression.  On systems without POSIX regular
                           expression support, a simple substring match is
                           performed instead.

                   cwd directory
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                           specified current working directory.

                   fromdate date
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run on or after
                           date.  See &quot;Date and time format&quot; for a description
                           of supported date and time formats.

                   group runas_group
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run with the
                           specified runas_group.  Note that unless a
                           runas_group was explicitly specified when sudo was
                           run this field will be empty in the log.

                   runas runas_user
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                           specified runas_user.  Note that sudo runs commands
                           as user root by default.

                   todate date
                           Evaluates to true if the command was run on or prior
                           to date.  See &quot;Date and time format&quot; for a
                           description of supported date and time formats.

                   tty tty Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                           specified terminal device.  The tty should be
                           specified without the /dev/ prefix, e.g.  tty01
                           instead of /dev/tty01.

                   user user name
                           Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run by
                           user name.

                   Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string
                   (currently all predicates may be shortened to a single
                   character).

                   Predicates may be combined using and, or and ! operators as
                   well as &apos;(&apos; and &apos;)&apos; for grouping (note that parentheses must
                   generally be escaped from the shell).  The and operator is
                   optional, adjacent predicates have an implied and unless
                   separated by an or.

       -m max_wait Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
                   presses or output data.  By default, sudo_replay will
                   accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
                   program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
                   session includes long pauses.  When the -m option is
                   specified, sudoreplay will limit these pauses to at most
                   max_wait seconds.  The value may be specified as a floating
                   point number, .e.g. 2.5.

       -s speed_factor
                   This option causes sudoreplay to adjust the number of seconds
                   it will wait between key presses or program output.  This can
                   be used to slow down or speed up the display.  For example, a
                   speed_factor of 2 would make the output twice as fast whereas
                   a speed_factor of &lt;.5&gt; would make the output twice as slow.

       -V          The -V (version) option causes sudoreplay to print its
                   version number and exit.

   Date and time format
       The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats include:

       HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.

       HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
               24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day
               names may be abbreviated.  Note that month and day of the week
               names must be specified in English.

       CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
               ISO time format

       DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
               The month name may be abbreviated.

       Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are optional.
       If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no time is
       specified, the first second of the specified date is used.  The less
       significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted, in which
       case zero is assumed.  For example, the following are all valid:

       The following are all valid time and date specifications:

       now     The current time and date.

       tomorrow
               Exactly one day from now.

       yesterday
               24 hours ago.
