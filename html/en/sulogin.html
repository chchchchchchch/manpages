SULOGIN(8)             Linux System Administrator&apos;s Manual            SULOGIN(8)



NAME
       sulogin - Single-user login

SYNOPSIS
       sulogin [ -e ] [ -p ] [ -t SECONDS ] [ TTY ]

DESCRIPTION
       sulogin is invoked by init(8) when the system goes into single user mode.
       (This is done through an entry in inittab(5).)  Init also tries  to  exe&#8208;
       cute  sulogin  when  the  boot  loader  (e.g.,  grub(8)) passes it the -b
       option.

       The user is prompted

            Give root password for system maintenance
            (or type Control-D for normal startup):

       If the root account is locked, no password prompt is displayed and  sulo&#8208;
       gin behaves as if the correct password were entered.

       sulogin  will  be  connected  to the current terminal, or to the optional
       device that can be specified on the  command  line  (typically  /dev/con&#8208;
       sole).

       If  the -t option is used then the program only waits the given number of
       seconds for user input.

       If the -p option is used then the single-user shell  is  invoked  with  a
       dash as the first character in argv[0].  This causes the shell process to
       behave as a login shell.  The default is not to  do  this,  so  that  the
       shell will not read /etc/profile or $HOME/.profile at startup.

       After  the  user exits the single-user shell, or presses control-D at the
       prompt, the system will (continue to) boot to the default runlevel.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       sulogin looks for the environment variable SUSHELL or sushell  to  deter&#8208;
       mine what shell to start. If the environment variable is not set, it will
       try to execute root&apos;s shell from /etc/passwd. If that fails it will  fall
       back to /bin/sh.

       This  is  very  valuable together with the -b option to init. To boot the
       system  into  single  user  mode,  with  the  root  file  system  mounted
       read/write,  using  a special &quot;fail safe&quot; shell that is statically linked
       (this example is valid for the LILO bootprompt)

       boot: linux -b rw sushell=/sbin/sash

FALLBACK METHODS
       sulogin checks the root password using  the  standard  method  (getpwnam)
       first.   Then,  if  the  -e  option was specified, sulogin examines these
       files directly to find the root password:

       /etc/passwd,
       /etc/shadow (if present)

       If they are damaged or nonexistent, sulogin will start a root shell with&#8208;
       out  asking  for  a  password. Only use the -e option if you are sure the
       console is physically protected against unauthorized access.
