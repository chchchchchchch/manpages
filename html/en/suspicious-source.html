SUSPICIOUS-SOURCE(1)                                        SUSPICIOUS-SOURCE(1)



NAME
       suspicious-source  -  search  for files that are not the GPL&apos;s &quot;preferred
       form of modification&quot;


SYNOPSIS
       suspicious-source [options]


DESCRIPTION
       suspicious-source is a script that outputs a list of files which are  not
       common  source files.  This should be run in the root of a source tree to
       find files which might not be the &quot;preferred form of  modification&quot;  that
       the GPL and other licenses require.

       The  files inside version control system directories (like .bzr/ or CVS/)
       are not considered.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Print more information.

       -d directory, --directory=directory
              Check the files in the specified directory instead of the  current
              directory.

       -m mimetype, --mimetype=mimetype
              Add mimetype to list of white-listed MIME types.

       -e extension, --extension=extension
              Add extension to list of white-listed extensions.

       suspicious-source  and  this  manpage have been written by Benjamin Drung
