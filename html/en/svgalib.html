0. INTRODUCTION
       This  is  a  low  level  graphics  library for Linux, originally based on
       VGAlib 1.2 by Tommy Frandsen. VGAlib supported a number of  standard  VGA
       graphics  modes, as well as Tseng ET4000 high resolution 256-color modes.
       As of now, support for many more chipsets has been added. See  section  4
       Overview of supported SVGA chipsets and modes

       It  supports  transparent  virtual  console  switching,  that is, you can
       switch consoles to  and  from  text  and  graphics  mode  consoles  using
       alt-[function key]. Also, svgalib corrects most of VGAlib&apos;s textmode cor&#8208;
       ruption behaviour by catching SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGILL,  and  other  fatal
       signals  and  ensuring that a program is running in the currently visible
       virtual console before setting a graphics mode.

       Note right here that SIGUSR1 and  SIGUSR2  are  used  to  manage  console
       switching  internally in svgalib.  You can not use them in your programs.
       If your program needs to use one of those signals, svgalib  can  be  com&#8208;
       piled to use other signals, by editing libvga.h

       This  version includes code to hunt for a free virtual console on its own
       in case you are not starting the program from one  (but  instead  over  a
       network  or modem login, from within screen(1) or an xterm(1)).  Provided
       there is a free console, this succeeds if you are root or if the  svgalib
       calling  user  own the current console. This is to avoid people not using
       the console being able to fiddle with it.  On graceful exit  the  program
       returns  to  the console from which it was started.  Otherwise it remains
       in text mode at the VC which svgalib allocated to allow you  to  see  any
       error  messages.  In  any  case,  any  I/O the svgalib makes in text mode
       (after calling vga_init(3)) will also take place at this new console.

       Alas, some games misuse their suid root privilege and run  as  full  root
       process.  svgalib  cannot  detect this and allows Joe Blow User to open a
       new VC on the console. If this  annoys  you,  ROOT_VC_SHORTCUT  in  Make&#8208;
       file.cfg  allows you to disable allocating a new VC for root (except when
       he owns the current console)  when  you  compile  svgalib.  This  is  the
       default.

       When  the  library is used by a program at run-time, first the chipset is
       detected and the appropriate driver is used. This means that  a  graphics
       program  will  work on any card that is supported by svgalib, if the mode
       it uses is supported by the chipset driver for that card. The library  is
       upwardly compatible with VGAlib.

       The  set  of  drawing  functions  provided  by  svgalib itself is limited
       (unchanged from VGAlib) and unoptimized; you  can  however  use  vga_set&#8208;
       page(3)  and vga_getgraphmem(3) (which points to the 64K VGA framebuffer)
       in a program or graphics library.  A fast external  framebuffer  graphics
       library  for  linear  and  banked  1, 2, 3 and 4 bytes per pixel modes is
       included (it also indirectly supports planar VGA modes). It is documented
       in vgagl(7).

       One  obvious  application of the library is a picture viewer. Several are
       available, along with animation viewers. See the 7. References at the end
       of this document.

       I  have  added  a  simple VGA textmode font restoration utility (restore&#8208;
       font(1)) which may help if you suffer from XFree86 textmode font  corrup&#8208;
       tion. It can also be used to change the textmode font. It comes with some
       other  textmode  utilities:  restoretextmode(1)   (which   saves/restores
       textmode  registers),  restorepalette(1), and the script textmode(1).  If
       you run the savetextmode(1) script to save textmode information to  /tmp,
       you&apos;ll be able to restore textmode by running the textmode(1) script.


1. INSTALLATION
       Installation is easy in general but there are many options and things you
       should keep in mind.  This  document  however  assumes  that  svgalib  is
       already installed.

       If  you  need  information on installation see 0-INSTALL which comes with
       the svgalib distribution.

       However, even after installation of the library you might need to config&#8208;
       ure  svgalib  using  the file /etc/vga/libvga.config.  Checkout section 4
       Overview of supported SVGA chipsets and modes  and  libvga.config(5)  for
       information.


2. HOW TO USE SVGALIB
       For  basic svgalib usage (no mouse, no raw keyboard) add #include &lt;vga.h&gt;
       at the beginning your program.  Use vga_init(3)  as  your  first  svgalib
       call.  This will give up root privileges right after initialization, mak&#8208;
       ing setuid-root binaries relatively safe.

       The  function  vga_getdefaultmode(3)  checks  the  environment   variable
       SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE  for  a  default mode, and returns the corresponding
       mode number. The environment string can either be a mode number or a mode
       name   as  in  (G640x480x2,  G640x480x16,  G640x480x256  ,  G640x480x32K,
       G640x480x64K, G640x480x16M).  As an example, to set the default  graphics
       mode to 640x480, 256 colors, use:

       export SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE=G640x480x256

       on  the  bash(1)  command line. If a program needs just a linear VGA/SVGA
       resolution (as required by vgagl(7)), only modes where  bytesperpixel  in
       the  vga_modeinfo  structure returned by vga_getmodeinfo(3) is greater or
       equal to 1 should be accepted (this is 0 for tweaked planar 256-color VGA
       modes).

       Use  vga_setmode(graphicsmode)  to  set  a  graphics  mode.  Use vga_set&#8208;
       mode(TEXT) to restore textmode before program exit.

       Programs that use svgalib must #include&lt;vga.h&gt;;  if  they  also  use  the
       external  graphics  library  vgagl(7),  you  must also #include&lt;vgagl.h&gt;.
       Linking must be done with -lvga (and -lvgagl before -lvga, if vgagl(7) is
       used).  You  can save binary space by removing the unused chipset drivers
       in Makefile.cfg if you only use specific chipsets. However  this  reduces
       the flexibility of svgalib and has a significant effect only when you use
       the static libraries. You should better  use  the  shared  libraries  and
       these will load only the really used parts anyway.

       Functions  in  the  vgagl(7)  library  have  the  prefix gl_.  Please see
       vgagl(7) for details.

       There are demos with sources available which will also help  to  get  you
       started,  in  recommended  order  of  interest:  vgatest(6),  keytest(6),
       mousetest(6),  eventtest(6),  forktest(6),   bg_test(6),   scrolltest(6),
       speedtest(6),  fun(6),  spin(6),  testlinear(6),  lineart(6),  testgl(6),
       accel(6), testaccel(6), plane(6), and wrapdemo(6).

       Debugging your programs will turn out to be rather difficult, because the
       svgalib  application  can  not  restore  textmode  when it returns to the
       debugger.

       Happy are the users with a serial terminal, X-station, or another way  to
       log into the machine from network. These can use

       textmode &lt;/dev/ttyN

       on the console where the program runs and continue.

       However,  the  vga_flip(3)  function  allows you to switch to textmode by
       entering a call to it blindly into your debugger when your program  stops
       in  graphics  mode.  vga_flip(3) is not very robust though. You shall not
       call it when svgalib is not yet initialized or in textmode.

       Before continuing your program, you must then call vga_flip(3)  again  to
       return to graphics mode. If the program will not make any screen accesses
       or svgalib calls before it returns to the debugger, you can omit that, of
       course.

       This will only work if your program and the debugger run in the same vir&#8208;
       tual linux console.

4. OVERVIEW OF SUPPORTED SVGA CHIPSETS AND MODES
   VGA and compatibles
       320x200x256, and the series of 16-color and non-standard planar 256 color
       modes supported by VGAlib, as well as 720x348x2.


   ALI2301
       Supports 640x480x256, 800x600x256, 1024x768x256 SVGA modes


   AT3D (AT25)
       Also  known  as  Promotion  at25. Popular as the 2D part of a voodoo rush
       card. As of this writing there are a few known problems with this driver.
       Read below.


   ARK Logic ARK1000PV/2000PV
       Full  support,  limited  RAMDAC  support. Only ARK1000PV tested. Supports
       Clocks and Ramdac lines in config file.


   ATI SVGA (VGA Wonder and friends)
       This is no real driver. I do not support any new modes.  However it saves
       additional  card  setup  and  thus allows use of the plain VGA modes even
       when you are using non standard text modes. It is possible to enforce use
       of this driver even on ATI Mach32 but not very useful.


   ATI Mach32
       The  driver  by  Michael  Weller  supports all ATI BIOS-defined modes and
       more... It hits the best out of your card.  Some modes may not have  nice
       default  timings but it uses the ATI&apos;s EEPROM for custom config or allows
       to specify modes in libvga.config(5).  Some problems may occur with quite
       some  third  party  cards  (usually on board) Mach32 based controllers as
       they do not completely conform to the  Mach32  data  sheets.   Check  out
       svgalib.mach32(7) (and libvga.config(5)).


   ATI Mach64 (rage)
       A driver for ATi Mach64 based cards with internal DAC.


   Chips  and Technologies chipsets 65525, 65535, 65546, 65548, 65550, and 65554
       (usually in laptops).
       This server was written using the SVGALIB patch from  Sergio  and  Angelo
       Masci  as  a starting point. This version of the code resembled the XFree
       server code that was used up to XFree 3.1.2. As such it was incapable  of
       programming  the  clocks,  using  linear addressing, Hi-Color, True-Color
       modes or the hardware acceleration. All of these features have since been
       added  to  the  code.  The 64200 and 64300 chips are unsupported, however
       these chips are very similar to the 6554x chips which are supported.


   Cirrus Logic GD542x/3x
       All the modes, including 256 color, 32K/64K color, 16M color (3 bytes per
       pixel) and 32-bit pixel 16M color modes (5434). Some bitblt functions are
       supported.  The driver doesn&apos;t work with mode  dumps,  but  uses  a  SVGA
       abstraction with mode timings like the X drivers.


   Genoa(?) GVGA6400 cards.
       Supported.


   Hercules Stingray 64/Video
       Is supported as an ARK2000PV


   NV3 driver for the Riva128.
       This  driver  was written by Matan Ziv-Av and is derived from the XFree86
       driver by David J. Mckay. It lacks 24bit modes (can the card do  them  at
       all?), acceleration support and pageflipping in threeDKit is broken.


   Oak Technologies OTI-037/67/77/87
       Driver by Christopher Wiles; includes 32K color modes for OTI-087.
&#12;   S3
       The driver is not complete, but should work on a number of cards/RAMDACs,
       and 640x480x256 should work on most card.  The  best  support  is  for  a
       801/805  with  AT&amp;T20C490-compatible  RAMDAC,  and  S3-864  +  SDAC.  All
       256/32K/64K/16M works for them (within the bounds of video memory &amp;  ram&#8208;
       dac restrictions).

       The supported cards include S3 Virge and S3 Trio64 cards.

       None of the acceleration function is supported yet.

       The chip level code should work with the 964/868/968, but most likely the
       card they come on would use an unsupported  ramdac/clock  chip.   Support
       for these chips is slowly being added.

       Clocks and Ramdac lines in libvga.config(5) supported.

       The  maximum  pixel  clock (in MHz) of the ramdac can be set using a Dac&#8208;
       speed line in the config file. A reasonable default  is  assumed  if  the
       Dacspeed  line is omitted.  Clocks should be the same as in XFree86. Sup&#8208;
       ported  ramdac  IDs:  Sierra32K,  SC15025,   SDAC,   GenDAC,   ATT20C490,
       ATT20C498, IBMRGB52x.

       Example:
       Clocks 25.175 28.3 40 70 50 75 36 44.9 0 118 77 31.5 110 65 72 93.5
       Ramdac att20c490
       DacSpeed 85

       Also  supported,  at least in combination with the SC15025/26A ramdac, is
       the ICD 2061A clock chip.  Since it cannot be autodetected  you  need  to
       define  it  in the config file using a Clockchip line. As there is no way
       to read the current settings out of the 2061,  you  have  the  option  to
       specify  the  frequency  used  when switching back to text mode as second
       argument in the Clockchip line.

       This is especially required if your text mode  is  an  132  column  mode,
       since  these modes use a clock from the clock chip, while 80 column modes
       use a fixed clock of 25 MHz.  The text mode frequency defaults to 40 MHz,
       if omitted.

       Example:
       ClockChip icd2061a 40.0


   Trident TVGA 8900C/9000 (and possibly also 8800CS/8900A/B) and also TVGA 9440
       Derived   from  tvgalib  by  Toomas  Losin.  TVGA  9440  support  by  ARK
       &lt;ark@lhq.com, root@ark.dyn.ml.or&gt;.

       Supports 640x480x256,  800x600x256,  1024x768x256  (interlaced  and  non-
       interlaced)  Might  be  useful  to add 16-color modes (for those equipped
       with a 512K TVGA9000) for the 8900 and 9000 cards.

       320x200x{32K, 64K, 16M}, 640x480x{256, 32K, 64K, 16M}, 800x600x{256, 32K,
       64K, 16M}, 1024x768x{16, 256}, 800x600x{16, 256, 32K, 64K} modes are sup&#8208;
       ported for the TVGA 9440.

       Autodetection can be forced with a:

              chipset TVGA memory flags

       line in the config file.

       memory is the amount of VGA memory in KB,  flags  is  composed  of  three
       bits:

              bit2 = false, bit1 = false
                     force 8900.

              bit2 = false, bit1 = true
                     force 9440.

              bit2 = true, bit1 = false
                     force 9680.

              bit0 = true
                     force noninterlaced.

              bit0 = false
                     force interlaced which only matters on 8900&apos;s with at least
                     1M since there is no 512K interlaced mode on  the  8900  or
                     any of the other cards.


   Tseng ET4000/ET4000W32(i/p)
       Derived  from VGAlib; not the same register values.  ET4000 register val&#8208;
       ues are not compatible; see svgalib.et4000(7).

       Make sure the colors are right  in  hicolor  mode;  the  vgatest  program
       should  draw  the same color bars for 256 and hicolor modes (the DAC type
       is defined at compilation in et4000.regs or the dynamic registers  file).
       ET4000/W32  based  cards usually have an AT&amp;T or Sierra 15025/6 DAC. With
       recent W32p based cards, you might have some luck with the AT&amp;T DAC type.
       If  the  high resolution modes don&apos;t work, you can try dumping the regis&#8208;
       ters in DOS using the program in the et4000/ directory and  putting  them
       in  a  file  (/etc/vga/libvga.et4000  is  parsed at runtime if DYNAMIC is
       defined in Makefile.cfg at compilation (this is default)).

       Supported modes are 640x480x256, 800x600x256, 1024x768x256,  640x480x32K,
       800x600x32K, 640x480x16M, etc.

       Reports of ET4000/W32i/p functionality are welcome.

       There  may be a problem with the way the hicolor DAC register is handled;
       dumped registers may use one of two timing methods, with the value  writ&#8208;
       ten  to  the  register  for  a  particular  DAC  for  a  hicolor mode (in
       vgahico.c) being correct for just one of the these methods. As  a  conse&#8208;
       quence some dumped resolutions may work while others don&apos;t.


   Tseng ET6000
       Most  modes  of  which the card is capable are supported.  The 8 15 16 24
       and 32 bit modes are supported.

       The ET6000 has a built in DAC and there is no problem  coming  from  that
       area.  The ET6000 is capable of acceleration, but this as well as sprites
       are not yet implemented in the driver.

       The driver now uses modelines in libvga.config for  user  defined  modes.
       It  is sometimes useful to add a modeline for a resolution which does not
       display well.  For example, the G400x600 is too far to the right  of  the
       screen  using  standard  modes.   This  is corrected by including in lib&#8208;
       vga.config the line

       Modeline &quot;400x600@72&quot;  25.000 400  440  488  520   600  639  644  666

       More examples are given below.

       This driver was provided by Don Secrest.


   VESA
       Please read README.vesa and README.lrmi in doc subdirectory of the  stan&#8208;
       dard distribution.

       Go  figure!  I  turned off autodetection in the release, as a broken bios
       will be called too, maybe crashing the  machine.  Enforce  VESA  mode  by
       putting a chipset VESA in the end of your libvga.config(5).

       Note  that  it  will leave protected mode and call the cards bios opening
       the door to many hazards.


5. DETAILED COMMENTS ON CERTAIN DEVICE DRIVERS
       This section contains detailed information  by  the  authors  on  certain
       chipsets.


   AT3D (AT25)
       Also  known  as  Promotion  at25. Popular as the 2D part of a voodoo rush
       card.

       I have written a driver for this chipset, based on the  XF86  driver  for
       this chipset.

       The  programs  that work with this driver include all the programs in the
       demos directory, zgv and dvisvga (tmview).

       I believe it should be easy to make it work on AT24, AT6422.


   ATI Mach32
       Please see svgalib.mach32(7).


   ATI Mach64
       The rage.c driver works only on mach64 based  cards  with  internal  DAC.
       The  driver  might misdetect the base frequency the card uses, so if when
       setting any svgalib modes the screen blanks, or complains  about  out  of
       bound frequencies, or the display is unsynced, then try adding the option
       RageDoubleClock to the config file.


   Chips and Technologies chipsets 65525, 65535, 65546, 65548, 65550, and  65554
       (usually in laptops).
       Please see svgalib.chips(7).


   Tseng ET4000/ET4000W32(i/p)
       Please see svgalib.et4000(7).
&#12;
   Tseng ET6000
       I have only 2 Mbytes of memory on my ET6000 card, so I am not able to get
       all possible modes running. I haven&apos;t even tried to do all of  the  modes
       which  I  am  capable of doing, but I am confident that I can manage more
       modes when I have time. I have enough modes working to make the card use&#8208;
       ful, so I felt it was worth while to add the driver to svgalib now.

       Linear graphics is working on this card, both with and without BACKGROUND
       enabled, and vga_runinbackground works.

       I decided it was best to quit working on more modes and try to get accel&#8208;
       eration and sprites working.

       My  et6000  card  is  on a PCI bus.  The card will run on a vesa bus, but
       since I don&apos;t have one on my machine I couldn&apos;t  develop  vesa  bus  han&#8208;
       dling.  I quit if the bus is a vesa bus.

       I  check  for  an et6000 card, which can be unequivocally identified. The
       et4000 driver does not properly identify  et4000  cards.  It  thinks  the
       et6000 card is an et4000, but can only run it in vga modes.

       I  have  found the following four modelines to be useful in libvga.config
       or in ~/.svgalibrc for proper display of some modes.

       Modeline &quot;512x384@79&quot; 25.175 512 560 592 640  384 428 436 494
       Modeline &quot;400x300@72&quot; 25.000 400 456 472 520  300 319 332 350 DOUBLESCAN
       Modeline &quot;512x480@71&quot; 25.175 512 584 600 656  480 500 510 550
       Modeline &quot;400x600@72&quot; 25.000 400 440 488 520  600 639 644 666

   Oak Technologies OTI-037/67/77/87
       First  a  few  comments  of  me  (Michael  Weller   &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;):

       As  of  this  writing  (1.2.8) fixes were made to the oak driver by Frodo
       Looijaard &lt;frodol@dds.nl&gt; to reenable  OTI-067  support.  It  is  unknown
       right  now  if  they might have broken OTI-087 support. The author of the
       &apos;87 support Christopher  Wiles  &lt;wileyc@moscow.com&gt;  owns  no  longer  an
       OTI-087  card and can thus no longer give optimal support to this driver.
       Thus you might be better off contacting me or Frodo for questions. If you
       are  a knowledgeable OTI-087 user and experience problems you are welcome
       to provide fixes.  No user of a OTI-087 is currently known to me,  so  if
       you  are  able  to fix problems with the driver please do so (and contact
       me) as noone else can.

       Michael.

       Now back to the original Oak information:

       The original OTI driver, which supported the OTI-067/77  at  640x480x256,
       has been augmented with the following features:


       1)     Supported  resolutions/colors  have  been expanded to 640x480x32K,
              800x600x256/32K, 1024x768x256, and 1280x1024x16.

       2)     The OTI-087 (all variants) is now supported.  Video memory is cor&#8208;
              rectly recognized.

       The  driver  as  it exists now is somewhat schizoid.  As the &apos;87 incorpo&#8208;
       rates a completely different set of extended registers, I found it neces&#8208;
       sary  to  split  its  routines  from the others.  Further, I did not have
       access to either a &apos;67 or a &apos;77 for  testing  the  new  resolutions.   If
       using  them  causes your monitor/video card to fry, your dog to bite you,
       and so forth, I warned you.  The driver works on my &apos;87, and that&apos;s all I
       guarantee.  Period.

       Heh.  Now, if someone wants to try them out ... let me know if they work.

       New from last release:

       32K  modes now work for 640x480 and 800x600.  I found that the Sierra DAC
       information in VGADOC3.ZIP is, well, wrong.  But, then again, the  infor&#8208;
       mation for the &apos;87 was wrong also.

       64K modes do not work.  I can&apos;t even get Oak&apos;s BIOS to enter those modes.

       I have included a 1280x1024x16 mode, but I haven&apos;t tested it.  My monitor
       can&apos;t handle that resolution.  According to  the  documentation,  with  2
       megs  the &apos;87 should be able to do an interlaced 1280x1024x256 ... again,
       I couldn&apos;t get the BIOS to do the mode.  I  haven&apos;t  2  megs  anyway,  so
       there it sits.

       I  have  included  routines  for  entering and leaving linear mode.  They
       should work, but they don&apos;t.  It looks like a pointer to the frame buffer
       is  not  being passed to SVGALIB.  I&apos;ve been fighting with this one for a
       month.  If anyone wants to play with this, let me know if it can be  make
       to work.  I&apos;ve got exams that I need to pass.

       Tidbit:  I pulled the extended register info out of the video BIOS.  When
       the information thus obtained failed to work, I procured the OTI-087 data
       book.   It  appears  that Oak&apos;s video BIOS sets various modes incorrectly
       (e.g. setting 8-bit color as 4, wrong dot clock frequencies, etc.).  Sort
       of makes me wonder ...

6. GOALS
       I  think  the  ability  to use a VGA/SVGA graphics resolution in one vir&#8208;
       tual   console, and being able to switch to any other virtual console and
       back  makes a fairly useful implementation of graphics modes in the Linux
       console.

       Programs that use svgalib must be setuid root. I don&apos;t know how desirable
       it  is  to have this changed; direct port access can hardly be done with&#8208;
       out. Root privileges can now be given up right  after  initialization.  I
       noticed  some  unimplemented stuff in the kernel header files that may be
       useful, although doing all register I/O via the kernel would incur a sig&#8208;
       nificant  context-switching  overhead.  An alternative might be to have a
       pseudo /dev/vga device that yields the required permissions when  opened,
       the device being readable by programs in group vga.

       It  is  important  that textmode is restored properly and reliably; it is
       fairly reliable at the moment, but fast console switching back and  forth
       between  two  consoles  running graphics can give problems.  Wild virtual
       console switching also sometimes corrupts the contents  of  the  textmode
       screen  buffer  (not  the textmode registers or font).  Also if a program
       crashes it may write into the area where the saved textmode registers are
       stored,  causing  textmode  not be restored correctly. It would be a good
       idea to somehow store this information in a &apos;safe&apos;  area  (say  a  kernel
       buffer). Note that the vga_safety_fork(3) thing has the same idea.

       Currently,  programs that are in graphics mode are suspended while not in
       the current virtual console. Would it be a good idea to let them  run  in
       the  background, virtualizing framebuffer actions (this should not be too
       hard for linear banked SVGA modes)? It would be nice to have, say, a ray&#8208;
       tracer  with  a  real-time  display  run in the background (although just
       using a separate real-time viewing program is much more elegant).

       Anyone wanting to rewrite it all in a cleaner way (something  with  load&#8208;
       able  kernel  modules  shouldn&apos;t  hurt  performance  with  linear  frame&#8208;
       buffer/vgagl type applications) is encouraged.

       Also, if anyone feels really strongly about a low-resource and  truecolor
       supporting  graphical window environment with cut-and-paste, I believe it
       would be surprisingly little work to come up with a simple but very  use&#8208;
       ful  client-server  system with shmem, the most useful applications being
       fairly trivial to write  (e.g.  shell  window,   bitmap  viewer).     And
       many X apps would port trivially.

       This is old information, please be sure to read svgalib.faq(7) if you are
       interested in further goals.


7. REFERENCES
       The latest  version  of  svgalib  can  be  found  on  sunsite.unc.edu  in
       /pub/Linux/libs/graphics  or tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/sources/libs as
       svgalib-X.X.X.tar.gz.   As  of  this  writing  the  latest   version   is
       svgalib-1.4.1.tar.gz.   There  are countless mirrors of these ftp servers
       in the world. Certainly a server close to you will carry it.

       The       original       VGAlib       is        on        tsx-11.mit.edu,
       pub/linux/sources/libs/vgalib12.tar.Z.   tvgalib-1.0.tar.Z is in the same
       directory.

       SLS has long been distributing an old version of VGAlib.  Slackware keeps
       a  fairly  up-to-date version of svgalib, but it may be installed in dif&#8208;
       ferent directories from what svgalib likes to do by default. The  current
       svgalib   install   tries  to  remove  most  of  this.  It  also  removes
       /usr/bin/setmclk and /usr/bin/convfont,  which  is  a  security  risk  if
       setuid-root. Actually the recent makefiles try to do a really good job to
       cleanup the mess which some distributions make.

       If you want to recompile the a.out shared library, you will need the  DLL
       &apos;tools&apos; package (found on tsx-11.mit.edu, GCC dir).  To make it work with
       recent ELF compiler&apos;s you actually need to  hand  patch  it.  You  should
       probably  not try to compile it. Compiling the ELF library is deadly sim&#8208;
       ple.

       And here is a list of other references which is horribly outdated.  There
       are  many more svgalib applications as well as the directories might have
       changed.  However, these will give you a start point and  names  to  hunt
       for on CD&apos;s or in ftp archives.

   Docs
       In the vga directory of the SIMTEL MSDOS collection, there is  a  package
       called vgadoc3 which is a collection of VGA/SVGA register information.

       The XFree86 driver sources distributed with the link-kit may be helpful.


   Miscellaneous
       There&apos;s an alternative RAW-mode keyboard library by Russell Marks for use
       with svgalib on sunsite.unc.edu.

       LIBGRX, the extensive framebuffer library by Csaba Biegl distributed with
       DJGPP,  has been ported to Linux. Contact Hartmut Schirmer (phc27@rz.uni-
       kiel.d400.de, subject prefix  &quot;HARTMUT:&quot;).  A  more  up-to-date  port  by
       Daniel Jackson (djackson@icomp.intel.com) is on sunsite.unc.edu.

       The  vgalib  ghostscript  device  driver  sources  can  be  found on sun&#8208;
       site.unc.edu, /pub/Linux/apps/graphics.  Ghostscript patches from  Slack&#8208;
       ware:  ftp.cdrom.com,  /pub/linux/misc.   gnuplot  patches  are  on  sun&#8208;
       site.unc.edu.

       Mitch D&apos;Souza has written font functions that work in 16 color modes  and
       can  use  VGA textmode (codepage format) fonts; these can be found in his
       g3fax package in sunsite.unc.edu.  These functions may go  into  a  later
       version of svgalib.


8. KNOWN BUGS
       This  section  is  most  probably outdated, none of these problems are no
       longer reported.

       Using a 132 column textmode may cause graphics modes to fail.  Try  using
       something like 80x28.

       The console switching doesn&apos;t preserve some registers that may be used to
       draw in planar VGA modes.

       Wild console switching can cause the text screen to be  corrupted,  espe&#8208;
       cially when switching between two graphics consoles.

       On  ET4000,  having  run  XFree86 may cause high resolution modes to fail
       (this is more XFree86&apos;s fault).

       The Trident probing routine in the XFree86 server may cause standard  VGA
       modes  to  fail after exiting X on a Cirrus. Try putting a &apos;Chipset&apos; line
       in your Xconfig to avoid the Trident probe, or use the link kit to  build
       a  server  without  the Trident driver. Saving and restoring the textmode
       registers with savetextmode/textmode (restoretextmode) should also  work.
       [Note:  svgalib  now resets the particular extended register, but only if
       the Cirrus driver is used (i.e. the chipset is not forced to VGA)]  [This
       is fixed in XFree86 v2.1]

       Some Paradise VGA cards may not work even in standard VGA modes. Can any&#8208;
       one confirm this?

       Piping data into a graphics program has problems. I am not  sure  why.  A
       pity,  since  zcatting a 5Mb FLC file into flip on a 4Mb machine would be
       fun.

       The tseng3.exe DOS program include as source in the svgalib  distribution
       doesn&apos;t recognize any modes on some ET4000 cards.  Also ET4000 cards with
       a Acumos/Cirrus DAC may only work correctly in 64K color mode.
