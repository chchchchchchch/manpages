0. INTRODUCTION
       The  driver  should  allow  you to use any of the graph-modes your Mach32
       card supports. Note that there is no support for &lt;8bpp modes and  that  I
       won&apos;t  ever  implement  that because I don&apos;t see any reason for doing so.
       All standard VGA-modes are supported, of course (by  using  the  standard
       VGA driver routines).

       If you configured your Mach32 for a memory aperture and it is at least as
       big as the memory of your card (that is, not a 1MB memory aperture for  a
       2MB card) support for linear frame buffer access of svgalib is given.

       Auto  detection  of  the  Mach32  seems  not to work on all cards. That&apos;s
       really strange since I got the code from the X people. It  should  be  OK
       regardless  of  my docs. Well, I fixed that (hopefully). Actually the bug
       was found by Daniel  Lee  Jackson  (djackson@ichips.intel.com).   (Thanks
       again.. It was so silly... I would have never found it) If you still have
       problems just put a chipset Mach32 in your config file.


1. SPECIFYING PIXEL CLOCKS
       WARNING!  The Mach32 driver needs to know correct clock  frequencies  for
       graceful  DAC  configuration. Wrong clocks may damage your card! However,
       this version contains code for automatic  clock  detection.  Since  clock
       detection  is  time  critical,  please do it on a completely idle system.
       Then put the printed out clocks line in your libvga.config(5) file.

       The driver tries to do this for you.  After that, you can  restart  what&#8208;
       ever  svgalib  program  you  used  and  you are set. If you already put a
       clocks line in your config by hand, comment it out  to  have  the  driver
       check your clocks.

       Since  clock  probing  is time critical, values differ from time to time,
       you may try it multiple times and see which values seem to be most exact.
       You  can also compare them with the standard clock chips for Mach32 cards
       in libvga.config(5)).

       The clock probing relies on the 7th clock being 44.9MHz as this  is  what
       Xfree  does.   If  this  is  not  true (and it is not always), probing is
       hosed. See libvga.config(5) for a list  of  the  clocks  used  by  common
       svgalib cards.

3. THE MACH32INFO UTILITY
       The mach32info(6) utility or demo reads out all  configuration  registers
       and  the  configuration EEPROM of your Mach32 card. If there is a problem
       with the particular card you have, compile and run  the  utility  in  the
       mach32/  directory of the svgalib distribution and send it&apos;s stdout to me
       This might also be useful if you need a lot of options  (e.g.  clocks  on
       new  models?) to get it to work so that this can be done automatically in
       future versions.


4. THIRD PARTY CARDS
       I got a few reports about AST systems with onboard Mach32.  They do  fea&#8208;
       ture  an incompatible EEPROM setup, but I think I got around that. Never&#8208;
       theless the Mach32 chipset driver doesn&apos;t work out of the box on any  AST
       system I heard of.

       Since  original  ATI  Mach32  demos and tools don&apos;t work as well, I&apos;ve to
       claim that the Mach32 on these AST systems  does  not  conform  to  ATI&apos;s
       Mach32  docs.   Fortunately,  Vernon  C.  Hoxie &lt;vern@zebra.alphacdc.com&gt;
       found a work around after years (really!) of  investigating.  AST  Mach32
       seems  to  work now. The work around was also submitted to Xfree and will
       be incorporated to allow running it on the AST  hardware  too  in  recent
       versions. Please read on the misc_ctl command below.

       Dell  users should have a look at the vendor, ramdac, and svgaclocks com&#8208;
       mands below (if they have problems with the default settings).


   Commands to support third party cards
       I had to learn that those cards seem to use not only non standard  clocks
       for  the  Mach32,  but  also for the included SVGA. However, since people
       often like to use proprietary, non standard VGA (read 80x25) text  modes,
       the  Mach32 driver has to set the included SVGA to a VGA compatible clock
       frequency. Otherwise svgalib has problems using  plain  VGA  modes.  This
       screws  VGA modes up if these clocks have different values on third party
       Mach32 cards.


       svgaclocks n
              with n a number between 0 and 31 to select the svga clocks  to  be
              used  in  vga  modes. The bits of n refer to specific ATI register
              bits to complicated to explain here. Even if I would, I can&apos;t tell
              which  clocks they would select on your third party card (which is
              the actual problem)

              svgaclocks 9 is the default setting and correct for  original  ATI
              cards.

              Often svgaclocks 0 (Dell cards) works.

       svgaclocks keep
              is  special  in  that  the driver will not touch any SVGA timings.
              This requires the Mach32 SVGA part to be in a VGA compatible  mode
              when  the  svgalib  application  is started, that is, you must use
              80x25 (maybe 80x50) console text modes.

       As I mentioned already, Vernon C. Hoxie &lt;vern@zebra.alphacdc.com&gt;  really
       seems  to have located the reason for the Mach32 AST problems. Any access
       to MISC_CTL locks up the card &amp; system. Fortunately MISC_CTL is only used
       for some DAC fine tuning (actually the setting you can fine tune with the
       blank command) which is only of barely noticeable effect to the screen.

       The following configuration commands exist to support AST cards:


       misc_ctl keep-off
              Do not dare to touch MISC_CTL.

       misc_ctl use
              Use it for fine tuning of the Ramdac setup (default).

       Finally, for your convenience there exist:

       vendor ati
       vendor dell
       vendor ast
              These are macros that expand to settings for  svgaclocks,  ramdac,
              misc_ctl, and mach32eeprom that are usually correct for ATI, Dell,
              AST cards. Be aware that they really work like  macros.  That  is,
              they  override  any  setting  of svgaclocks, ramdac, misc_ctl, and
              mach32eeprom made before  them  and  individual  aspects  will  be
              changed   by   a   following  svgaclocks,  ramdac,  misc_ctl,  and
              mach32eeprom command.

              Note that the mach32eeprom ignore required  for  some  Dell  cards
              requires  you  to  include explicit timings for Mach32 modes other
              than 640x480x256.  The mach32/mach32.std-modes file in the svgalib
              distribution contains recommendations for modes from ATI.

              I  heard  about  a bug in some ATI chipsets returning wrong memory
              amounts configs. (But cannot confirm that)

              You can enforce correct chipset identification from the configura&#8208;
              tion file:


       chipset Mach32 chiptype memory
              where chiptype is the sum of at exactly one value from each of the
              following two groups

              128    use no memory aperture.
              160    use a 1MB memory aperture.
              192    use a 4MB memory aperture.
              0      choose size for the memory aperture automatically.

              and

              16     Ramdac is of type 0 (ATI68830)
              17     Ramdac is of type 1 (IMS-G173, SC11486)
              18     Ramdac is of type 2 (ATI68875, TLC34075)
              19     Ramdac is of type 3 (INMOS176, INMOS178)
              20     Ramdac is of type 4 (Bt481, Bt482)
              21     Ramdac is of type 5 (ATI68860)
              0      Ramdac type is queried from Mach32 chip.


              memory is the amount of video memory in KB.

       Note that the type of the ramdac can be set more  conveniently  with  the
       ramdac command.
&#12;
5. LOGICAL LINEWIDTH
       At  least  my  VRAM  card  seems  to  be very peculiar about logical line
       widths. From my experience a multiple of 64 pels is needed.  Your mileage
       may  vary.  Use  the config file options to adjust it and tell me if your
       card needs a different value. Include the name and model  number  of  the
       card  and  what the correct numbers should be. This is so that I can cor&#8208;
       rect the auto configuration of the driver.

       If some svgalib application has problems, note that  you  can  force  the
       logical  line  width  to the default value from the config file. Probably
       this will lead to glitches in some 800x600 resolutions. You  can  inhibit
       these resolutions from the config file as well. Apropos glitches, I found
       no guidelines as to what clock rates to use due to memory restrictions. I
       adjusted  the  driver,  such  that I get a stable pic in all resolutions.
       However sometimes the screen is disturbed by heavy video memory accesses.
       If  you  don&apos;t  like  that, reduce the clocks used with the maxclock16 or
       maxclock24 command, resp.  This may of course lead to none of the  prede&#8208;
       fined modes being used.  Then you can try to define your own mode via the
       define command.


6. NOISY VIDEO SIGNALS
       If you get some flicker or heavy noise on your screen, some  fine  tuning
       may  be  needed.  My  docs  didn&apos;t give me hints as to what each card can
       stand.  Especially DRAM cards may give  problems  (I&apos;ve  VRAM).  In  that
       case,  use the fine tuning config commands and send me your results along
       with the output of mach32info(6).  Then I can include  them  in  my  next
       release.


   Fine-tuning configuration commands
       First  you  should  think  about  the maxclock* configuration commands to
       reduce pixel clocks used for each color depth.

       Especially important for DRAM cards is the video FIFO depth used to queue
       memory  values  for  writing to the screen. Here is a command to set this
       value for the 8bpp modes:


       vfifo8 number
              where number is in range 0 - 15.  The default is now 6.

              Since vfifo is of some impact to the speed of the  card,  tell  me
              the lowest setting that satisfies your card.

              For 16/24/32 modes, there are non-zero values preset from internal
              tables and the EEPROM, however you can enforce minimal vfifo  val&#8208;
              ues with:

       vfifo16 number
       vfifo24 number
       vfifo32 number


       blank number
              where  number  is 4 * pixel_delay + blank_adjust where pixel_delay
              and blank_adjust are in range 0 .. 3.  pixel_delay  delays  pixels
              before they are sent to the DAC and blank_adjust adjusts the blank
              pulse for type 2 DAC&apos;s.  blank should be set  correctly  for  each
              DAC type automatically.  So use it only as a last resort.


       latch number
              where number is the sum of zero or more of the following numbers:
&#12;              128    VRAM  serial  delay  latch  enable,  DRAM latch bits 63 - 0
                     enable.

              4096   Latch video memory data.

              8192   Memory data delay latch enable for data bits 63 - 0.

              16384  Memory full clock pulse enable.

              Default is to switch all settings on (they are on on  my  card  by
              default anyway).

       Note  that these commands may vanish again once they are no longer needed
       for debugging purposes.

       There is no 320x200 mode in the EEPROM of the Mach32 at  all,  however  I
       defined  one  in the default configuration file for you. This is the best
       thing I could get up on my card/screen. Note that it will  probably  have
       big  borders  on your screen, and black lines in between the pixel lines.
       This is because of the lack of low clocks &lt; 16MHz on the Mach32  and  the
       lack  of  a line doubling mode as VGA has. The Mach32 is not intended for
       such low resolutions. If you find a better mode or have an  idea,  please
       let me know. You can also just remove my timings from the default config&#8208;
       uration file.


7. THE CONFIGURATION EEPROM
       Ah yes, about the EEPROM, I figured out how to read out the  Mach32  EEP&#8208;
       ROM.  I did it by disassembling the BIOS routine mentioned in the docs. I
       then redid it in C. The driver will use everything it finds there.

       Use the Mach32 install tools (they should have reached you together  with
       your  Mach32  VGA  card) to setup your card/monitor combo correctly.  The
       monitors setting from the config file (or default of 35kHz or  something)
       will be obeyed by the driver nevertheless (for safety!).

       As  you  probably  know  already, accessing the EEPROM causes some screen
       flickering. If this annoys you (or even worse your monitor) have  a  look
       at  the  mach32eeprom command described below. This allows you to put the
       data from the EEPROM into a file and which can be  read  whenever  it  is
       required.

       Don&apos;t  even  think  about changing the contents of the file. (There is an
       easily faked checksum in it.). Anyway the driver ensures (hopefully) that
       no damage can be caused.

       Also,  if  some mode is not well aligned on your screen or you don&apos;t like
       it&apos;s sync frequency, consider using the Mach32 install utility (setup for
       custom monitor) and set one up interactively. If there is no valid faster
       (higher VSYNC) standard mode given in the EEPROM the driver will use that
       mode. You will find that this is fun compared with calculating video tim&#8208;
       ings for /etc/XF86Config or /etc/vga/libvga.config.

       However the install utility does restrict the  maximum  pixel  depth  for
       custom  modes  sometimes unneeded hard and the driver obeys that.  (Hmm..
       actually it should be smart enough to decide itself which pixel depth  it
       can  use  in  that  mode.)   Since  the  standard  modes are usually only
       slightly shifted to one side a file with the configuration commands  rep&#8208;
       resenting  the  standard modes is given in mach32/mach32.std-modes in the
       svgalib distribution. You can use these as a starting point.

       But here are some real problems:


8. EEPROM WOES
       I got 2 reports of people having problems with  incorrect  EEPROM  check&#8208;
       sums.   Both  had  motherboards  with  onboard  Mach32  VGA&apos;s from AST. I
       guessed a checksum algorithm from those reports and put this in the  code
       in  addition  to  the standard ATI style. Still I got a report of someone
       whose EEPROM was completely empty. If you have  problems  with  checksums
       send me the output of mach32info(6) and I&apos;ll see what I can do.

       By default svgalib writes a complaining message and ignores the contents.
       You can have svgalib ignore the checksum and contents with the configura&#8208;
       tion command

       mach32eeprom ignore

       Then you can decide to use the partial info that is still in it. Use

       mach32eeprom ignore usetimings

       to use the video modes that are defined in the EEPROM (if no better modes
       are known by the driver). This is usually safe, because the driver  knows
       which modes are safe for your hardware (if clocks, monitor and ramdac are
       configured correctly). You can also allow the driver to use the  configu&#8208;
       ration for the linear frame buffer in the EEPROM:

       mach32eeprom ignore useaperture

       or

       mach32eeprom ignore usetimings useaperture

       However  I  discourage  this because the driver will just enable what the
       EEPROM says about the aperture. Use mach32info(6) to check the address it
       will  choose  is  safe. It might be better to use setuplinear to set up a
       4MB aperture at a free address range.


9. THE MACH32EEPROM COMMAND
       The mach32eeprom allows to work around these problems. Here is  the  com&#8208;
       plete description for this configuration command.


       mach32eeprom filename
              The filename has to begin with a &quot;/&quot;.

              Unfortunately reading the EEPROM causes annoying screen flickering
              and is slow.  To avoid this, specify a filename from which to read
              the contents of the EEPROM.

              If the file cannot be read, the EEPROM is read out and the file is
              created. There is a very  simple  checksum  put  into  this  file.
              Although it can easily be fooled, don&apos;t change the file except you
              know very, very well what you are doing.

              Also, as long as the file exists, changes in the  Mach32&apos;s  EEPROM
              are  ignored.  Delete  the  file to recreate an updated version on
              next use of svgalib. You should ensure that the permissions of the
              file  don&apos;t  allow  normal users to change it. (This may happen if
              umask has a bad value when svgalib creates the file).

              Example:

              mach32eeprom /etc/vga/mach32.eeprom


       Due to problems with some boards this command got heavily expanded:


       mach32eeprom subcommand1 [subcommand2...]
              At least one subcommand is needed. Valid subcommands are:
&#12;
              ignore Don&apos;t complain about checksum and don&apos;t use any EEPROM con&#8208;
                     tents.

              useaperture
                     Use  the configuration for the memory aperture given in the
                     EEPROM.

              usetimings
                     Use video modes found in the EEPROM of the board.

              nofile Forget about any filename that maybe  was  already  config&#8208;
                     ured.  Don&apos;t read a file, don&apos;t create one.

              file filename
                     New  style form to specify the filename; On contrary to the
                     mach32eeprom filename form it can be mixed with  any  other
                     mach32eeprom subcommand.

              updatefile
                     Don&apos;t  read  the  file, always read the EEPROM (except when
                     ignore is given) and create an uptodate image of  the  EEP&#8208;
                     ROM.

              keepfile
                     Disable all previous updatefile commands.

              compatible
                     Fall  back  to  default behavior: If checksum on the EEPROM
                     data is not ok, use nothing of the configuration  data.  If
                     it is ok, configure everything as specified in the EEPROM.

              The subcommands are intended to be used together and are performed
              in the order specified. For example:

              mach32eeprom ignore useaperture usetimings

              will ignore the checksum of your EEPROM,  but  use  its  contents.
              Order is vital! So:

              mach32eeprom useaperture usetimings ignore

              won&apos;t  use any configuration from your EEPROM. Be careful with the
              useaperture subcommand. Please see the EEPROM WOES  section.  Note
              that any non understood subcommand will terminate the mach32eeprom
              command silently! Use only one subcommand per mach32eeprom command
              to avoid this.

              The mach32eeprom command is usually not allowed in the environment
              variable SVGALIB_CONFIG.


10. SETUP OF THE MEMORY APERTURE (LINEAR FRAMEBUFFER)
       Due to poor design, Xfree86 insists on setting up the aperture itself. It
       doesn&apos;t  reset  the  original  settings  at a VC switch once it runs. You
       should not start X for the first time after a boot as long as an  svgalib
       application  is  running. This will result in pre X values being restored
       at a VC switch by svgalib. If you use svgalib and  XF86_Mach32  together,
       run  X first or at least do not start it while any svgalib appl. is still
       running. After X was started once you can use svgalib and X in all combi&#8208;
       nations  w/o  any  problems.  Xfree uses whatever address is given in the
       MEM_CFG Mach32 register for a 4MB aperture, even if the aperture  is  not
       already enabled and the value in this register is pointless garbage. This
       is IMHO a dangerous bug as some systems may work only with  a  1MB  aper&#8208;
       ture.

       However,  usage of a correct EEPROM circumvents any such problems. If you
       cannot use that, use mach32info (6)  to  find  the  address  in  MEM_CFG.
       Then,  if it is a sensible setting for your system, enable a 4MB aperture
       at that address with setuplinear.  Ensure that no other  card  or  memory
       uses the address range you choose.


11. ACCELERATOR SUPPORT AND OTHER WEIRD FEATURES
       This  version  now  has support for all accelerator functions of svgalib.
       However they were intended for use with the cirrus chips. It  may  happen
       that  at  runtime  they  find  they  cannot emulate the function actually
       requested. Then you should disable the corresponding  blit  function  (at
       least for that application) with the blit config command.

       Data  transfer  between the host and the Mach32 is normally via I/O. This
       proved to be pretty slow. If a big enough aperture is available, a simple
       memory  copy is used instead. This is usually much faster. You can change
       which method is used with the blit command. This I/O option affects  only
       vga_imageblt(3).  The other functions are incredible fast.

       For  type  2  DACS,  there is support for 8 bit per color (instead of the
       normal 6) in the RGB triple in the color lookup table of  the  256  color
       modes. This can be enabled by an application, if it supports it. The tes&#8208;
       taccel(6) demo uses it if  supported  by  your  hardware.   You  can  use
       vga_ext_set(3) to use it from your programs.


12. RAMDACS
       Mach32  Ramdacs are specified by a type in range 1 .. 5. This type can be
       queried from the Mach32 and then specifies how to set up  the  ramdac.  A
       list  of  actual  hardware chips used for each type exists, but is not of
       much use. The Mach32 will return a type and the ramdac will be completely
       hardware compatible to one of the given type.

       Type  1  and 4 Dacs need different clock frequencies for high colormodes.
       For 32K/64K colormodes the frequencies have to be  doubled  and  for  16M
       colors  (type  4 only) they have to be tripled. I followed the ATI scheme
       and did this internally. However this means that for 32K/64K you can  use
       only clocks for which the doubled frequencies can be generated as well.

       This is no hard restriction as the 16 clocks of the Mach32 can be divided
       by 2.  Thus if you setup some mode yourself try to use one of the divided
       clocks in your timings and I can use the undivided clocks internally.

       It  is  a real restriction for 16M colors. ATI itself only supports 25MHz
       (640x480) here by use of a 75MHz clock.  Depending  on  your  clock  chip
       other  values may be usable as well. Even the doubled/tripled clocks have
       to be less than the magic 80  MHz.  However  the  driver  does  all  this
       itself.  It  may  just  happen that some of the predefined or one of your
       handmade mode-timings can&apos;t be used because the clock that is used cannot
       be  doubled/tripled.   Even though there is already some tolerance in the
       driver you may fix that by slightly changing the clock  values  that  you
       set  with  the clocks command. But note that this will as well affect the
       ability of the driver to calculate video timings and thus it  ability  to
       check the monitor and DAC safety restrictions.

       In  addition (in complete contrast to my original ATI docs) RAMDAC 4 does
       not support RGB with blue byte  first  but  only  with  red  first.  This
       required  special handling and me adding a bunch of functions to all mod&#8208;
       ules of svgalib and vgagl. The added functions are of  lower  performance
       than the usual functions. However most data has to be completely mangled,
       so I doubt that it can be done much faster. Sorry.

       Of course, I might have forgotten to port some  parts  or  even  confused
       things.  About  bugs  in  the  gl and drawing libs, please ask Harm.  But
       then, I&apos;m able to emulate a BGR ramdac on my card, so I  should  even  be
       able to reproduce your problems.
&#12;       Recently I hear often about type 6 ramdacs in non ATI Mach32 cards. There
       exists no info about these dacs, thus I cannot support them.  The  driver
       assumes  unknown  DACs  can stand up to 80MHz in 256 color clut modes and
       does not touch the ramdac (that is, assumes it is in the 256  color  mode
       already)

       To get rid of the warning message you can use the


       ramdac n
              configuration command. It allows to explicitly set the type of the
              dac to n (in range 0 to 5).  Ramdac 3 is the most  dumbest  ramdac
              possible, s.t. you can use it without any fear for your hardware.

       ramdac dumb
              is equivalent to ramdac 3.

       ramdac auto
              switches back to the default autodetection.

13. MEANING OF THE DETECTION MESSAGE FROM SVGALIB
       Some programs (which do not switch it off) will show a

       Using Mach32 version (sizeM at adrM (how), memK mem, DAC dactype)

       line.  This  will  show  up in testlinear(6) etc but will probably scroll
       away when you use vgatest(6).  In this line:


       version
              is the version of the driver (as of my counting, not  the  svgalib
              version).

       size   is  the size of the memory aperture. It can be 1 or 4 (1 will lead
              to not using the linear aperture if your card has  more  than  1MB
              memory,  however  applications  can still use the 1MB aperture and
              page the video memory through it in 1MB steps).  size can also  be
              no if no aperture is setup at all.

       adr    is the base address of the aperture in MB.

       how    is  autodetect if the aperture was setup this way already when the
              program started. It is setup when the  the  setting  was  enforced
              with  a  setuplinear  configuration  command. It is EEPROM when no
              aperture was detected, but parameters to set it up were  found  in
              the EEPROM.

       mem    is the amount of memory the card reported to have.

       dactype
              is the type of the DAC that was detected.

              If  a  special ramdac type was set with the ramdac command a (set)
              will be displayed after dactype.

       If mem, dactype and/or the chipset were enforced with  chipset  from  the
       configuration  file  or  vga_setchipsetandfeatures(3)  a  forced  will be
       appended to the line.


14. CONCLUSIONS
       A final word: I have an ATI ULTRA PRO/2MB/EISA with a  Type  2  DAC.   My
       monitor  is an EIZO F550i-M. Everything I tried works on it like a charm.
       However, I couldn&apos;t try it with other machines  myself  and  esp.   other
       DAC&apos;s.  Fortunately the Type 2 DAC is the worst to code. So I will proba&#8208;
       bly have gotten the other DAC&apos;s right. But please be warned!
&#12;       I did my very best to code the driver to support the other DAC&apos;s by  just
       reading  the  docs.   But i can&apos;t give any definitive guarantee for it to
       work or even not damaging your hardware. So please be careful!

       Note that you will have to set the environment variable SVGALIB_MACH32 to
       ILLTRYIT if your DAC is not type 0, 2, 3 or 4. This will of course change
       if no one with a DAC equal to 1 or 5 has serious problems. If you have  a
       different  DAC,  making  patches  to  support your card will be much more
       helpful instead of just complaining.  If you have a  different  DAC  that
       works  well  tell  me  as  well  such  that  I  can  remove  the need for
       SVGALIB_MACH32 in the next release. Still, even now, after years,  I  got
       no reports of a Mach32 card with a type 1 or 5 ramdac. Go figure.

       Thank you for your audience and wishes you will enjoy this driver,
       Michael.
