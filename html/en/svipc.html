SVIPC(7)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   SVIPC(7)



NAME
       svipc - System V interprocess communication mechanisms

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  refers  to  the  Linux implementation of the System V
       interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms:  message  queues,  semaphore
       sets,  and  shared  memory segments.  In the following, the word resource
       means an instantiation of one among such mechanisms.

   Resource Access Permissions
       For each resource, the system uses a  common  structure  of  type  struct
       ipc_perm  to  store information needed in determining permissions to per&#8208;
       form an IPC operation.  The ipc_perm  structure  includes  the  following
       members:

           struct ipc_perm {
               uid_t          cuid;   /* creator user ID */
               gid_t          cgid;   /* creator group ID */
               uid_t          uid;    /* owner user ID */
               gid_t          gid;    /* owner group ID */
               unsigned short mode;   /* r/w permissions */
           };

       The mode member of the ipc_perm structure defines, with its lower 9 bits,
       the access permissions to the resource for a  process  executing  an  IPC
       system call.  The permissions are interpreted as follows:

           0400    Read by user.
           0200    Write by user.
           0040    Read by group.
           0020    Write by group.
           0004    Read by others.
           0002    Write by others.

       Bits  0100,  0010,  and 0001 (the execute bits) are unused by the system.
       Furthermore, &quot;write&quot; effectively means &quot;alter&quot; for a semaphore set.

       The same system header file also  defines  the  following  symbolic  con&#8208;
       stants:

       IPC_CREAT     Create entry if key doesn&apos;t exist.

       IPC_EXCL      Fail if key exists.

       IPC_NOWAIT    Error if request must wait.

       IPC_PRIVATE   Private key.

       IPC_RMID      Remove resource.

       IPC_SET       Set resource options.

       IPC_STAT      Get resource options.

       Note  that IPC_PRIVATE is a key_t type, while all the other symbolic con&#8208;
       stants are flag fields and can be OR&apos;ed into an int type variable.
&#12;   Message Queues
       A message queue is uniquely identified by a positive integer (its  msqid)
       and  has an associated data structure of type struct msqid_ds, defined in
       &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;, containing the following members:

           struct msqid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm msg_perm;
               msgqnum_t       msg_qnum;    /* no of messages on queue */
               msglen_t        msg_qbytes;  /* bytes max on a queue */
               pid_t           msg_lspid;   /* PID of last msgsnd(2) call */
               pid_t           msg_lrpid;   /* PID of last msgrcv(2) call */
               time_t          msg_stime;   /* last msgsnd(2) time */
               time_t          msg_rtime;   /* last msgrcv(2) time */
               time_t          msg_ctime;   /* last change time */
           };

       msg_perm   ipc_perm structure that specifies the  access  permissions  on
                  the message queue.

       msg_qnum   Number of messages currently on the message queue.

       msg_qbytes Maximum number of bytes of message text allowed on the message
                  queue.

       msg_lspid  ID of the process that performed  the  last  msgsnd(2)  system
                  call.

       msg_lrpid  ID  of  the  process  that performed the last msgrcv(2) system
                  call.

       msg_stime  Time of the last msgsnd(2) system call.

       msg_rtime  Time of the last msgrcv(2) system call.

       msg_ctime  Time of the last system call that  changed  a  member  of  the
                  msqid_ds structure.

   Semaphore Sets
       A  semaphore set is uniquely identified by a positive integer (its semid)
       and has an associated data structure of type struct semid_ds, defined  in
       &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;, containing the following members:

           struct semid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm sem_perm;
               time_t          sem_otime;   /* last operation time */
               time_t          sem_ctime;   /* last change time */
               unsigned long   sem_nsems;   /* count of sems in set */
           };

       sem_perm   ipc_perm  structure  that  specifies the access permissions on
                  the semaphore set.

       sem_otime  Time of last semop(2) system call.

       sem_ctime  Time of last semctl(2) system call that changed  a  member  of
                  the above structure or of one semaphore belonging to the set.

       sem_nsems  Number of semaphores in the set.  Each semaphore of the set is
                  referenced  by  a  nonnegative  integer  ranging  from  0   to
                  sem_nsems-1.

       A semaphore is a data structure of type struct sem containing the follow&#8208;
       ing members:

           struct sem {
               int semval;  /* semaphore value */
               int sempid;  /* PID for last operation */
           };

       semval     Semaphore value: a nonnegative integer.

       sempid     ID of the last process that performed a semaphore operation on
                  this semaphore.

   Shared Memory Segments
       A shared memory segment is uniquely identified by a positive integer (its
       shmid) and has an associated data  structure  of  type  struct  shmid_ds,
       defined in &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;, containing the following members:

           struct shmid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm shm_perm;
               size_t          shm_segsz;   /* size of segment */
               pid_t           shm_cpid;    /* PID of creator */
               pid_t           shm_lpid;    /* PID, last operation */
               shmatt_t        shm_nattch;  /* no. of current attaches */
               time_t          shm_atime;   /* time of last attach */
               time_t          shm_dtime;   /* time of last detach */
               time_t          shm_ctime;   /* time of last change */
           };

       shm_perm   ipc_perm  structure  that  specifies the access permissions on
                  the shared memory segment.

                  ment.
