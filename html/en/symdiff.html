NAME
       symdiff - Symbolic differentiation for Tcl

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.5

       package require grammar::aycock  1.0

       package require math::calculus::symdiff  1.0

       math::calculus::symdiff::symdiff expression variable

       math::calculus::jacobian variableDict

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  math::calculus::symdiff  package provides a symbolic differentiation
       facility for Tcl math expressions. It is useful for providing derivatives
       to  packages  that  either  require the Jacobian of a set of functions or
       else are more efficient or stable when the Jacobian is provided.

PROCEDURES
       The math::calculus::symdiff package exports the two procedures:

       math::calculus::symdiff::symdiff expression variable
              Differentiates the given expression with respect to the  specified
              variable. (See Expressions below for a discussion of the subset of
              Tcl math expressions that are acceptable to  math::calculus::symd&#8208;
              iff.)   The  result is a Tcl expression that evaluates the deriva&#8208;
              tive. Returns an error if expression is not a well-formed  expres&#8208;
              sion or is not differentiable.

       math::calculus::jacobian variableDict
              Computes  the  Jacobian  of  a system of equations.  The system is
              given by the dictionary variableDict, whose keys are the names  of
              variables in the system, and whose values are Tcl expressions giv&#8208;
              ing the values of those variables. (See Expressions  below  for  a
              discussion  of the subset of Tcl math expressions that are accept&#8208;
              able to math::calculus::symdiff. The result is a  list  of  lists:
              the  i&apos;th element of the j&apos;th sublist is the partial derivative of
              the i&apos;th variable with respect to the j&apos;th  variable.  Returns  an
              error  if  any  of the expressions cannot be differentiated, or if
              variableDict is not a well-formed dictionary.

EXPRESSIONS
       The math::calculus::symdiff package accepts only a small  subset  of  the
       expressions  that  are  acceptable  to  Tcl  commands such as expr or if.
       Specifically, the only constructs accepted are:

       &#183;      Floating-point constants such as 5 or 3.14159e+00.

       &#183;      References to Tcl  variable  using  $-substitution.  The  variable
              names  must  consist  of alphanumerics and underscores: the ${...}
              notation is not accepted.

       &#183;      Parentheses.

       &#183;      The +, -, *, /. and ** operators.
&#12;       &#183;      Calls to the functions acos, asin, atan, atan2,  cos,  cosh,  exp,
              hypot, log, log10, pow, sin, sinh. sqrt, tan, and tanh.

       Command  substitution, backslash substitution, and argument expansion are
       not accepted.

EXAMPLES
              math::calculus::symdiff::symdiff {($a*$x+$b)*($c*$x+$d)} x
              ==&gt; (($c * (($a * $x) + $b)) + ($a * (($c * $x) + $d)))
              math::calculus::symdiff::jacobian {x {$a * $x + $b * $y}
                                       y {$c * $x + $d * $y}}
              ==&gt; {{$a} {$b}} {{$c} {$d}}
