AUTHORS
       Synaptic was originally developed by  Alfredo  K.  Kojima  &lt;kojima@conec&#8208;
       tiva.com.br&gt;.   His   last   official  release  was  0.16.  Michael  Vogt
       &lt;mvo@debian.org&gt; took over his  CVS  version,  that  already  included  a
       nearly  complete  port  to Gtk+. Michael completed the port and added new
       features. See the NEWS file for the user visible changes from that  point
       on.  Conectiva  is still involved in the development of synaptic. Gustavo
       Niemeyer &lt;niemeyer@conectiva.com&gt; is doing a great deal of work.

       All development is done at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/synaptic
