SYNC(2)                     Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                    SYNC(2)



NAME
       sync, syncfs - commit buffer cache to disk

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       void sync(void);

       int syncfs(int fd);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sync():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

       syncfs():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sync() causes all buffered modifications to file metadata and data to  be
       written to the underlying file systems.

       syncfs() is like sync(), but synchronizes just the file system containing
       file referred to by the open file descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUE
       syncfs() returns 0 on success; on error, it returns -1 and sets errno  to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       sync() is always successful.

       syncfs() can fail for at least the following reason:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

VERSIONS
       syncfs()  first  appeared  in  Linux 2.6.39; library support was added to
       glibc in version 2.14.

CONFORMING TO
       sync(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

       syncfs() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Since glibc 2.2.2 the Linux prototype for sync() is as listed above, fol&#8208;
       lowing  the various standards.  In libc4, libc5, and glibc up to 2.2.1 it
       was &quot;int sync(void)&quot;, and sync() always returned 0.

BUGS
       According to the  standard  specification  (e.g.,  POSIX.1-2001),  sync()
       schedules  the  writes, but may return before the actual writing is done.
       However, since version 1.3.20 Linux does actually wait.  (This still does
       not guarantee data integrity: modern disks have large caches.)
