synclient(1)                                                        synclient(1)



NAME
       synclient  -  commandline  utility  to  query and modify Synaptics driver
       options.

SYNOPSIS
       synclient [-m interval]
       synclient [-hlV?] [var1=value1 [var2=value2] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  lets  you  change  your  Synaptics  TouchPad  driver   for
       XOrg/XFree86 server parameters while X is running.

       For the -m and -h options, SHM must be enabled by setting the option SHM&#8208;
       Config &quot;on&quot; in your XOrg/XFree86 configuration.

OPTIONS
       -m interval
              monitor changes to the touchpad  state.   Interval  specifies  how
              often  (in  ms)  to poll the touchpad state.  Whenever a change in
              the touchpad state is detected, one line of  output  is  generated
              that  describes the current state of the touchpad.  This option is
              only available in SHM mode.  The following data is included in the
              output.

              time   Time in seconds since the logging was started.

              x,y    The  x/y  coordinates  of  the finger on the touchpad.  The
                     origin is in the upper left corner.

              z      The &quot;pressure&quot; value.  Pressing the finger  harder  on  the
                     touchpad typically produces a larger value.  Note that most
                     touchpads don&apos;t measure the real pressure though.  Instead,
                     capacitance is usually measured, which is correlated to the
                     contact area between the finger and  the  touchpad.   Since
                     more  pressure  usually  means  a  larger contact area, the
                     reported pressure value is at least indirectly  related  to
                     the real pressure.

              f      The  number  of  fingers  currently  touching the touchpad.
                     Note that only some touchpads can report more than one fin&#8208;
                     ger.   Generally,  synaptics touchpads can, but ALPS touch&#8208;
                     pads can&apos;t.

              w      The w value is a measurement of the finger width.  This  is
                     only supported by some synaptics touchpads.  Touchpads that
                     can&apos;t measure the finger width  typically  report  a  faked
                     constant value when a finger is touching the touchpad.

              l,r,u,d,m,multi
                     The  state  of  the left, right, up, down, middle and multi
                     buttons.  Zero means not pressed, one means  pressed.   Not
                     all  touchpads have all these buttons.  If a button doesn&apos;t
                     exist, the value is always reported as 0.

       -l     List current user settings. This is the default if  no  option  is
              given.

       -V     Print version number and exit.

       -?     Show the help message.

       var=value
              Set user parameter var to value.

FILES
       /etc/X11/xorg.conf

       /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

EXAMPLES
       To disable EdgeMotionSpeed:

       synclient EdgeMotionSpeed=0

       To monitor touchpad events (requires SHM):

       synclient -m 100
