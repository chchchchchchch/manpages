syndaemon(1)                                                        syndaemon(1)



NAME
       syndaemon  -  a  program that monitors keyboard activity and disables the
       touchpad when the keyboard is being used.

SYNOPSIS
       syndaemon [-i idle-time] [-m poll-inverval] [-d] [-p pid-file] [-t]  [-k]
       [-K] [-R]

DESCRIPTION
       Disabling  the  touchpad  while  typing  avoids unwanted movements of the
       pointer that could lead to giving focus to the wrong window.

OPTIONS
       -i &lt;idle-time&gt;
              How many seconds to wait after the last key press before  enabling
              the touchpad.  (default is 2.0s).

       -m &lt;poll-interval&gt;
              How  many  milliseconds  to wait between two polling intervals. If
              this value is too low, it will cause unnecessary wake-ups. If this
              value  is  too  high,  some  key presses (press and release happen
              between two intervals) may not be  noticed.  This  switch  has  no
              effect when running with -R.  Default is 200ms.

       -d     Start as a daemon, ie in the background.

       -p &lt;pid-file&gt;
              Create  a  pid  file with the specified filename.  A pid file will
              only be created if the program is started in daemon mode.

       -t     Only disable  tapping  and  scrolling,  not  mouse  movements,  in
              response to keyboard activity.

       -k     Ignore modifier keys when monitoring keyboard activity.

       -K     Like -k but also ignore Modifier+Key combos.

       -R     Use  the XRecord extension for detecting keyboard activity instead
              of polling the keyboard state.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY
              Specifies the X server to contact.

EXIT CODES
       If syndaemon exists with a return code other than 0,  the  error  encoun&#8208;
       tered is as below.

       Exit code 1
              Invalid commandline argument.

       Exit code 2
              The  connection  to  the  X  sever  could not be established or no
              touchpad device could be found.

       Exit code 3
              The fork into daemon mode failed or the pid file could not be cre&#8208;
              ated.

       Exit code 4
              XRECORD requested but not available or usable on the server.
&#12;CAVEATS
       It  doesn&apos;t  make much sense to connect to a remote X server, because the
       daemon will then monitor the remote server  for  keyboard  activity,  but
       will disable the touchpad on the local machine.
