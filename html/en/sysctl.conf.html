SYSCTL.CONF(5)                    File Formats                    SYSCTL.CONF(5)



NAME
       sysctl.conf - sysctl preload/configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       sysctl.conf  is  a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in and
       set by sysctl.  The syntax is simply as follows:

              # comment
              ; comment

              token = value

       Note that blank lines are ignored, and  whitespace  before  and  after  a
       token  or  value  is  ignored,  although  a  value can contain whitespace
       within.  Lines which begin with a # or  ;  are  considered  comments  and
       ignored.

EXAMPLE
              # sysctl.conf sample
              #
                kernel.domainname = example.com
              ; this one has a space which will be written to the sysctl!
                kernel.modprobe = /sbin/mod probe

FILES
       /run/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /etc/sysctl.conf
              The  paths  where  sysctl  preload  files  usually exit.  See also
              sysctl option --system.
