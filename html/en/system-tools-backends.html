NAME
       system-tools-backends - message dispatcher for system-tools-backends

SYNOPSIS
       system-tools-backends

DESCRIPTION
       System  Tools  Backends are a set of cross-platform modules for Linux and
       other Unix systems. The backends provide an common DBus interface to  all
       platforms to modify or read the system configuration in a distro indepen&#8208;
       dent fashion.

       This program is a lightweight DBus message dispatcher. It does  not  take
       any options.
