SYSV_SIGNAL(3)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             SYSV_SIGNAL(3)



NAME
       sysv_signal - signal handling with System V semantics

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

       sighandler_t sysv_signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

DESCRIPTION
       The  sysv_signal()  function  takes  the same arguments, and performs the
       same task, as signal(2).

       However sysv_signal() provides the System V unreliable signal  semantics,
       that  is:  a)  the disposition of the signal is reset to the default when
       the handler is invoked; b) delivery of further instances of the signal is
       not  blocked while the signal handler is executing; and c) if the handler
       interrupts (certain) blocking system calls, then the system call  is  not
       automatically restarted.

RETURN VALUE
       The  sysv_signal() function returns the previous value of the signal han&#8208;
       dler, or SIG_ERR on error.

ERRORS
       As for signal(2).

CONFORMING TO
       This function is nonstandard.

NOTES
       Use of sysv_signal() should be avoided; use sigaction(2) instead.

       On older Linux systems, sysv_signal() and signal(2) were equivalent.  But
       on  newer systems, signal(2) provides reliable signal semantics; see sig&#8208;
       nal(2) for details.

       The use of sighandler_t is a GNU extension; this type is only defined  if
       the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined.
