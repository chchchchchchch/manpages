tabs(1)                                                                  tabs(1)



NAME
       tabs - set tabs on a terminal

SYNOPSIS
       tabs [-v[n]] [-ahuUV] file...

DESCRIPTION
       The  tabs  program  clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.  This uses
       the terminfo clear_all_tabs  and  set_tab  capabilities.   If  either  is
       absent,  tabs  is  unable to clear/set tab-stops.  The terminal should be
       configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,

              stty tab0

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -Tname
            Tell tabs which terminal type to use.  If this option is not  given,
            tabs  will  use the $TERM environment variable.  If that is not set,
            it will use the ansi+tabs entry.

       -d   The debugging option shows a ruler line, followed by two data lines.
            The  first data line shows the expected tab-stops marked with aster&#8208;
            isks.  The second data line shows the actual tab-stops, marked  with
            asterisks.

       -n   This  option  tells  tabs to check the options and run any debugging
            option, but not to modify the terminal settings.

       The tabs program processes a single list of tab stops.  The  last  option
       to  be processed which defines a list is the one that determines the list
       to be processed.

   Implicit Lists
       Use a single number as an option, e.g., &quot;-5&quot; to set  tabs  at  the  given
       interval  (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).  Tabs are repeated up to
       the right margin of the screen.

       Use &quot;-0&quot; to clear all tabs.

       Use &quot;-8&quot; to set tabs to the standard interval.

   Explicit Lists
       An explicit list can be defined after the options (this does  not  use  a
       &quot;-&quot;).   The  values  in the list must be in increasing numeric order, and
       greater than zero.  They are separated by a comma or a blank,  for  exam&#8208;
       ple,

              tabs 1,6,11,16,21
              tabs 1 6 11 16 21
       Use  a  &apos;+&apos;  to  treat  a number as an increment relative to the previous
       value, e.g.,

              tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5
       which is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.

   Predefined Tab-Stops
       X/Open defines several predefined lists of tab stops.

       -a   Assembler, IBM S/370, first format

       -a2  Assembler, IBM S/370, second format
&#12;       -c   COBOL, normal format

       -c2  COBOL compact format

       -c3  COBOL compact format extended

       -f   FORTRAN

       -p   PL/I

       -s   SNOBOL

       -u   UNIVAC 1100 Assembler

PORTABILITY
       X/Open describes a +m option, to set a terminal&apos;s left-margin.  Very  few
       of the entries in the terminal database provide this capability.

       The  -d  (debug)  and  -n  (no-op) options are extensions not provided by
       other implementations.

       Documentation for other implementations states that there is a  limit  on
       the  number  of  tab stops.  While some terminals may not accept an arbi&#8208;
       trary number of tab stops, this implementation will attempt  to  set  tab
       stops  up to the right margin of the screen, if the given list happens to
       be that long.
