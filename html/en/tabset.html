NAME
       tabset - Create and manipulate tabset widgets
_________________________________________________________________

SYNOPSIS
       tabset pathName ?options?

DESCRIPTION
       The tabset widget displays a series of overlapping folders. Only the con&#8208;
       tents of one folder at a time is displayed.  By clicking on the tab&apos;s  of
       a  folder,  you  can  view other folders.  Each folder may contain any Tk
       widget that can be automatically positioned and resized in the folder.

       There&apos;s no limit to the  number  of  folders.   Tabs  can  be  tiered  or
       scrolled.  Pages (i.e. embedded widgets) can be torn off and displayed in
       another toplevel widget, and also restored.  A tabset can also be used as
       just  a set of tabs, without a displaying any pages.  You can bind events
       to individual tabs, so it&apos;s easy to add features like &quot;balloon help&quot;.

INTRODUCTION
       Notebooks are a popular graphical paradigm.  They allow you  to  organize
       several  windows that are too big to display at the same time as pages of
       a notebook.  For example, your application may display several X-Y graphs
       at  the  same  time.  The graphs are too big to pack into the same frame.
       Managing them in several toplevel widgets is also cumbersome and clutters
       the  screen.   Instead, the tabset widget organizes the graphs as folders
       in a notebook.

       Only one page is visible at a time. When you click on a tab,  the  folder
       corresponding  to the tab is displayed in the  tabset widget.  The tabset
       also lets you temporarily tear pages out of the notebook into a  separate
       toplevel widget, and put them back in the tabset later.  For example, you
       could compare two graphs side-by-side  by  tearing  them  out,  and  then
       replace them when you are finished.

       A  tabset  can contain any number of folders.  If there are too many tabs
       to view, you can arrange them as multiple tiers or scroll the  tabs.  You
       can also attach Tk scrollbars to the tabset to scroll the tabs.

SYNTAX
       The  tabset  command creates a new window using the pathName argument and
       makes it into a tabset widget.  tabset pathName ?option value?...   Addi&#8208;
       tional  options  may  be  specified  on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the tabset such  as  its  colors,  font,
       text,  and relief.  The tabset command returns its pathName argument.  At
       the time this command is invoked, there must not  exist  a  window  named
       pathName, but pathName&apos;s parent must exist.

       When  first  created,  a  new tabset contains no tabs.  Tabs are added or
       deleted using widget operations described below. It is not necessary  for
       all  the  tabs  to  be  displayed  in the tabset window at once; commands
       described below may be used to change the view in  the  window.   Tabsets
       allow  scrolling of tabs using the -scrollcommand option.  They also sup&#8208;
       port scanning (see the scan operation).  Tabs may be arranged  along  any
       side of the tabset window using the -side option.

       The  size  of the tabset window is determined the number of tiers of tabs
       and the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder.  The  widest
       widget  determines  the  width  of the folder. The tallest determines the
       height.  If no folders contain an embedded widget, the size is determined
       solely by the size of the tabs.

       You  can  override  either dimension with the tabset&apos;s -width and -height
       options.

INDICES
       Indices refer to individual tabs/folders in  the  tabset.   Many  of  the
       operations  for tabset widgets take one or more indices as arguments.  An
       index may take several forms:

       number      Unique node id of the tab.

       @x,y        Tab that covers the point in the tabset window specified by x
                   and  y (in screen coordinates).  If no tab covers that point,
                   then the index is ignored.

       select      The currently selected tab.  The select  index  is  typically
                   changed  by  either  clicking  on the tab with the left mouse
                   button or using the widget&apos;s invoke operation.

       active      The tab where the mouse pointer is  currently  located.   The
                   label  is drawn using its active colors (see the -activeback&#8208;
                   ground and -activeforeground options).  The active  index  is
                   typically  changed  by moving the mouse pointer over a tab or
                   using the widget&apos;s activate operation. There can be only  one
                   active  tab  at a time.  If there is no tab located under the
                   mouse pointer, the index is ignored.

       focus       Tab that currently has the widget&apos;s focus.  This tab is  dis&#8208;
                   played  with  a dashed line around its label.  You can change
                   this using the focus operation. If no tab has focus, then the
                   index is ignored.

       down        Tab  immediately  below  the tab that currently has focus, if
                   there is one. If there is no tab below, the  current  tab  is
                   returned.

       left        Tab immediately to the left the tab that currently has focus,
                   if there is one.  If there is no tab to the left, the current
                   tab is returned.

       right       Tab  immediately  to  the  right  the  tab that currently has
                   focus, if there is one. If there is no tab to the right,  the
                   current tab is returned.

       up          Tab  immediately above, if there is one, to the tab that cur&#8208;
                   rently has focus. If there is no tab above, the  current  tab
                   is returned.

       end         Last  tab  in the tabset.  If there are no tabs in the tabset
                   then the index is ignored.

       Some indices may not always be available.  For example, if the  mouse  is
       not over any tab, &quot;active&quot; does not have an index.  For most tabset oper&#8208;
       ations this is harmless and ignored.

OPERATIONS
       All tabset operations are invoked by specifying  the  widget&apos;s  pathname,
       the  operation,  and  any  arguments that pertain to that operation.  The
       general form is:

            pathName operation ?arg arg ...?

       Operation and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.   The
       following operations are available for tabset widgets:
&#12;       pathName activate index
              Sets the active tab to the one indicated by index.  The active tab
              is drawn with its active colors  (see  the  -activebackground  and
              -activeforeground  options)  and  may  be retrieved with the index
              active.  Only one tab may be active at a time.  If  index  is  the
              empty  string, then all tabs will be drawn with their normal fore&#8208;
              ground and background colors.

       pathName bind tagName ?sequence? ?command?
              Associates command with  tagName  such  that  whenever  the  event
              sequence given by sequence occurs for a tab with this tag, command
              will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the bind command except
              that it operates on tabs, rather than widgets. See the bind manual
              entry for complete details on sequence and the substitutions  per&#8208;
              formed on command.

              If  all  arguments  are  specified  then a new binding is created,
              replacing any existing binding for the same sequence and  tagName.
              If  the  first  character of command is + then command augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no command argument
              is provided then the command currently associated with tagName and
              sequence (it&apos;s an error occurs if  there&apos;s  no  such  binding)  is
              returned.  If both command and sequence are missing then a list of
              all the event sequences for which bindings have been  defined  for
              tagName.

       pathName cget option
              Returns  the  current  value  of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the config&#8208;
              ure operation described in the section WIDGET OPTIONS below.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all  the  available
              options  for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified with no value,  then
              the  command  returns a list describing the one named option (this
              list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of  the  value
              returned  if no option is specified).  If one or more option-value
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies  the  given  widget
              option(s)  to  have  the given value(s);  in this case the command
              returns an empty string.  Option and value are  described  in  the
              section WIDGET OPTIONS below.

       pathName delete first ?last?
              Deletes  one or more tabs from the tabset.  First and last are the
              first and last indices, defining a range of tabs  to  be  deleted.
              If last isn&apos;t specified, then only the tab at first is deleted.

       pathName focus index
              Designates a tab to get the widget&apos;s focus.  This tab is displayed
              with a dashed line around its label.

       pathName get index
              Returns the name of the tab.  The value of index  may  be  in  any
              form described in the section INDICES .

       pathName index ?flag? string
              Returns  the  node  id of the tab specified by string.  If flag is
              -name, then string is the name of  a  tab.   If  flag  is  -index,
              string  is  an  index  such as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;focus&quot;.  If flag isn&apos;t
              specified, it defaults to -index.

       pathName insert position name ?option value?...
              Inserts new tabs into the tabset.  Tabs are inserted  just  before
              the tab given by position.  Position may be either a number, indi&#8208;
              cating where in the list the new tab  should  be  added,  or  end,
              indicating  that  the  new tab is to be added the end of the list.
              Name is the symbolic name of the tab. Be careful not to use a num&#8208;
              ber.  Otherwise  the  tabset  will  confuse  it  with tab indices.
              Returns a list of indices for all the new tabs.

       pathName invoke index
              Selects the tab given by index, maps the  tab&apos;s  embedded  widget,
              and invokes the Tcl command associated with the tab, if  there  is
              one.  The return value is the return value from the  Tcl  command,
              or an empty string  if there  is  no  command  associated with the
              tab.  This command is ignored if the  tab&apos;s state (see the  -state
              option) is disabled.

       pathName move index before|after index
              Moves the tab index to a new position in the tabset.

       pathName nearest x y
              Returns  the  name  of the tab nearest to given X-Y screen coordi&#8208;
              nate.

       pathName perforation operation ?args?
              This operation controls the perforation on the tab label.

              pathName perforation highlight index boolean

              pathName perforation invoke index
                     Invokes the command specified  for  perforations  (see  the
                     -perforationcommand  widget option). Typically this command
                     places the page into a top level widget. The  name  of  the
                     toplevel  is  the  concatonation of the pathName, &quot;-&quot;,  and
                     the tabName.  The return value is the return value from the
                     Tcl  command, or an empty string  if there  is  no  command
                     associated with the tab.  This command is  ignored  if  the
                     tab&apos;s state (see the -state option) is disabled.

       pathName scan option args
              This  command  implements  scanning on tabsets.  It has two forms,
              depending on option:

              pathName scan mark x y
                     Records x and y and the current view in the tabset  window;
                     used  with later scan dragto commands.  Typically this com&#8208;
                     mand is associated with a mouse button press in the widget.
                     It returns an empty string.

              pathName scan dragto x y.
                     This  command  computes  the difference between its x and y
                     arguments and the x and y arguments to the last  scan  mark
                     command  for  the  widget.   It then adjusts the view by 10
                     times the difference in coordinates.  This command is typi&#8208;
                     cally associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to
                     produce the effect of  dragging  the  list  at  high  speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       pathName see index
              Scrolls  the  tabset  so that the tab index is visible in the wid&#8208;
              get&apos;s window.

       pathName size
              Returns the number of tabs in the tabset.

       pathName tab operation ?args?

              pathName tab cget nameOrIndex option
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given
                     by  option.   Option may have any of the values accepted by
                     the tab configure operation described in  the  section  TAB
                     OPTIONS below.

              pathName tab configure nameOrIndex ?nameOrIndex...? option? ?value
              option value ...?
                     Query or modify the configuration options of  one  or  more
                     tabs.   If no option is specified, this operation returns a
                     list describing all the available options for  nameOrIndex.
                     NameOrIndex  can  be either the name of a tab or its index.
                     Names of tabs take precedence  over  their  indices.   That
                     means a tab named focus is picked over the &quot;focus&quot; tab.

                     If option is specified, but not value, then a list describ&#8208;
                     ing the one named option is  returned.   If   one  or  more
                     option-value  pairs  are  specified,  then  each  named tab
                     (specified by nameOrIndex)  will  have  its  configurations
                     option(s)  set  the given value(s).  In this last case, the
                     empty string is returned.  Option and value  are  described
                     in the section TAB OPTIONS below.

              pathName tab names ?pattern?
                     Returns  the  names of all the tabs matching the given pat&#8208;
                     tern. If no pattern argument  is  provided,  then  all  tab
                     names are returned.

              pathName tab tearoff index ?newName?
                     Reparents the widget embedded into index, placing it inside
                     of newName.  NewName is either the name of  an  new  widget
                     that  will  contain  the embedded widget or the name of the
                     tabset widget.  It the last case, the  embedded  widget  is
                     put back into the folder.

                     If  no  newName  argument is provided, then the name of the
                     current parent of the embedded widget is returned.

       pathName view args
              This command queries or changes the position of the tabset in  the
              widget&apos;s window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              pathName view
                     Returns  a  list  of  two  numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that
                     describe the amount and position of the tabset that is vis&#8208;
                     ible in the window.  For example, if view is &quot;0.2 0.6&quot;, 20%
                     of the tabset&apos;s text is off-screen to the left, 40% is vis&#8208;
                     ible  in the window, and 40% of the tabset is off-screen to
                     the right.  These are the same values passed to  scrollbars
                     via the -scrollcommand option.

              pathName view moveto fraction
                     Adjusts  the  view  in  the  window so that fraction of the
                     total width of the tabset text is off-screen to  the  left.
                     fraction must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.

              pathName view scroll number what
                     This  command  shifts  the  view in the window (left/top or
                     right/bottom) according to number and what.  Number must be
                     an integer. What must be either units or pages or an abbre&#8208;
                     viation of these.  If what is units, the view adjusts  left
                     or  right  by number scroll units (see the -scrollincrement
                     option).  ; if it is pages then the view adjusts by  number
                     widget windows.  If number is negative then tabs farther to
                     the left become visible; if it is positive then  tabs  far&#8208;
                     ther to the right become visible.

WIDGET OPTIONS
       Widget configuration options may be set either by the configure operation
       or the Tk option command.  The resource class is  Tabset.   The  resource
       name is the name of the widget.

              option add *Tabset.Foreground white
              option add *Tabset.Background blue

       The following widget options are available:

       -activebackground color
              Sets  the  default  active  background  color  for tabs.  A tab is
              active when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the activate
              operation.   Individual  tabs  may override this option by setting
              the tab&apos;s -activebackground option.

       -activeforeground color
              Sets the default active foreground  color  for  tabs.   A  tab  is
              active when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the activate
              operation.  Individual tabs may override this  option  by  setting
              the tab&apos;s -activeforeground option.

       -background color
              Sets the background color of the tabset.

       -borderwidth pixels
              Sets  the  width  of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the
              widget.  The -relief option determines how the  border  is  to  be

              tabs and their pages.  The default is 0.

       -highlightbackground  color
              Sets the color to display in the traversal highlight  region  when
              the tabset does not have the input focus.

       -highlightcolor color
              Sets  the  color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that
              is drawn around the widget when  it  has  the  input  focus.   The
              default is black.

       -highlightthickness pixels
              Sets  the width of the highlight rectangle to draw around the out&#8208;
              side of the widget when it has the input focus. Pixels is  a  non-
              negative value and may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_Get&#8208;
              Pixels.  If the value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn  around
              the widget.  The default is 2.

       -outerpad pixels
              Padding around the exterior of the tabset and folder.

       -pageheight pixels

              0.

       -perforationcommand string
              Specifies  a Tcl script to be invoked to tear off the current page
              in the tabset. This command is typically invoked when  left  mouse
              button  is  released over the tab perforation.  The default action
              is to tear-off the page and place it into a new toplevel window.

       -relief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect for the tabset widget.  Relief  specifies
              how  the tabset should appear relative to widget that it is packed
              into; for example, raised means the tabset should appear  to  pro&#8208;
              trude.  The default is sunken.

       -rotate theta
              Specifies  the  degrees  to rotate text in tab labels.  Theta is a
              real value representing the number of degrees to rotate  the  tick
              labels.  The default is 0.0 degrees.

       -samewidth boolean
              Indicates if each tab should be the same width.  If true, each tab

       -scrollcommand string
              Specifies the prefix for a command for communicating with  scroll&#8208;
              bars.   Whenever the view in the widget&apos;s window changes, the wid&#8208;
              get will generate a Tcl command by concatenating the  scroll  com&#8208;
              mand  and  two  numbers.  If this option is not specified, then no
              command will be executed.

       -scrollincrement pixels
              Sets the smallest number of pixels to scroll the tabs.  If  pixels
              is  greater than 0, this sets the units for scrolling (e.g.,  when
              you the change the view by clicking on the left and  right  arrows
              of a scrollbar).

       -selectbackground color
              Sets  the  color to use when displaying background of the selected
              tab. Individual tabs can override this option by setting the tab&apos;s
              -selectbackground option.

       -selectcommand string
              Specifies  a  default Tcl script to be associated with tabs.  This
              command is typically invoked when left mouse  button  is  released

       -slant slant
              Specifies if the tabs should be slanted 45  degrees  on  the  left
              and/or  right sides. The following values are valid for slant. The
              default is none.

              none      Tabs are drawn as a rectangle.

              left      The left side of the tab is slanted.

              right     The right side of the tab is slanted.

              both      Boths sides of the tab are slanted.

       -tabbackground color
              Sets the default background color of tabs.   Individual  tabs  can
              override this option by setting the tab&apos;s -background option.

       -tabborderwidth pixels
              Sets  the  width  of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the
              tab.  The -tabrelief option determines how the  border  is  to  be
              drawn.  The default is 2.

       -tabforeground color
              Specifies  the  color to use when displaying a tab&apos;s label.  Indi&#8208;
              vidual tabs can override this option by setting the  tab&apos;s  -fore&#8208;
              ground option.

       -tabrelief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect for both tabs and folders.  Relief speci&#8208;
              fies how the tabs should appear relative to background of the wid&#8208;
              get;  for example, raised means the tab should appear to protrude.
              The default is raised.

       -takefocus focus
              Provides information used when moving the  focus  from  window  to
              window via keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If focus
              is 0, this means that this window should be skipped entirely  dur&#8208;
              ing  keyboard  traversal.   1  means  that  the this window should
              always receive the input focus.  An empty  value  means  that  the
              traversal  scripts  decide  whether  to  focus on the window.  The
              default is 1.

       -tearoff boolean

       -textside side
              If both images and text are  specified  for  a  tab,  this  option
              determines  on  which side of the tab the text is to be displayed.
              The valid sides are left, right, top,  and  bottom.   The  default
              value is left.

       -tiers number

              The default value is 1.

       -tile image
              Specifies a tiled background for the widget.  If image  isn&apos;t  &quot;&quot;,
              the  background is tiled using image.  Otherwise, the normal back&#8208;
              ground color is drawn (see the -background option).  Image must be
              an image created using the Tk image command.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -width pixels
              Specifies the requested width of the widget.  If pixels is 0, then
              the width of the widget will be calculated based on the  size  the
              tabs and their pages.  The default is 0.

TAB OPTIONS
       In  addition to the configure operation, widget configuration options may
       also be set by the Tk option command.  The class resource name is Tab.

              option add *Tabset.Tab.Foreground white
              option add *Tabset.name.Background blue

       The following widget options are available:

       -activebackground color
              Sets the active background color for nameOrIndex.  A tab is active
              when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the activate opera&#8208;
              tion.  This overrides the widget&apos;s -activebackground option.

       -activeforeground color
              Sets the default active foreground color nameOrIndex.   A  tab  is
              &quot;active&quot;  when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the acti&#8208;
              vate operation.  Individual tabs may override this option by  set&#8208;
              ting the tab&apos;s -activeforeground option.

       -anchor anchor
              Anchors  the  tab&apos;s  embedded  widget  to a particular edge of the
              folder.  This option has effect only if the space  in  the  folder
              surrounding  the embedded widget is larger than the widget itself.
              Anchor specifies how the widget will be positioned  in  the  extra
              space.   For  example, if anchor is center then the window is cen&#8208;
              tered in the folder ; if anchor is  w  then  the  window  will  be
              aligned with the leftmost edge of the folder. The default value is
              center.

       -background color
              Sets the background color for nameOrIndex.   Setting  this  option
              overrides the widget&apos;s -tabbackground option.

       -bindtags tagList
              Specifies  the  binding  tags  for this tab.  TagList is a list of
              binding tag names.  The tags and their order  will  determine  how
              commands  for  events  in  tabs are invoked.  Each tag in the list
              matching the event sequence will have its  Tcl  command  executed.
              Implicitly  the  name  of  the  tab is always the first tag in the
              list.  The default value is all.

       -command string
              Specifies a Tcl script to be associated  with  nameOrIndex.   This
              command  is  typically  invoked when left mouse button is released
              over the tab.  Setting this option overrides the widget&apos;s -select&#8208;
              command option.

       -data string
              Specifies  a string to be associated with nameOrIndex.  This value
              isn&apos;t used in the widget code.  It may be used in Tcl bindings  to
              associate  extra data (other than the image or text) with the tab.
              The default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -fill fill
              If the space in the folder surrounding the tab&apos;s  embedded  widget
              is  larger  than  the  widget, then fill indicates if the embedded
              widget should be stretched to occupy the  extra  space.   Fill  is
              either none, x, y, both.  For example, if fill is x, then the wid&#8208;
              get is stretched horizontally.   If  fill  is  y,  the  widget  is
              stretched vertically.  The default is none.

       -font fontName
              Sets  the font for the text in tab labels.  If fontName is not the
              empty string, this  overrides  the  tabset&apos;s  -font  option.   The
              default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -foreground color
              Sets  the color of the label for nameOrIndex.  If color is not the
              empty string, this overrides the widget&apos;s  -tabforeground  option.
              The default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -image imageName
              Specifies  the  image  to  be  drawn in label for nameOrIndex.  If
              image is &quot;&quot;, no image will be drawn.  Both text and images may  be
              displayed  at  the  same time in tab labels.  The default value is
              &quot;&quot;.

       -ipadx pad
              Sets the padding to the left and right of the label.  Pad can be a
              list of one or two screen distances.  If pad has two elements, the
              left side of the label is padded by the  first  distance  and  the
              right  side by the second.  If pad has just one distance, both the
              left and right sides are padded evenly.  The default value is 0.

       -ipady pad
              Sets the padding to the top and bottom of the label.  Pad can be a
              list of one or two screen distances.  If pad has two elements, the
              top of the label is padded by the first distance and the bottom by
              the second.  If pad has just one distance, both the top and bottom
              sides are padded evenly.  The default value is 0.

       -padx pad
              Sets the padding around the left and right of the embedded widget,
              if  one exists.  Pad can be a list of one or two screen distances.
              If pad has two elements, the left side of the widget is padded  by
              the  first  distance and the right side by the second.  If pad has
              just one distance, both  the  left  and  right  sides  are  padded
              evenly.  The default value is 0.

       -pady pad
              Sets the padding around the top and bottom of the embedded widget,
              if one exists.  Pad can be a list of one or two screen  distances.
              If  pad  has  two elements, the top of the widget is padded by the
              first distance and the bottom by the second.  If pad has just  one
              distance,  both  the  top and bottom sides are padded evenly.  The
              default value is 0.

       -selectbackground color
              Sets the color to use when displaying background of  the  selected
              tab. If color is not the empty string, this overrides the widget&apos;s
              -selectbackground option. The default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -shadow color
              Sets the shadow color for the text in the tab&apos;s label. Drop  shad&#8208;
              ows  are useful when both the foreground and background of the tab
              have similar color intensities.  If color is the empty string,  no
              shadow is drawn.  The default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -state state
              Sets the state of the tab. If state is disable the text of the tab
              is drawn as engraved and operations on the tab (such as invoke and
              tab tearoff) are ignored.  The default is normal.

       -stipple bitmap
              Specifies  a  stipple  pattern  to  use  for the background of the
              folder when the window is torn off.  Bitmap specifies a bitmap  to

       -text text
              Specifies  the text of the tab&apos;s label.  The exact way the text is
              drawn may be affected by other options such as -state or -rotate.

       -window pathName
              Specifies the widget to be embedded into the tab.   PathName  must
              be  a child of the tabset widget.  The tabset will &quot;pack&quot; and man&#8208;
              age the size and placement of pathName.  The default value is &quot;&quot;.

       -windowheight pixels
              Sets the requested height of the page.  The page is the area under
              the  tab  used  to display the page contents.  If pixels is 0, the
              maximum height of all embedded tab windows is used.   The  default
              is 0.

       -windowwidth pixels
              Sets  the requested width of the page.  The page is the area under
              the tab used to display the page contents.  If pixels  is  0,  the
              maximum width of all embedded tab windows is used.  The default is
              0.

DEFAULT BINDINGS
       BLT automatically generates class  bindings  that  supply  tabsets  their
       default  behaviors.  The following event sequences are set by default for
       tabsets (via the class bind tag Tabset):

       &lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;

       &lt;B2-Motion&gt;

       &lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;
              Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If  it  is  pressed  and
              dragged  over  the tabset, the contents of the tabset drag at high
              speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       &lt;KeyPress-Up&gt;

       &lt;KeyPress-Down&gt;
              The up and down arrow keys move the focus to the  tab  immediately
              above or below the current focus tab.  The tab with focus is drawn
              with the a dashed outline around the tab label.

       &lt;KeyPress-Left&gt;

       &lt;KeyPress-Right&gt;
              The left and right arrow keys move the focus to  the  tab  immedi&#8208;
              ately to the left or right of the current focus tab.  The tab with
              focus is drawn with the a dashed outline around the tab label.

       &lt;KeyPress-space&gt;

       &lt;KeyPress-Return&gt;
              The space and return keys select  the  current  tab  given  focus.
              When  a folder is selected, it&apos;s command is invoked and the embed&#8208;
              ded widget is mapped.

       Each tab, by default, also has a set  of  bindings  (via  the  tag  all).
       These bindings may be reset using the tabset&apos;s bind operation.

       &lt;Enter&gt;

       &lt;Leave&gt;
              When  the  mouse pointer enters a tab, it is activated (i.e. drawn
              in its active colors) and when the pointer leaves, it  is  redrawn
              in its normal colors.

       &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;
              Clicking  with the left mouse button on a tab causes the tab to be
              selected and its Tcl script (see the  -command  or  -selectcommand
              options)  to  be  invoked.  The folder and any embedded widget (if
              one is specified) is automatically mapped.

       &lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;

       &lt;Control-ButtonRelease-1&gt;
              Clicking on the right mouse button (or the left mouse button  with
              the Control key held down) tears off the current page into its own
              toplevel widget. The embedded  widget  is  re-packed  into  a  new
              toplevel  and  an  outline  of  the widget is drawn in the folder.
              Clicking again (toggling) will reverse this operation and  replace
              the page back in the folder.

BIND TAGS
       You  can bind commands to tabs that are triggered when a particular event
       sequence occurs in them, much like canvas items in  Tk&apos;s  canvas  widget.
       Not  all  event sequences are valid.  The only binding events that may be
       specified are those related to the mouse and  keyboard  (such  as  Enter,
       Leave, ButtonPress, Motion, and KeyPress).

       It  is  possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.  This
       could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the tab  name
       and another is associated with the tab&apos;s tags (see the -bindtags option).
       When this occurs, all the matching bindings are invoked.  A binding asso&#8208;
       ciated  with  the  tab name is invoked first, followed by one binding for
       each of the tab&apos;s bindtags.  If there are multiple matching bindings  for
       a single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked.  A continue
       command in a binding script terminates that script, and a  break  command
       terminates  that  script  and  skips any remaining scripts for the event,
       just as for the bind command.

       The -bindtags option for tabs controls addition tag  names  that  can  be
       matched.  Implicitly the first tag for each tab is its name.  Setting the
       value of the -bindtags option doesn&apos;t change this.

EXAMPLE
       You create a tabset widget with the tabset command.

              # Create a new tabset
              tabset .ts -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

       A new Tcl command .ts is also created.  This command can be used to query
       and  modify  the tabset.  For example, to change the default font used by
       all the tab labels, you use the new command and  the  tabset&apos;s  configure
       operation.

              # Change the default font.
              .ts configure -font &quot;fixed&quot;

       You can then add folders using the insert operation.

              # Create a new folder &quot;f1&quot;
              .ts insert 0 &quot;f1&quot;

       This  inserts  the new tab named &quot;f1&quot; into the tabset.  The index 0 indi&#8208;
       cates location to insert the new tab.  You can also use the index end  to
       append  a  tab to the end of the tabset.  By default, the text of the tab
       is the name of the tab.  You can change this  by  configuring  the  -text
       option.

              # Change the label of &quot;f1&quot;
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -text &quot;Tab #1&quot;

       The insert operation lets you add one or more folders at a time.

              .ts insert end &quot;f2&quot; -text &quot;Tab #2&quot; &quot;f3&quot; &quot;f4&quot;

       The  tab  on  each  folder contains a label.  A label may display both an
       image and a text string.  You can reconfigure the tab&apos;s attributes (fore&#8208;
       ground/background  colors,  font,  rotation, etc) using the tab configure
       operation.

              # Add an image to the label of &quot;f1&quot;
              set image [image create photo -file stopsign.gif]
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -image $image
              .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -rotate 90

       Each folder may contain an embedded widget  to  represent  its  contents.
       The  widget  to  be embedded must be a child of the tabset widget.  Using
       the -window option, you specify the name of widget to be  embedded.   But
       don&apos;t pack the widget, the tabset takes care of placing and arranging the
       widget for you.

              graph .ts.graph
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot; \
                  -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       The size of the folder is determined the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded
       inside  each  folder.  The folder will be as wide as the widest widget in
       any folder. The tallest determines the height.  You  can  use  the  tab&apos;s
       -pagewidth and -pageheight options override this.

       Other  options  control  how the widget appears in the folder.  The -fill
       option says that you wish to have the widget stretch to fill  the  avail&#8208;
       able space in the folder.

              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i


       Now  when you click the left mouse button on &quot;f1&quot;, the graph will be dis&#8208;
       played in the folder.  It  will  be  automatically  hidden  when  another
       folder is selected.  If you click on the right mouse button, the embedded
       widget will be moved into a toplevel widget of its own.   Clicking  again
       on the right mouse button puts it back into the folder.

       If  you  want to share a page between two different folders, the -command
       option lets you specify a Tcl command to be invoked whenever  the  folder
       is  selected.  You can reset the -window option for the tab whenever it&apos;s
       clicked.

              .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -command {
                  .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
              }
              .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -command {
                  .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
              }

       If you have many folders, you may wish to stack tabs in  multiple  tiers.
       The  tabset&apos;s  -tiers  option  requests  a maximum number of tiers.   The
       default is one tier.

              .ts configure -tiers 2

       If the tabs can fit in less tiers, the widget will use that many.   When&#8208;
       ever  there  are more tabs than can be displayed in the maximum number of
       tiers, the tabset will automatically let you scroll the  tabs.   You  can
       even attach a scrollbar to the tabset.

              .ts configure -scrollcommand { .sbar set }  -scrollincrement 20
              .sbar configure -orient horizontal -command { .ts view }

       By  default tabs are along the top of the tabset from left to right.  But
       tabs can be placed on any side of the tabset using the -side option.

              # Arrange tabs along the right side of the tabset.
              .ts configure -side right -rotate 270
