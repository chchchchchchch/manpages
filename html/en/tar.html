DESCRIPTION
       ::tar::contents tarball ?-chan?
              Returns a list of the files contained in tarball. The order is not
              sorted and depends on the order files were stored in the archive.

              If the option -chan is present tarball is interpreted as  an  open
              channel.   It  is assumed that the channel was opened for reading,
              and configured for binary input.  The command will not  close  the
              channel.

       ::tar::stat tarball ?file? ?-chan?
              Returns  a  nested dict containing information on the named ?file?
              in tarball, or all files if none is specified. The top  level  are
              pairs of filename and info. The info is a dict with the keys &quot;mode
              uid gid size mtime type linkname uname gname devmajor devminor&quot;


              % ::tar::stat tarball.tar
              foo.jpg {mode 0644 uid 1000 gid 0 size 7580 mtime 811903867 type file linkname {} uname user gname wheel devmajor 0 devminor 0}


       If the option -chan is present tarball is interpreted as an open channel.
       It is assumed that the channel was opened for reading, and configured for
       binary input.  The command will not close the channel.

       ::tar::untar tarball args
              Extracts tarball. -file and -glob limit the  extraction  to  files
              which  exactly match or pattern match the given argument. No error
              is thrown if no files match. Returns a list of filenames extracted
              and  the  file  size. The size will be null for non regular files.
              Leading path seperators are stripped so paths will always be rela&#8208;
              tive.

              -dir dirName
                     Directory to extract to. Uses pwd if none is specified
&#12;              -file fileName
                     Only  extract  the file with this name. The name is matched
                     against the complete path stored in the  archive  including
                     directories.

              -glob pattern
                     Only  extract  files  patching this glob style pattern. The
                     pattern is matched against the complete path stored in  the
                     archive.

              -nooverwrite
                     Dont overwrite files that already exist

              -nomtime
                     Leave  the  file  modification  time  as  the  current time
                     instead of setting it to the value in the archive.

              -noperms
                     In Unix, leave the file permissions as  the  current  umask
                     instead of setting them to the values in the archive.

              -chan  If this option is present tarball is interpreted as an open
                     channel.  It is assumed that the  channel  was  opened  for
                     reading, and configured for binary input.  The command will
                     not close the channel.



              % foreach {file size} [::tar::untar tarball.tar -glob *.jpg] {
              puts &quot;Extracted $file ($size bytes)&quot;
              }


       ::tar::get tarball fileName ?-chan?
              Returns the contents of fileName from the tarball



              % set readme [::tar::get tarball.tar doc/README] {
              % puts $readme
              }


       If the option -chan is present tarball is interpreted as an open channel.
       It is assumed that the channel was opened for reading, and configured for
       binary input.  The command will not close the channel.

       ::tar::create tarball files args
              Creates a new tar file containing the files. files must be  speci&#8208;
              fied as a single argument which is a proper list of filenames.

              -dereference
                     Normally create will store links as an actual link pointing
                     at a file that may or may not exist in the archive.  Speci&#8208;
                     fying  this  option  will cause the actual file point to by
                     the link to be stored instead.

              -chan  If this option is present tarball is interpreted as an open
                     channel.   It  is  assumed  that the channel was opened for
                     writing, and configured for  binary  output.   The  command
                     will not close the channel.



              % ::tar::create new.tar [glob -nocomplain file*]
              % ::tar::contents new.tar
              file1 file2 file3


       ::tar::add tarball files args
              Appends  files  to  the end of the existing tarball. files must be
              specified as a single argument which is a  proper  list  of  file&#8208;
              names.

              -dereference
                     Normally add will store links as an actual link pointing at
                     a file that may or may not exist in the archive. Specifying
                     this option will cause the actual file point to by the link
                     to be stored instead.

              -prefix string
                     Normally add will store files under exactly the name speci&#8208;
                     fied  as argument. Specifying a ?-prefix? causes the string
                     to be prepended to every name.

              -quick The only sure way to find the position in the tarball where
                     new  files  can  be  added is to read it from start, but if
                     tarball was written with a &quot;blocksize&quot; of 1 (as this  pack&#8208;
                     age  does) then one can alternatively find this position by
                     seeking from the end. The ?-quick? option tells add  to  do
                     the latter.


       ::tar::remove tarball files
              Removes  files  from the tarball. No error will result if the file
              does not exist in the tarball. Directory write permission and free
              disk  space equivalent to at least the size of the tarball will be
              needed.


              % ::tar::remove new.tar {file2 file3}
              % ::tar::contents new.tar
              file3
