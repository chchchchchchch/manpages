TCGETSID(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                TCGETSID(3)



NAME
       tcgetsid - get session ID

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500        /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       pid_t tcgetsid(int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  tcgetsid()  returns  the session ID of the current session
       that has the terminal associated to fd  as  controlling  terminal.   This
       terminal must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.

RETURN VALUE
       When  fd  refers to the controlling terminal of our session, the function
       tcgetsid() will return the session ID of this session.  Otherwise, -1  is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTTY The  calling  process  does not have a controlling terminal, or it
              has one but it is not described by fd.

VERSIONS
       tcgetsid() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       This function is implemented via the  TIOCGSID  ioctl(2),  present  since
       Linux 2.1.71.
