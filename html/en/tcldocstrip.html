NAME
       tcldocstrip - Tcl-based Docstrip Processor

SYNOPSIS
       tcldocstrip output ?options? input ?guards?

       tcldocstrip ?options? output (?options? input guards)...

       tcldocstrip -guards input

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The application described by this document, tcldocstrip, is a relative of
       docstrip, a simple literate programming tool for LaTeX.

       tcldocstrip is based upon the package docstrip.

   USE CASES
       tcldocstrip was written with the following three use cases in mind.

       [1]    Conversion of a single input file according to the  listed  guards
              into  the  stripped output. This handles the most simple case of a
              set of guards specifying a single document found in a single input
              file.

       [2]    Stitching,  or  the  assembly  of  an  output from several sets of
              guards, in a specific order, and possibly  from  different  files.
              This  is  the second common case. One document spread over several
              inputs, and/or spread over different guard sets.

       [3]    Extraction and listing of all the  unique  guard  expressions  and
              guards  used  within  a  document  to  help a person which did not
              author the document in question in familiarizing itself with it.

   COMMAND LINE
       tcldocstrip output ?options? input ?guards?
              This is the form for use case [1].  It  converts  the  input  file
              according to the specified guards and options. The result is writ&#8208;
              ten to the named output file.  Usage of the string - as  the  name
              of the output signals that the result should be written to stdout.
              The guards are document-specific and have to be known to the call&#8208;
              er. The options will be explained later, in section OPTIONS.

              path output (in)
                     This  argument specifies where to write the generated docu&#8208;
                     ment. It can be the path to a file or directory, or -.  The
                     last  value  causes  the application to write the generated
                     documented to stdout.

                     If the output does not exist then  [file  dirname  $output]
                     has to exist and must be a writable directory.

              path inputfile (in)
                     This argument specifies the path to the file to process. It
                     has to exist, must be readable,  and  written  in  docstrip
                     format.


       tcldocstrip ?options? output (?options? input guards)...
              This  is  the  form for use case [2]. It differs from the form for
              use case [1] by the possibility of having options before the  out&#8208;
              put  file,  which  apply  in general, and specifying more than one
              inputfile, each with its own set of  input  specific  options  and
              guards.

              It  extracts  data  from the various input files, according to the
              specified options and guards, and writes the result to  the  given
              output,  in  the order of their specification on the command line.
              Options specified before the output are global  settings,  whereas
              the  options  specified  before each input are valid only just for
              this input file. Unspecified values are taken from the global set&#8208;
              tings,  or  defaults. As for form [1] using the string - as output
              causes the application to write to stdout.  Using the string . for
              an  input  file  signals  that  the last input file should be used
              again. This enables the assembly of the output from one input file
              using  multiple  and  different  sets of guards, without having to
              specify the full name of the file every time.

       tcldocstrip -guards input
              This is the form for use case [3].  It determines the guards,  and
              unique  guard expressions used within the provided input document.
              The found strings are written to stdout, one string per line.

   OPTIONS
       This section describes all the options  available  to  the  user  of  the
       application,  with  the  exception of the option -guards. This option was
       described already, in section COMMAND LINE.

       -metaprefix string
              This option is inherited from the command  docstrip::extract  pro&#8208;
              vided by the package docstrip.

              It  specifies the string by which the &apos;%%&apos; prefix of a metacomment
              line will be replaced. Defaults to &apos;%%&apos;. For Tcl code  this  would
              typically be &apos;#&apos;.

       -onerror mode
              This  option  is inherited from the command docstrip::extract pro&#8208;
              vided by the package docstrip.

              It controls what will be done when a  format  error  in  the  text
              being processed is detected. The settings are:

              ignore Just ignore the error; continue as if nothing happened.

              puts   Write an error message to stderr, then continue processing.

              throw  Throw  an  error.  ::errorCode is set to a list whose first
                     element is DOCSTRIP, second element is the type  of  error,
                     and  third  element  is  the line number where the error is
                     detected. This is the default.

       -trimlines bool
              This option is inherited from the command  docstrip::extract  pro&#8208;
              vided by the package docstrip.

              Controls  whether  spaces  at  the end of a line should be trimmed
              away before the line is processed. Defaults to true.

       -preamble text

       -postamble text

       -nopreamble

       -nopostamble
              The -no*amble options deactivate file pre-  and  postambles  alto&#8208;
              gether,  whereas  the -*amble options specify the user part of the
              file pre- and postambles. This part can be  empty,  in  that  case
              only the standard parts are shown. This is the default.

              Preambles, when active, are written before the actual content of a
              generated file. In the same manner postambles  are,  when  active,
              written after the actual content of a generated file.
