NAME
       tclsh - Simple shell containing Tcl interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       tclsh ?-encoding name? ?fileName arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Tclsh  is a shell-like application that reads Tcl commands from its stan&#8208;
       dard input or from a file and evaluates them.  If invoked with  no  argu&#8208;
       ments  then  it  runs  interactively,  reading Tcl commands from standard
       input and printing command results and error messages to standard output.
       It runs until the exit command is invoked or until it reaches end-of-file
       on its standard input.  If there exists a file .tclshrc  (or  tclshrc.tcl
       on  the Windows platforms) in the home directory of the user, interactive
       tclsh evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before  reading  the  first
       command from standard input.


SCRIPT FILES
       If  tclsh  is invoked with arguments then the first few arguments specify &#9474;
       the name of a script file, and, optionally, the encoding of the text data &#9474;
       stored  in that script file.  Any additional arguments are made available
       to the script as variables (see below).  Instead of reading commands from
       standard  input  tclsh will read Tcl commands from the named file;  tclsh
       will exit when it reaches the end of the file.  The end of the  file  may
       be  marked either by the physical end of the medium, or by the character,
       &#8220;\032&#8221; (&#8220;\u001a&#8221;, control-Z).  If this character is present in the  file,
       the  tclsh application will read text up to but not including the charac&#8208;
       ter.  An application that requires this character in the file may  safely
       encode  it  as  &#8220;\032&#8221;, &#8220;\x1a&#8221;, or &#8220;\u001a&#8221;; or may generate it by use of
       commands such as format or binary.  There is no automatic  evaluation  of
       .tclshrc when the name of a script file is presented on the tclsh command
       line, but the script file can always source it if desired.

       If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
              #!/usr/local/bin/tclsh
       then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you  mark
       the  file  as  executable.  This assumes that tclsh has been installed in
       the default location in /usr/local/bin;  if  it  is  installed  somewhere
       else  then  you  will  have to modify the above line to match.  Many UNIX
       systems do not allow the #! line to exceed about 30 characters in length,
       so  be  sure  that the tclsh executable can be accessed with a short file
       name.

       An even better approach is to start your script files with the  following
       three lines:
              #!/bin/sh
              # the next line restarts using tclsh \
              exec tclsh &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
       This  approach  has  three  advantages  over the approach in the previous
       paragraph.  First, the location of the tclsh binary does not have  to  be
       hard-wired  into  the  script:   it  can be anywhere in your shell search
       path.  Second, it gets around the 30-character file  name  limit  in  the
       previous  approach.   Third,  this  approach  will  work even if tclsh is
       itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in  order  to  handle
       multiple  architectures  or  operating systems:  the tclsh script selects
       one of several binaries to run).  The three lines cause both sh and tclsh
       to process the script, but the exec is only executed by sh.  sh processes
       the script first;  it treats the second line as a  comment  and  executes
       the  third  line.   The exec statement cause the shell to stop processing
       and instead to start up tclsh to reprocess the entire script.  When tclsh
       starts  up, it treats all three lines as comments, since the backslash at
       the end of the second line causes the third line to be treated as part of
       the comment on the second line.

       You should note that it is also common practice to install tclsh with its
       version number as part of the name.  This has the advantage  of  allowing
       multiple  versions  of  Tcl to exist on the same system at once, but also
       the disadvantage of making it harder to write scripts that start up  uni&#8208;
       formly across different versions of Tcl.


VARIABLES
       Tclsh sets the following Tcl variables:

       argc           Contains  a  count  of  the  number of arg arguments (0 if
                      none), not including the name of the script file.

       argv           Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the arg  arguments,
                      in  order,  or  an  empty string if there are no arg argu&#8208;
                      ments.

       argv0          Contains fileName if it was  specified.   Otherwise,  con&#8208;
                      tains the name by which tclsh was invoked.

       tcl_interactive
                      Contains  1 if tclsh is running interactively (no fileName
                      was  specified  and  standard  input  is  a  terminal-like
                      device), 0 otherwise.


PROMPTS
       When  tclsh is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each command
       with  &#8220;%  &#8221;.   You  can  change  the  prompt  by  setting  the  variables
       tcl_prompt1 and tcl_prompt2.  If variable tcl_prompt1 exists then it must
       consist of a Tcl script to output a  prompt;   instead  of  outputting  a
       prompt  tclsh  will  evaluate  the  script  in tcl_prompt1.  The variable
       tcl_prompt2 is used in a similar way when a newline is typed but the cur&#8208;
       rent  command  is  not  yet  complete;  if tcl_prompt2 is not set then no
       prompt is output for incomplete commands.
