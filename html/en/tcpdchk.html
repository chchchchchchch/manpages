TCPDCHK(8)                                                            TCPDCHK(8)



NAME
       tcpdchk - tcp wrapper configuration checker

SYNOPSIS
       tcpdchk [-a] [-d] [-i inet_conf] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       tcpdchk examines your tcp wrapper configuration and reports all potential
       and real problems it can find. The program examines the tcpd access  con&#8208;
       trol  files (by default, these are /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny),
       and compares the entries in these files against entries in the inetd net&#8208;
       work configuration file.

       tcpdchk  reports  problems  such as non-existent pathnames; services that
       appear in tcpd access control rules, but are not controlled by tcpd; ser&#8208;
       vices that should not be wrapped; non-existent host names or non-internet
       address forms; occurrences of  host  aliases  instead  of  official  host
       names;  hosts with a name/address conflict; inappropriate use of wildcard
       patterns; inappropriate use of NIS netgroups or references  to  non-exis&#8208;
       tent NIS netgroups; references to non-existent options; invalid arguments
       to options; and so on.

       Where possible, tcpdchk provides a helpful suggestion to fix the problem.

OPTIONS
       -a     Report access control rules that permit access without an explicit
              ALLOW keyword.

       -d     Examine  hosts.allow and hosts.deny files in the current directory
              instead of the default ones.

       -i inet_conf
              Specify this option when tcpdchk is unable to find your inetd.conf
              network  configuration  file, or when you suspect that the program
              uses the wrong one.

       -v     Display the contents of each access control rule.   Daemon  lists,
              client  lists,  shell  commands and options are shown in a pretty-
              printed format; this makes it easier for you to spot any  discrep&#8208;
              ancies between what you want and what the program understands.

FILES
       The default locations of the tcpd access control tables are:

       /etc/hosts.allow
       /etc/hosts.deny
