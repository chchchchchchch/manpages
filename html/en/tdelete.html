       void tdestroy(void *root, void (*free_node)(void *nodep));

DESCRIPTION
       tsearch(),  tfind(),  twalk(),  and tdelete() manage a binary tree.  They
       are generalized from Knuth (6.2.2) Algorithm T.  The first field in  each
       node of the tree is a pointer to the corresponding data item.  (The call&#8208;
       ing program must store the actual data.)  compar points to  a  comparison
       routine,  which takes pointers to two items.  It should return an integer
       which is negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether the first item
       is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

       tsearch()  searches  the  tree for an item.  key points to the item to be
       searched for.  rootp points to a variable which points to the root of the
       tree.   If  the  tree  is  empty,  then the variable that rootp points to
       should be set to NULL.  If the item is found in the tree, then  tsearch()
       returns a pointer to it.  If it is not found, then tsearch() adds it, and
       returns a pointer to the newly added item.

       tfind() is like tsearch(), except that if the item  is  not  found,  then
       tfind() returns NULL.

       tdelete()  deletes  an item from the tree.  Its arguments are the same as
       for tsearch().

       twalk() performs depth-first, left-to-right traversal of a  binary  tree.
       root  points to the starting node for the traversal.  If that node is not
       the root, then only part of the tree will be visited.  twalk() calls  the
       user  function  action  each time a node is visited (that is, three times
       for an internal node, and once for a leaf).  action, in turn, takes three
       arguments.   The  first  argument is a pointer to the node being visited.
       The structure of the node is unspecified, but it is possible to cast  the
       pointer to a pointer-to-pointer-to-element in order to access the element
       stored within the node.  The application must not  modify  the  structure
       pointed  to  by  this  argument.  The second argument is an integer which
       takes one of the values preorder, postorder,  or  endorder  depending  on
       whether  this  is the first, second, or third visit to the internal node,
       or the value leaf if this is the single visit to  a  leaf  node.   (These
       symbols  are  defined in &lt;search.h&gt;.)  The third argument is the depth of
       the node; the root node has depth zero.
&#12;       (More commonly, preorder, postorder, and endorder are known as  preorder,
       inorder, and postorder: before visiting the children, after the first and
       before the second, and after visiting the children.  Thus, the choice  of
       name postorder is rather confusing.)

       tdestroy()  removes  the  whole  tree  pointed  to  by  root, freeing all
       resources allocated by the tsearch() function.  For the data in each tree
       node the function free_node is called.  The pointer to the data is passed
       as the argument to the function.  If no such work is necessary, free_node
       must point to a function doing nothing.

RETURN VALUE
       tsearch()  returns  a  pointer  to a matching item in the tree, or to the
       newly added item, or NULL if there was insufficient  memory  to  add  the
       item.   tfind()  returns  a  pointer  to the item, or NULL if no match is
       found.  If there are multiple elements that match the  key,  the  element
       returned is unspecified.

       tdelete() returns a pointer to the parent of the item deleted, or NULL if
       the item was not found.

       tsearch(), tfind(), and tdelete() also return NULL if rootp was  NULL  on
       entry.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.  The function tdestroy() is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       twalk()  takes  a  pointer  to the root, while the other functions take a
       pointer to a variable which points to the root.

       tdelete() frees the memory required for the node in the tree.   The  user
       is responsible for freeing the memory for the corresponding data.

       The  example  program  depends  on the fact that twalk() makes no further
       reference to a  node  after  calling  the  user  function  with  argument
       &quot;endorder&quot;  or  &quot;leaf&quot;.   This works with the GNU library implementation,
       but is not in the System V documentation.

EXAMPLE
       The following program inserts twelve random numbers into a  binary  tree,
       where duplicate numbers are collapsed, then prints the numbers in order.

       #define _GNU_SOURCE     /* Expose declaration of tdestroy() */
       #include &lt;search.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       void *root = NULL;

       void *
       xmalloc(unsigned n)
       {
           void *p;
           p = malloc(n);
           if (p)
               return p;
           fprintf(stderr, &quot;insufficient memory\n&quot;);
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       int
       compare(const void *pa, const void *pb)
       {
           if (*(int *) pa &lt; *(int *) pb)
               return -1;
           if (*(int *) pa &gt; *(int *) pb)
               return 1;
           return 0;
       }

       void
       action(const void *nodep, const VISIT which, const int depth)
       {
           int *datap;

           switch (which) {
           case preorder:
               break;
           case postorder:
               datap = *(int **) nodep;
               printf(&quot;%6d\n&quot;, *datap);
               break;
           case endorder:
               break;
           case leaf:
               datap = *(int **) nodep;
               printf(&quot;%6d\n&quot;, *datap);
               break;
           }
       }

       int
       main(void)
       {
           int i, *ptr;
           void *val;

           srand(time(NULL));
           for (i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) {
               ptr = xmalloc(sizeof(int));
               *ptr = rand() &amp; 0xff;
               val = tsearch((void *) ptr, &amp;root, compare);
               if (val == NULL)
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               else if ((*(int **) val) != ptr)
                   free(ptr);
           }
           twalk(root, action);
           tdestroy(root, free);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
