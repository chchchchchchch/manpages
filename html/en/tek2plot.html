TEK2PLOT(1)                  GNU Plotting Utilities                  TEK2PLOT(1)



NAME
       tek2plot - translate Tektronix files to other graphics formats

SYNOPSIS
       tek2plot [ options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       tek2plot  translates  Tektronix  graphics files to other formats, or dis&#8208;
       plays them on an X Window System display.  The output format is specified
       with  the  -T  option.  The possible output formats are the same as those
       supported by graph(1), plot(1), pic2plot(1), and plotfont(1).  If an out&#8208;
       put file is produced, it is written to standard output.

       Options  and  file names may be interspersed on the command line, but the
       options are processed before the file names are read.  If -- is seen,  it
       is  interpreted  as  the end of the options.  If no file names are speci&#8208;
       fied, or the file name - is encountered, the standard input is read.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -T type
       --output-format type
              Select type as the output format.  It may be  &quot;X&quot;,  &quot;png&quot;,  &quot;pnm&quot;,
              &quot;gif&quot;,  &quot;svg&quot;,  &quot;ai&quot;,  &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;, &quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;,
              &quot;tek&quot;, or &quot;meta&quot; (the default).  These refer respectively to the X
              Window  System,  PNG  (Portable Network Graphics) format, portable
              anymap format (PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use
              LZW  encoding,  the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format,
              the format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript  or  Encapsulated
              Postscript  (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), CGM format (by
              default, confirming to the WebCGM profile), the format used by the
              xfig(1)  drawing  editor,  the  Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer lan&#8208;
              guage, the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics  for&#8208;
              mat  (which can be displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or
              by a VT330  or  VT340  terminal),  Tektronix  format  itself,  and
              device-independent  GNU  metafile  format.  Unless type is &quot;X&quot;, an
              output file is produced and written to standard output.

              Omitting the -T option is equivalent to specifying -T  meta.   GNU
              metafile format may be translated to other formats with plot(1).

       -p n
       --page-number n
              Output  only  page number n, within the Tektronix file or sequence
              of Tektronix files that is being translated.  n must be a non-neg&#8208;
              ative  integer,  since a Tektronix file may consist of one or more
              pages, numbered beginning with zero.

              The default behavior if the -p option is not used is to output all
              nonempty pages in succession.  For example, tek2plot -T X displays
              each Tektronix page in its own X window.  If the -T png,  -T  pnm,
              -T  gif,  -T ai, or -T fig option is used, the default behavior is
              to output only the first nonempty Tektronix page, since  files  in
              those output formats contain only a single page of graphics.

              Most  Tektronix  files consist of either one page (page #0) or two
              pages (an empty page #0, and page #1).  Tektronix  files  produced
              by the GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by graph -T tek) are normally
              of the latter sort.

       -F name
       --font-name name
              Use the font name for rendering the native Textronix fonts, if  it
              is  available.   The default font is &quot;Courier&quot; except for tek2plot
              -T png, tek2plot -T  pnm,  tek2plot  -T  gif,  tek2plot  -T  hpgl,
              tek2plot  -T regis, and tek2plot -T tek, for which it is &quot;Hershey&#8208;
              Serif&quot;.  A list of  available  fonts  can  be  obtained  with  the
              --help-fonts  option  (see  below).  If a font outside the Courier
              family is used, the --position-chars  option  (see  below)  should
              probably be specified.

              The  -F  option  is  useful only if you have a Tektronix file that
              draws text using native Tektronix fonts.  Tektronix files produced
              by  the  GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by graph -T tek) do not use
              native Tektronix fonts: they use Hershey vector fonts instead.

       -W line_width
       --line-width line_width
              Set the width of lines, as a fraction of the width of the display,
              to  be  line_width.   A  negative value means that a default value
              should be used.  This value is format-dependent.  The  interpreta&#8208;
              tion  of  zero line width is also format-dependent (in some output
              formats, a zero-width line is the thinnest line that can be drawn;
              in others, a zero-width line is invisible).

       --bg-color name
              Set  the  color used for the background to be name.  This is rele&#8208;
              vant only to tek2plot -T X, tek2plot  -T  png,  tek2plot  -T  pnm,
              tek2plot -T gif, tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T cgm, and tek2plot -T
              regis.  An unrecognized name sets the color to the default,  which
              is &quot;white&quot;.  The environment variable BG_COLOR can equally well be
              used to specify the background color.  If the -T  svg  or  -T  cgm
              option  is  used,  an output file without a background may be pro&#8208;
              duced by setting the background color to &quot;none&quot;.

              If the -T png or -T gif option is used, a transparent PNG file  or
              a transparent pseudo-GIF, respectively, may be produced by setting
              the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable  to  the  name  of  the
              background color.

       --bitmap-size bitmap_size
              Set  the  size  of  the graphics display in which the plot will be
              drawn, in terms of pixels, to  be  bitmap_size.   The  default  is
              &quot;570x570&quot;.   This is relevant only to plot -T X, plot -T png, plot
              -T pnm, and plot -T gif.  If you choose a rectangular (non-square)
              window size, the fonts in the plot will be scaled anisotropically,
              i.e., by different factors in the horizontal and  vertical  direc&#8208;
              tions.   For  plot -T X, this requires an X11R6 display.  Any font
              that cannot be scaled in this way will be replaced  by  a  default
              scalable font, such as the vector font &quot;HersheySerif&quot;.

              The  environment  variable  BITMAPSIZE can equally well be used to
              specify the  window  size.   For  backward  compatibility,  the  X
              resource Xplot.geometry may be used instead.

       --emulate-color option
              If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an appropri&#8208;
              ate shade of gray.  This is seldom useful,  except  when  using  `
              tek2plot -T pcl to prepare output for a PCL 5 device.  (Many mono&#8208;
              chrome PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome LaserJets, do a poor  job
              of  emulating  color  on their own.)  You may equally well request
              color emulation by setting the environment variable  EMULATE_COLOR
              to &quot;yes&quot;.

       --max-line-length max_line_length
              Set  the  maximum  number of points that a polygonal line may con&#8208;
              tain, before it is flushed out, to be  max_line_length.   If  this
              flushing occurs, the polygonal line will be split into two or more
              sub-lines, though the splitting should  not  be  noticeable.   The
              default value of max_line_length is 500.

              The reason for splitting long polygonal lines is that some display
              devices (e.g., old Postscript printers  and  HP-GL  pen  plotters)
              have    limited    buffer   sizes.    The   environment   variable
              MAX_LINE_LENGTH can also be  used  to  specify  the  maximum  line
              length.

       --page-size pagesize
              Set  the  size  of  the page on which the plot will be positioned.
              This is relevant only to tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T ai, tek2plot
              -T  ps,  tek2plot  -T  cgm,  tek2plot -T fig, tek2plot -T pcl, and
              tek2plot -T hpgl.  The default is &quot;letter&quot;,  which  means  an  8.5
              inch  by 11 inch page.  Any ISO page size in the range &quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot;
              or ANSI page size in the range &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot; may be  specified  (&quot;let&#8208;
              ter&quot;  is  an  alias  for  &quot;a&quot;  and &quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias for &quot;b&quot;).
              &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot; are recognized page sizes also.  The environ&#8208;
              ment  variable  PAGESIZE  can  equally well be used to specify the
              page size.

              The graphics display in which the plot is drawn will be  a  square
              region  that  would  occupy nearly the full width of the specified
              page.  An alternative size for the graphics display can be  speci&#8208;
              fied.   For  example,  the  page  size could be specified as &quot;let&#8208;
              ter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;,  or  &quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;.   For
              all  of  the  above  except tek2plot -T hpgl, the graphics display
              will, by default, be centered on the page.  For all of  the  above
              except  tek2plot  -T svg and tek2plot -T cgm, the graphics display
              may be repositioned manually, by specifying the  location  of  its
              lower  left corner, relative to the lower left corner of the page.
              For example, the page size could  be  specified  as  &quot;letter,xori&#8208;
              gin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;,  or &quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;.  It is
              also possible to specify an offset vector.  For example, the  page
              size  could be specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or &quot;letter,xoff&#8208;
              set=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or &quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;.  In SVG  format  and
              WebCGM  format  it is possible to specify the size of the graphics
              display, but not its position.

       --pen-color name
              Set the pen color to be name.  An unrecognized name sets  the  pen
              color to the default, which is &quot;black&quot;.

       --position-chars
              Position  the characters in each text string individually.  If the
              text font is not a member of the Courier family, and especially if
              it is not a fixed-width font, this option is recommended.  It will
              improve the appearance of text strings, at the price of making  it
              difficult  to  edit  the  output  file  with xfig(1), idraw(1), or
              Illustrator.

       --rotation angle
              Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees.   Recognized  values
              are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to
              &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respectively.  The environment variable ROTATION can
              also be used to specify a rotation angle.

       --use-tek-fonts
              Use  the  bitmap  fonts  that  were used on the original Tektronix
              4010/4014 terminal.  This option is relevant only to  tek2plot  -T
              X.   The four relevant bitmap fonts are distributed with most ver&#8208;
              sions of  the  GNU  plotting  utilities,  under  the  names  &quot;tek&#8208;
              font0&quot;...&quot;tekfont3&quot;.  They can easily be installed on any modern X
              Window System display.  For this option to work properly, you must
              also select a window size of 1024x1024 pixels, either by using the
              --bitmap-size 1024x1024 option or by  setting  the  value  of  the
              Xplot.geometry resource.  This is because bitmap fonts, unlike the
              scalable fonts that tek2plot normally uses, cannot be rescaled.

              This option is useful only if you have a file in Tektronix  format
              that  draws  text  using  native Tektronix fonts.  Tektronix files
              produced by the GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by graph -T tek)  do
              not  use  native  Tektronix  fonts:  they use Hershey vector fonts
              instead.

   Options for Metafile Output
       The following option is relevant only if the -T option is omitted  or  if
       -T  meta is used.  In this case tek2plot outputs a GNU graphics metafile,
       which must be translated to other formats with plot(1).

       -O
       --portable-output
              Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile  for&#8208;
              mat,  rather  than  a binary version (the default).  The format of
              the binary version is machine-dependent.

   Informational Options
       --help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.

       --help-fonts
              Print a table of available fonts, and exit.  The table will depend
              on  which output format is specified with the -T option.  tek2plot
              -T X, tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T ai, tek2plot -T ps, tek2plot -T
              cgm,  and  tek2plot -T fig each support the 35 standard Postscript
              fonts.  tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T pcl,  and  tek2plot  -T  hpgl
              support  the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter two support a
              number of Hewlett-Packard vector fonts.  All seven support  a  set
              of  22  Hershey  vector  fonts, as do tek2plot -T png, tek2plot -T
              pnm, tek2plot -T gif, tek2plot -T  regis,  and  tek2plot  -T  tek.
              tek2plot  without  a  -T option in principle supports any of these
              fonts, since its output must be translated to other  formats  with
              plot(1).

              The  plotfont(1)  utility may be used to obtain a character map of
              any supported font.

       --list-fonts
              Like --help-fonts, but lists the  fonts  in  a  single  column  to
              facilitate piping to other programs.  If no output format is spec&#8208;
              ified with the -T option, the  full  set  of  supported  fonts  is
              listed.

       --version
              Print  the  version  number of tek2plot and the plotting utilities
              package, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,  EMULATE_COLOR,
       MAX_LINE_LENGTH  and  ROTATION  serve  as  backups for the options --bit&#8208;
       map-size, --page-size,  --bg-color,  --emulate-color,  --max-line-length,
       and  --rotation,  respectively.   The remaining environment variables are
       specific to individual output formats.

       tek2plot -T X, which pops up a window on an X Window System  display  and
       draws graphics in it, checks the DISPLAY environment variable.  Its value
       determines the display that will be used.

       tek2plot -T png and tek2plot -T gif, which produce output in  PNG  format
       and  pseudo-GIF  format respectively, are affected by the INTERLACE envi&#8208;
       ronment variable.  If its value is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be  interlaced.
       Also, if the TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is set to the name of
       a color, that color will be treated as transparent in the output.

       tek2plot -T pnm, which produces output in portable  anymap  (PBM/PGM/PPM)
       format,  is  affected  by  the PNM_PORTABLE environment variable.  If its
       value is &quot;yes&quot;, the output will be in a human-readable format rather than
       binary (the default).

       tek2plot  -T  cgm,  which  produces  output  in  CGM  (Computer  Graphics
       Metafile) format, is affected by  the  CGM_MAX_VERSION  and  CGM_ENCODING
       environment  variables.  By default, it produces a binary-encoded version
       of CGM version 3 format.  For backward compatibility, the version  number
       may be reduced by setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.  Irrespective of
       version, the output CGM file  will  use  the  human-readable  clear  text
       encoding  if  CGM_ENCODING is set to &quot;clear_text&quot;.  However, only binary-
       encoded CGM files conform to the WebCGM profile.

       tek2plot -T pcl, which produces PCL 5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers
       and  plotters, is affected by the environment variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.
       It should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when producing PCL 5 output for a color printer
       or  other  color device.  This will ensure accurate color reproduction by
       giving the output device complete freedom  in  assigning  colors,  inter&#8208;
       nally,  to  its &quot;logical pens&quot;.  If it is &quot;no&quot; then the device will use a
       fixed set of colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading.  The
       default  is  &quot;no&quot;  because  monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are much more
       common than colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.

       tek2plot -T hpgl, which produces Hewlett-Packard Graphics  Language  out&#8208;
       put, is affected by several environment variables.  The most important is
       HPGL_VERSION, which may be set to &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the default).   &quot;1&quot;
       means  that the output should be generic HP-GL, &quot;1.5&quot; means that the out&#8208;
       put should be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and  the  HP758x,
       HP7595A  and  HP7596A  drafting  plotters (HP-GL with some HP-GL/2 exten&#8208;
       sions), and &quot;2&quot; means that the output should be modern HP-GL/2.   If  the
       version  is  &quot;1&quot;  or  &quot;1.5&quot;  then the only available fonts will be vector
       fonts, and all lines will be drawn with a default width  (the  -W  option
       will not work).

       The  position of the tek2plot -T hpgl graphics display on the page can be
       rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise by setting the  HPGL_ROTATE  environ&#8208;
       ment  variable  to  &quot;yes&quot;.  This is not the same as the rotation obtained
       with the --rotation option, since it both rotates  the  graphics  display
       and  repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of the page.
       Besides &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;,  &quot;90&quot;,
       &quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;.  &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;, respec&#8208;
       tively.  &quot;180&quot; and &quot;270&quot; are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is  &quot;2&quot;  (the
       default).

       By  default,  tek2plot -T hpgl will draw with a fixed set of pens.  Which
       pens are present may be specified by setting  the  HPGL_PENS  environment
       variable.   If  HPGL_VERSION  is  &quot;1&quot;,  the default value of HPGL_PENS is
       &quot;1=black&quot;; if  HPGL_VERSION  is  &quot;1.5&quot;  or  &quot;2&quot;,  the  default  value  of
       HPGL_PENS   is  &quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
       The format should be self-explanatory.   By  setting  HPGL_PENS  you  may
       specify  a color for any pen in the range #1...#31.  All color names rec&#8208;
       ognized by the X Window System may  be  used.   Pen  #1  must  always  be
       present,  though  it  need  not  be  black.   Any  other pen in the range
       #1...#31 may be omitted.

       If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; then tek2plot -T hpgl will also be affected by the
       environment  variable  HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS.   If  its value is &quot;yes&quot;, then
       tek2plot -T hpgl will not be  restricted  to  the  palette  specified  in
       HPGL_PENS: it will assign colors to &quot;logical pens&quot; in the range #1...#31,
       as needed.  The default value is &quot;no&quot; because other than  color  LaserJet
       printers  and  DesignJet  plotters,  not  many  HP-GL/2 devices allow the
       assignment of colors to logical pens.

       The drawing of visible white lines is supported only if  HPGL_VERSION  is
       &quot;2&quot; and the environment variable HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE is &quot;yes&quot; (the default).
       If its value is &quot;no&quot; then white lines (if any), which are normally  drawn
       with pen #0, will not be drawn.  This feature is to accommodate older HP-
       GL/2 devices.  HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example, do not support the  use
       of  pen  #0 to draw visible white lines.  Some older HP-GL/2 devices may,
       in fact, malfunction if asked to draw opaque objects.
