TEMPFILE(1)                                                          TEMPFILE(1)



NAME
       tempfile - create a temporary file in a safe manner

SYNOPSIS
       tempfile  [-d  DIR] [-p STRING] [-s STRING] [-m MODE] [-n FILE] [--direc&#8208;
       tory=DIR] [--prefix=STRING] [--suffix=STRING] [--mode=MODE] [--name=FILE]
       [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       tempfile  creates  a temporary file in a safe manner.  It uses tempnam(3)
       to choose the name and opens it with O_RDWR  |  O_CREAT  |  O_EXCL.   The
       filename  is  printed  on  standard output. See tempnam(3) for the actual
       steps involved in directory selection.

       The directory in which to create the file might be searched for  in  this
       order (but refer to tempnam(3) for authoritative answers):

       a) In  case  the environment variable TMPDIR exists and contains the name
          of an appropriate directory, that is used.

       b) Otherwise, if the --directory argument is specified  and  appropriate,
          it is used.

       c) Otherwise,  P_tmpdir  (as defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt;) is used when appropri&#8208;
          ate.

       d) Finally an implementation-defined directory (/tmp) may be used.

OPTIONS
       -d, --directory DIR
              Place the file in DIR.

       -m, --mode MODE
              Open the file with MODE instead of 0600.

       -n, --name FILE
              Use FILE for the name instead of tempnam(3).  The options -d,  -p,
              and -s are ignored if this option is given.

       -p, --prefix STRING
              Use up to five letters of STRING to generate the name.

       -s, --suffix STRING
              Generate the file with STRING as the suffix.

       --help Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       --version
              Print  version  information  on  standard output and exit success&#8208;
              fully.

RETURN VALUES
       An exit status of 0 means the temporary file  was  created  successfully.
       Any other exit status indicates an error.

BUGS
       Exclusive  creation  is  not guaranteed when creating files on NFS parti&#8208;
       tions.  tempfile cannot make temporary directories.  tempfile  is  depre&#8208;
       cated; you should use mktemp(1) instead.

EXAMPLE
              #!/bin/sh
              #[...]
              t=$(tempfile) || exit
              trap &quot;rm -f -- &apos;$t&apos;&quot; EXIT
              #[...]
              rm -f -- &quot;$t&quot;
              trap - EXIT
              exit
