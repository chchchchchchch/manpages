DESCRIPTION
       This  package  provides the most primitive commands for receiving charac&#8208;
       ters to a terminal. They are in essence convenient  wrappers  around  the
       builtin commands read and fileevent.

       ::term::receive::getch ?chan?
              This command reads a single character from the channel with handle
              chan and returns it as the result of the command.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

              It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the chan&#8208;
              nel  can  provide single characters. On unix this can be done, for
              example, by using the command of package term::ansi::ctrl::unix.

       ::term::receive::listen cmd ?chan?
              This command sets up a filevent listener for the channel with han&#8208;
              dle  chan  and  invokes the command prefix cmd whenever characters
              have been received, or EOF was reached.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

              The signature of the command prefix is

              cmd process string
                     This method is invoked when characters were  received,  and
                     string holds them for processing.

              cmd eof
                     This  method is invoked when EOF was reached on the channel
                     we listen on.  It will be the last call to be  received  by
                     the callback.

       ::term::receive::unlisten ?chan?
              This  command  disables the filevent listener for the channel with
              handle chan.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.
