DESCRIPTION
       This  package provides the most primitive commands for sending characters
       to a terminal. They are in essence convenient wrappers around the builtin
       command puts.

       ::term::send::wrch chan str
              Send the text str to the channel specified by the handle chan.  In
              contrast to the builtin command puts this command does not  termi&#8208;
              nate  the  string with a line terminator. It also forces an  flush
              of Tcl internal and OS buffers to ensure that the  characters  are
              processed immediately.

       ::term::send::wr str
              This  convenience  command is like ::term::send::wrch, except that
              the destination channel is fixed to stdout.
