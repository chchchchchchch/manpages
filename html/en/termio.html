TERMIO(7)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  TERMIO(7)



NAME
       termio - System V terminal driver interface

DESCRIPTION
       termio  is  the name of the old System V terminal driver interface.  This
       interface defined a termio structure used to store terminal settings, and
       a range of ioctl(2) operations to get and set terminal attributes.

       The  termio  interface is now obsolete: POSIX.1-1990 standardized a modi&#8208;
       fied version of this interface, under the name termios.  The POSIX.1 data
       structure differs slightly from the System V version, and POSIX.1 defined
       a suite of functions to replace  the  various  ioctl(2)  operations  that
       existed in System V.  (This was done because ioctl(2) was unstandardized,
       and its variadic third argument does not allow argument type checking.)

       If you&apos;re looking for page called &quot;termio&quot;, then you  can  probably  find
       most   of   the  information  that  you  seek  in  either  termios(3)  or
       tty_ioctl(4).
