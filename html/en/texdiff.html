NAME
       texdiff - Compares two (La)TeX documents to create a merged version show&#8208;
       ing changes, similar to that of &apos;Change Tracking&apos; in some word proces&#8208;
       sors.

SYNOPSIS
       texdiff [--nofloats&#9130;-n] old.tex new.tex [diff.tex]

DESCRIPTION
       The first two files are compared and a new TeX file is output. When the
       output file is processed with (La)TeX it marks new changes with blue and
       old text with red with a strike-through line. Furthermore, passages with
       changes are marked at the margin with grey bars by the LaTeX &quot;changebar&quot;
       package (although only after running &quot;dvips&quot;, in &quot;xdvi&quot; the bars are one
       inch too far left to compensate the one inch offset inserted by TeX
       printer drivers).

       &quot;texdiff&quot; uses and therefore requires the &quot;wdiff&quot; command to insert these
       marks. If LaTeX macros are included in those striked out or underlined
       passages, the latex run will most likely fail. The source of most prob&#8208;
       lems lies in &quot;wdiff&quot; tearing apart pairs of braces. Therefore &quot;texdiff&quot;
       is a perl script that calls &quot;wdiff&quot; internally and fixes &quot;wdiff&quot;&apos;s output
       by re-pairing braces again and handling some commonly used LaTeX macros.

       For texdiff to work, the following LaTeX code must be inserted in the
       preamble of the LaTeX document:

        \usepackage{xcolor} \usepackage{ulem} \usepackage{changebar}
        \newcommand\TLSins[1]{\cbstart{}\textcolor{ins}{\uline{#1}}\cbend{}}
        \newcommand\TLSdel[1]{\cbdelete{}\textcolor{del}{\sout{#1}}}

       Define editing colors &quot;ins&quot; and &quot;del&quot; with existing &quot;xcolor&quot; color names:
        \colorlet{ins}{blue} \colorlet{del}{red}

       Or from scratch:
        \definecolor{ins}{rgb}{0, 0.5, 0}

       These macros are NOT automatically interted at \begin{document} like the
       original scripts did (see the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS section below), because
       this will not work on files of a multi-file document (those included by
       \include or \input).  Furthermore, if you insert the macros manually, you
       can tune them as you like, i. e. change text color or position of change&#8208;
       bars. Have a look at the documentation of the ulem and changebar packages
       on how to do this!

OPTIONS
       --nofloats, -n
           If given, skips contents of figure environments, but does show inser&#8208;
           tions and deletions in the caption commands. This is done to avoid
           complex messups in subfloat or complex figure environments.

       --debug, -d
           Turns on debugging. Temporary files that contain numbered braces are
           kept and a raw difference file is written as output file name
           appended with &apos;-wdiff.tex&apos;. In addition, several regular expression
           diagnostics are printed. Warning: produces a lot of output.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       *   Version 0.4, by CG, 2009/09/15. Added use of GetOpt to take an
           optional parameter to skip float (e.g., figure or table) contents.
           Added an optional debug mode. Embedded POD documentation. Fixed prob&#8208;
           lem with insertion and deletions appearing in the middle of section&#8208;
           ing commands by throwing off LaTeX.

       *   Version 0.3, modified by Cengiz Gunay &lt;cengique@users.sf.net&gt;,
           2009/06/30. Added some Latex commands that should be excluded and
           fixed handling of &apos;\%&apos; characters.

       *   Version 0.2, is a perl implementation of TeXdiff by Mark Doll &lt;mark&#8208;
           doll@gmx.net&gt;, 2006/08/09. It was derived from the original bash and
           perl scripts created by Robert Maron &lt;robmar@mimuw.edu.pl&gt;, available
           at http://www.robmar.net/TexDiff/. This version of texdiff is avail&#8208;
           able at http://mark.doll.name/texdiff/.
