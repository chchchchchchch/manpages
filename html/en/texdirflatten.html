NAME
       texdirflatten - Collects all components of a (La)TeX file in a single
       output directory -- i.e., flattens its hierarchy.

SYNOPSIS
       texdirflatten -f input.tex [-o outputdir]

DESCRIPTION
       It parses the source file, following its included children (La)TeX files
       recursively, to collect together its components, such as graphics and
       BiBTeX bibliography files in different directories.

OPTIONS
       -f input.tex
           Specifies input (La)TeX file.

       -o outputdir
           Directory to collect all files. texdirflatten will copy each source
           file, graphics and bibliography file to this directory. It will be
           created if it is unexistent. If unspecified, it defaults to &quot;flat/&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       The following example scans &quot;manuscript.tex&quot; in the current directory and
       gathers it and all its components in the &quot;submit_01/&quot; directory:

        $ texdirflatten -f manuscript.tex -o submit_01
