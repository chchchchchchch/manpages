DESCRIPTION
       texindy is the LaTeX-specific command of xindy, the flexible indexing
       system. It takes a raw index as input, and produces a merged, sorted and
       tagged index. Merging, sorting, and tagging is controlled by xindy
       modules, with a convenient set already preloaded.

       Files with the raw index are passed as arguments. If no arguments are
       passed, the raw index will be read from standard input.

       A good introductionary description of texindy appears in the indexing
       chapter of the LaTeX Companion (2nd ed.)

       If you want to produce an index for LaTeX documents with special index
       markup, the command xindy(1) is probably more of interest for you.

       texindy is an approach to merge support for the make-rules framework, own
       xindy modules (e.g., for special LaTeX commands in the index), and a
       reasonable level of MakeIndex compatibility. There are other older
       approaches, eventually they will get a description on the xindy Web Site,
       http://www.xindy.org/.

OPTIONS
       &quot;--version&quot; / -V
           output version numbers of all relevant components and exit.

       &quot;--help&quot; / -h / -?
           output usage message with options explanation.

       &quot;--quiet&quot; / -q
           Don&apos;t output progress messages. Output only error messages.

       &quot;--verbose&quot; / -v
           Output verbose progress messages.

       &quot;--debug&quot; magic / -d magic
           Output debug messages, this option may be specified multiple times.
           magic determines what is output:

            magic          remark
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            script         internal progress messages of driver scripts
            keep_tmpfiles  don&apos;t discard temporary files
            markup         output markup trace, as explained in xindy manual
            level=n        log level, n is 0 (default), 1, 2, or 3

       &quot;--out-file&quot; outfile.ind / -o outfile.ind
           Output index to file outfile.ind. If this option is not passed, the
           name of the output file is the base name of the first argument and
           the file extension ind. If the raw index is read from standard input,
           this option is mandatory.

       &quot;--log-file&quot; log.ilg / -t log.ilg
           Output log messages to file log.ilg. These log messages are
           independent from the progress messages that you can influence with
           &quot;--debug&quot; or &quot;--verbose&quot;.

       &quot;--language&quot; lang / -L lang
           The index is sorted according to the rules of language lang. These
           rules are encoded in a xindy module created by make-rules.

           If no input encoding is specified via &quot;--codepage&quot;, a xindy module
           for that language is searched with a latin, a cp, an iso, or ascii
           encoding, in that order.

       &quot;--codepage&quot; enc / B &lt;-C&gt; enc
           The raw input is in input encoding enc. This information is used to
           select the correct xindy sort module and also the inputenc target
           encoding for &quot;latex&quot; input markup.

           When &quot;omega&quot; input markup is used, &quot;utf8&quot; is always used as the sort
           codepage and no inputenc module is loaded. Then this option is
           ignored.

       &quot;--module&quot; module / -M module
           Load the xindy module module.xdy. This option may be specified
           multiple times. The modules are searched in the xindy search path
           that can be changed with the environment variable &quot;XINDY_SEARCHPATH&quot;.

       &quot;--input-markup&quot; input / -I input
           Specifies the input markup of the raw index. Supported values for
           input are &quot;latex&quot; and &quot;omega&quot;.

           &quot;latex&quot; input markup is the one that is emitted by default from the
           LaTeX kernel, or by the &quot;index&quot; macro package of David Jones.
           ^^-notation of single byte characters is supported. Usage of LaTeX&apos;s
           inputenc package is assumed as well.

           &quot;omega&quot; input markup is like &quot;latex&quot; input markup, but with Omega&apos;s
           ^^-notation as encoding for non-ASCII characters. LaTeX inputenc
           encoding is not used then, and &quot;utf8&quot; is enforced to be the codepage
           for sorting.

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES / CODEPAGES
       The following languages are supported:

       Latin scripts

        albanian      gypsy             portuguese
        croatian      hausa             romanian
        czech         hungarian         russian-iso
        danish        icelandic         slovak-small
        english       italian           slovak-large
        esperanto     kurdish-bedirxan  slovenian
        estonian      kurdish-turkish   spanish-modern

        german-duden  norwegian         vietnamese
        greek-iso     polish

       German recognizes two different sorting schemes to handle umlauts:
       normally, &quot;ae&quot; is sorted like &quot;ae&quot;, but in phone books or dictionaries,
       it is sorted like &quot;a&quot;. The first scheme is known as DIN order, the second
       as Duden order.

       &quot;*-iso&quot; language names assume that the raw index entries are in ISO
       8859-9 encoding.

       &quot;gypsy&quot; is a northern Russian dialect.

       Cyrillic scripts

        belarusian    mongolian         serbian
        bulgarian     russian           ukrainian
        macedonian

       Other scripts

        greek         klingon

       Available Codepages

       This is not yet written. You can look them up in your xindy distribution,
       in the modules/lang/language/ directory (where language is your
       language). They are named variant-codepage-lang.xdy, where variant- is
       most often empty (for german, it&apos;s &quot;din5007&quot; and &quot;duden&quot;; for spanish,
       it&apos;s &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot;, etc.)

        &lt; Describe available codepages for each language &gt;

        &lt; Describe relevance of codepages (as internal representation) for
          LaTeX inputenc &gt;

TEXINDY STANDARD MODULES
       There is a set of texindy standard modules that help to process LaTeX
       index files. Some of them are automatically loaded. Some of them are
       loaded by default, this can be turned off with a texindy option. Others
       may be specified as &quot;--module&quot; argument to achieve a specific effect.

       Sorting

        word-order      Default   A space comes before any letter in the
                                  alphabet: ``index style&apos;&apos; is listed before
                                  ``indexing&apos;&apos;. Turn it off with option -l.
        letter-order    Add-on    Spaces are ignored: ``index style&apos;&apos;
                                  is sorted after ``indexing&apos;&apos;.
        keep-blanks     Add-on    Leading and trailing white space (blanks
                                  and tabs) are not ignored; intermediate
                                  white space is not changed.
        ignore-hyphen   Add-on    Hyphens are ignored:
                                  ``ad-hoc&apos;&apos; is sorted as ``adhoc&apos;&apos;.
        ignore-punctuation Add-on All kinds of punctuation characters are
                                  ignored: hyphens, periods, commas, slashes,
                                  parentheses, and so on.
        numeric-sort    Auto      Numbers are sorted numerically, not like
                                  characters: ``V64&apos;&apos; appears before ``V128&apos;&apos;.

       Page Numbers

        page-ranges     Default   Appearances on more than two consecutive
                                  pages are listed as a range: ``1--4&apos;&apos;.
                                  Turn it off with option -r.
        ff-ranges       Add-on    Uses implicit ``ff&apos;&apos; notation for ranges
                                  of three pages, and explicit ranges
                                  thereafter: 2f, 2ff, 2--6.
        ff-ranges-only  Add-on    Uses only implicit ranges: 2f, 2ff.
        book-order      Add-on    Sorts page numbers with common book numbering
                                  scheme correctly -- Roman numerals first, then
                                  Arabic numbers, then others: i, 1, A.

       Markup and Layout

        tex             Auto      Handles basic TeX conventions.
        latex-loc-fmts  Auto      Provides LaTeX formatting commands
                                  for page number encapsulation.
        latex           Auto      Handles LaTeX conventions, both in raw
                                  index entries and output markup; implies
                                  tex.
        makeindex       Auto      Emulates the default MakeIndex input syntax
                                  and quoting behavior.
        latin-lettergroups Auto   Layout contains a single Latin letter
                                  above each group of words starting with the
                                  same letter.
        german-sty      Add-on    Handles umlaut markup of babel&apos;s german
                                  and ngerman options.

COMPATIBILITY TO MAKEINDEX
       xindy does not claim to be completely compatible with MakeIndex, that
       would prevent some of its enhancements. That said, we strive to deliver
       as much compatibility as possible. The most important incompatibilities
       are

       &#183;   For raw index entries in LaTeX syntax, &quot;\index{aaa|bbb}&quot; is
           interpreted differently. For MakeIndex &quot;bbb&quot; is markup that is output
           as a LaTeX tag for this page number. For xindy, this is a location
           attribute, an abstract identifier that will be later associated with
           markup that should be output for that attribute.

           For straight-forward usage, when &quot;bbb&quot; is &quot;textbf&quot; or similar, we
           supply location attribute definitions that mimic MakeIndex&apos;s
           behaviour.

           For more complex usage, when &quot;bbb&quot; is not an identifier, no such
           compatibility definitions exist and may also not been created with
           current xindy. In particular, this means that by default the LaTeX
           package &quot;hyperref&quot; will create raw index files that cannot be
           processed with xindy. This is not a bug, this is the unfortunate
           result of an intented incompatibility. It is currently not possible
           to get both hyperref&apos;s index links and use xindy.

           A similar situation is reported to exist for the &quot;memoir&quot; LaTeX
           class.

           Programmers who know Common Lisp and Lex and want to work on a remedy
           should please contact the author.

       &#183;   The MakeIndex compatibility definitions support only the default raw
           index syntax and markup definition. It is not possible to configure
           raw index parsing or use a MakeIndex style file to describe output
           markup.

ENVIRONMENT
       &quot;TEXINDY_AUTO_MODULE&quot;
           This is the name of the xindy module that loads all auto-loaded
           modules. The default is &quot;texindy&quot;.
