NAME
       texlinks - maintain symbolic links from format to engine

SYNOPSIS
       texlinks [ OPTIONS... ]  DIRECTORIES...

DESCRIPTION
       texlinks  is  used  to  create or recreate symbolic links from formats to
       engines according to the information in fmtutil.cnf or a  file  specified
       with --cnffile.

       DIRECTORIES  is  an optional list of directories in which to operate.  If

       --multiplatform or -m
              operate  in  all  platform-specific  directories (default: operate
              only in the directory for this platform)

       --silent or -s
              silently skip over existing scripts/binaries instead of printing a
              warning

       --unlink or -u
              Unlink previously created symlinks
