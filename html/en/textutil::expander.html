DESCRIPTION
       The  Tcl  subst  command is often used to support a kind of template pro&#8208;
       cessing. Given a string with embedded variables or function calls,  subst
       will  interpolate  the  variable  and  function values, returning the new
       string:

                  % set greeting &quot;Howdy&quot;
                  Howdy
                  % proc place {} {return &quot;World&quot;}
                  % subst {$greeting, [place]!}
                  Howdy, World!
                  %


       By defining a suitable set of Tcl commands, subst can be used  to  imple&#8208;
       ment a markup language similar to HTML.

       The  subst command is efficient, but it has three drawbacks for this kind
       of template processing:

       &#183;      There&apos;s no way to identify and process the plain text between  two
              embedded  Tcl  commands;  that  makes it difficult to handle plain
              text in a context-sensitive way.

       &#183;      Embedded commands are necessarily bracketed by [ and ]; it&apos;s  con&#8208;
              venient  to be able to choose different brackets in special cases.
              Someone producing web pages that include a large quantity  of  Tcl
              code examples might easily prefer to use &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; as the embedded
              code delimiters instead.

       &#183;      There&apos;s no easy way to handle incremental input, as one might wish
              to do when reading data from a socket.

       At  present,  expander  solves the first two problems; eventually it will
       solve the third problem as well.

       The following section describes the command API to the expander; this  is
       followed by the tutorial sections, see TUTORIAL.

EXPANDER API
       The  textutil::expander  package  provides  only  one  command, described
       below. The rest of the section is taken by a description of  the  methods
       for the expander objects created by this command.

       ::textutil::expander expanderName
              The  command  creates a new expander object with an associated Tcl
              command whose name is expanderName. This command may  be  used  to
              invoke various operations on the graph. If the expanderName is not
              fully qualified it is  interpreted  as  relative  to  the  current
              namespace.  The command has the following general form:


              expanderName option ?arg arg ...?


              Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       The following commands are possible for expander objects:

       expanderName cappend text
              Appends  a string to the output in the current context.  This com&#8208;
              mand should rarely be used by macros or application code.

       expanderName cget varname
              Retrieves the value of variable varname, defined  in  the  current
              context.

       expanderName cis cname
              Determines  whether  or  not  the  name  of the current context is
              cname.

       expanderName cname
              Returns the name of the current context.

       expanderName cpop cname
              Pops a context from the context stack, returning  all  accumulated
              output  in  that  context.  The context must be named cname, or an
              error results.

       expanderName ctopandclear
              Returns the output currently captured in the topmost  context  and
              clears  that buffer. This is similar to a combination of cpop fol&#8208;
              lowed by cpush, except that internal state (brackets) is preserved
              here.

       expanderName cpush cname
              Pushes  a context named cname onto the context stack.  The context
              must be popped by cpop before expansion ends or an error results.

       expanderName cset varname value
              Sets variable varname to value in the current context.

       expanderName cvar varname
              Retrieves the internal variable name of context variable  varname;
              this allows the variable to be passed to commands like lappend.

       expanderName errmode newErrmode
              Sets  the  macro  expansion  error  mode to one of nothing, macro,
              error, or fail; the default value is fail.  The  value  determines
              what the expander does if an error is detected during expansion of
              a macro.

              fail   The error propagates normally and can be caught or  ignored
                     by the application.

              error  The macro expands into a detailed error message, and expan&#8208;
                     sion continues.

              macro  The macro expands to itself; that is, it is passed along to
                     the output unchanged.

              nothing
                     The  macro  expands to the empty string, and is effectively
                     ignored.


       expanderName evalcmd ?newEvalCmd?
              Returns the current evaluation command, which defaults to  uplevel
              #0.   If  specified,  newEvalCmd  will be saved for future use and
              then returned; it must be a Tcl command expecting  one  additional
              argument: the macro to evaluate.

       expanderName expand string ?brackets?
              Expands  the  input  string,  replacing embedded macros with their
              expanded values, and returns the expanded string.

              If brackets is given, it must be a list of two strings; the  items
              will  be  used  as  the  left  and  right  macro expansion bracket
              sequences for this expansion only.

       expanderName lb ?newbracket?
              Returns the current value of the  left  macro  expansion  bracket;
              this is for use as or within a macro, when the bracket needs to be
              included in the output  text.   If  newbracket  is  specified,  it
              becomes the new bracket, and is returned.

       expanderName rb ?newbracket?
              Returns  the  current  value of the right macro expansion bracket;
              this is for use as or within a macro, when the bracket needs to be
              included  in  the  output  text.   If  newbracket is specified, it
              becomes the new bracket, and is returned.

       expanderName reset
              Resets all expander settings to  their  initial  values.   Unusual
              results are likely if this command is called from within a call to
              expand.

       expanderName setbrackets lbrack rbrack
              Sets the left and right macro expansion brackets.  This command is
              for use as or within a macro, or to permanently change the bracket
              definitions.  By default, the brackets are [ and ], but  any  non-
              empty  string  can  be  used; for example, &lt; and &gt; or (* and *) or
              even Hello, and World!.

       expanderName textcmd ?newTextCmd?
              Returns the current  command  for  processing  plain  text,  which
              defaults to the empty string, meaning identity. If specified, new&#8208;
              TextCmd will be saved for future use and then returned; it must be
              a  Tcl  command  expecting  one  additional  argument: the text to
              process. The expander object will this command for all plain  text
              it  encounters,  giving  the  user  of  the  object the ability to
              process all plain text in some standard way before writing  it  to
              the  output.  The object expects that the command returns the pro&#8208;
              cessed plain text.

              Note that the combination of &quot;textcmd plaintext&quot;  is  run  through
              the evalcmd for the actual evaluation. In other words, the textcmd
              is treated as a special macro  implicitly  surrounding  all  plain
              text in the template.

       expanderName where
              Returns  a  three-element  list  containing  the current character
              position, line, and column the expander is at in the processing of
              the current input string.

TUTORIAL
   BASICS
       To begin, create an expander object:

                  % package require expander
                  1.2
                  % ::expander::expander myexp
                  ::myexp
                  %


       The  created ::myexp object can be used to expand text strings containing
       embedded Tcl commands.  By default, embedded commands  are  delimited  by
       square brackets.  Note that expander doesn&apos;t attempt to interpolate vari&#8208;
       ables, since variables can be referenced by embedded commands:

                  % set greeting &quot;Howdy&quot;
                  Howdy
                  % proc place {} {return &quot;World&quot;}
                  % ::myexp expand {[set greeting], [place]!}
                  Howdy, World!
                  %


   EMBEDDING MACROS
       An expander macro is simply a Tcl script embedded within a  text  string.
       Expander evaluates the script in the global context, and replaces it with
       its result string.  For example,

                  % set greetings {Howdy Hi &quot;What&apos;s up&quot;}
                  Howdy Hi &quot;What&apos;s up&quot;
                  % ::myexp expand {There are many ways to say &quot;Hello, World!&quot;:
                  [set result {}
                  foreach greeting $greetings {
                append result &quot;$greeting, World!\\n&quot;
                  }
                  set result]
                  And that&apos;s just a small sample!}
                  There are many ways to say &quot;Hello, World!&quot;:
                  Howdy, World!
                  Hi, World!
                  What&apos;s up, World!

                  And that&apos;s just a small sample!
                  %


   WRITING MACRO COMMANDS
       More typically, macro commands are used to create a markup  language.   A
       macro  command  is just a Tcl command that returns an output string.  For
       example, expand can be used to implement a generic document  markup  lan&#8208;
       guage that can be retargeted to HTML or any other output format:

                  % proc bold {} {return &quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot;}
                  % proc /bold {} {return &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;}
                  % ::myexp expand {Some of this text is in [bold]boldface[/bold]}
                  Some of this text is in &lt;b&gt;boldface&lt;/b&gt;
                  %


       The  above  definitions of bold and /bold returns HTML, but such commands
       can be as complicated as needed; they could, for example, decide what  to
       return based on the desired output format.

   CHANGING THE EXPANSION BRACKETS
       By default, embedded macros are enclosed in square brackets, [ and ].  If
       square brackets need to be included in the output, the input can  contain
       the  lb and rb commands.  Alternatively, or if square brackets are objec&#8208;
       tionable for some other reason,  the  macro  expansion  brackets  can  be
       changed to any pair of non-empty strings.

       The  setbrackets  command changes the brackets permanently.  For example,
       you can write pseudo-html by change them to &lt; and &gt;:

                  % ::myexp setbrackets &lt; &gt;
                  % ::myexp expand {&lt;bold&gt;This is boldface&lt;/bold&gt;}
                  &lt;b&gt;This is boldface&lt;/b&gt;


       Alternatively, you can change the expansion brackets temporarily by pass&#8208;
       ing the desired brackets to the expand command:

                  % ::myexp setbrackets &quot;\\[&quot; &quot;\\]&quot;
                  % ::myexp expand {&lt;bold&gt;This is boldface&lt;/bold&gt;} {&lt; &gt;}
                  &lt;b&gt;This is boldface&lt;/b&gt;
                  %


   CUSTOMIZED MACRO EXPANSION
       By  default,  macros  are  evaluated using the Tcl uplevel #0 command, so
       that the embedded code executes in the global context.   The  application
       can provide a different evaluation command using evalcmd; this allows the
       application to use a safe interpreter, for example, or even to  evaluated
       something  other than Tcl code.  There is one caveat: to be recognized as
       valid, a macro must return 1 when passed to Tcl&apos;s  &quot;info  complete&quot;  com&#8208;
       mand.

       For  example,  the following code &quot;evaluates&quot; each macro by returning the
       macro text itself.

                  proc identity {macro} {return $macro}
                  ::myexp evalcmd identity
&#12;   USING THE CONTEXT STACK
       Often it&apos;s desirable to define a pair of macros which operate in some way
       on  the  plain  text  between  them.  Consider a set of macros for adding
       footnotes to a web page: one could have implement something like this:

                  Dr. Pangloss, however, thinks that this is the best of all
                  possible worlds.[footnote &quot;See Candide, by Voltaire&quot;]


       The footnote macro would, presumably, assign a number  to  this  footnote
       and  save  the  text to be formatted later on.  However, this solution is
       ugly if the footnote text is long or should  contain  additional  markup.
       Consider the following instead:

                  Dr. Pangloss, however, thinks that this is the best of all
                  possible worlds.[footnote]See [bookTitle &quot;Candide&quot;], by
                  [authorsName &quot;Voltaire&quot;], for more information.[/footnote]


       Here  the  footnote  text  is  contained  between  footnote and /footnote
       macros, continues onto a second line, and contains several macros of  its
       own.   This is both clearer and more flexible; however, with the features
       presented so far there&apos;s no easy way to do it.  That&apos;s the purpose of the
       context stack.

       All macro expansion takes place in a particular context.  Here, the foot&#8208;
       note macro pushes a new  context  onto  the  context  stack.   Then,  all
       expanded text gets placed in that new context.  /footnote retrieves it by
       popping the context.  Here&apos;s  a  skeleton  implementation  of  these  two
       macros:

                  proc footnote {} {
                      ::myexp cpush footnote
                  }

                  proc /footnote {} {
                      set footnoteText [::myexp cpop footnote]

                      # Save the footnote text, and return an appropriate footnote
                      # number and link.
                  }


       The  cpush  command  pushes a new context onto the stack; the argument is
       the context&apos;s name.  It can be any string, but  would  typically  be  the
       name  of  the macro itself.  Then, cpop verifies that the current context
       has the expected name, pops it off of the stack, and returns the  accumu&#8208;
       lated text.

       Expand  provides  several other tools related to the context stack.  Sup&#8208;
       pose the first macro in a context pair takes arguments or computes values
       which the second macro in the pair needs.  After calling cpush, the first
       macro can define one or more context  variables;  the  second  macro  can
       retrieve their values any time before calling cpop.  For example, suppose
       the document must specify the footnote number explicitly:

                  proc footnote {footnoteNumber} {
                      ::myexp cpush footnote
                      ::myexp csave num $footnoteNumber
                      # Return an appropriate link
                  }

                  proc /footnote {} {
                      set footnoteNumber [::myexp cget num]
                      set footnoteText [::myexp cpop footnote]

                      # Save the footnote text and its footnoteNumber for future
                      # output.
                  }


       At times, it might be desirable to define  macros  that  are  valid  only
       within a particular context pair; such macros should verify that they are
       only called within the correct context using either cis or cname.

HISTORY
       expander was written by William H. Duquette; it is a repackaging  of  the
       central algorithm of the expand macro processing tool.
