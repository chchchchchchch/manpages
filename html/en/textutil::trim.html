DESCRIPTION
       The  package  textutil::trim  provides  commands  that trim strings using
       arbitrary regular expressions.

       The complete set of procedures is described below.

       ::textutil::trim::trim string ?regexp?
              Remove in string any leading and trailing substring  according  to
              the  regular  expression  regexp  and  return  the result as a new
              string.  This is done for all lines in the  string,  that  is  any
              substring between 2 newline chars, or between the beginning of the
              string and a newline, or between a newline  and  the  end  of  the
              string,  or,  if the string contain no newline, between the begin&#8208;
              ning and the end of the string.   The  regular  expression  regexp
              defaults to &quot;[ \\t]+&quot;.

       ::textutil::trim::trimleft string ?regexp?
              Remove  in  string  any leading substring according to the regular
              expression regexp and return the result  as  a  new  string.  This
              apply  on  any line in the string, that is any substring between 2
              newline chars, or between the beginning of the string and  a  new&#8208;
              line,  or  between a newline and the end of the string, or, if the
              string contain no newline, between the beginning and  the  end  of
              the string.  The regular expression regexp defaults to &quot;[ \\t]+&quot;.

       ::textutil::trim::trimright string ?regexp?
              Remove  in  string any trailing substring according to the regular
              expression regexp and return the result  as  a  new  string.  This
              apply  on  any line in the string, that is any substring between 2
              newline chars, or between the beginning of the string and  a  new&#8208;
              line,  or  between a newline and the end of the string, or, if the
              string contain no newline, between the beginning and  the  end  of
              the string.  The regular expression regexp defaults to &quot;[ \\t]+&quot;.

       ::textutil::trim::trimPrefix string prefix
              Removes  the  prefix  from the beginning of string and returns the
              result. The string is left unchanged if it doesn&apos;t have prefix  at
              its beginning.

       ::textutil::trim::trimEmptyHeading string
              Looks  for  empty lines (including lines consisting of only white&#8208;
              space) at the beginning of the string and removes it. The modified
              string is returned as the result of the command.
