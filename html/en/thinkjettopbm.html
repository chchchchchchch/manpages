NAME
       thinkjettopbm - convert HP ThinkJet printer commands file to PBM

SYNOPSIS
       thinkjettopbm [-d] [thinkjet_file]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads   HP   ThinkJet  printer  commands  from  the  standard  input,  or
       thinkjet_file if specified, and writes a PBM image to the  standard  out&#8208;
       put.  Text and non-graphics command sequences are silently ignored.

       The  -d option turns on debugging messages which are written to the stan&#8208;
       dard error stream.


BUGS
       Handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command sequences, but enough  to
       convert screen images from older HP test equipment.


SEE ALSO
       pbm(5), pjtoppm(1)
