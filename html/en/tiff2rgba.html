TIFF2RGBA(1)                                                        TIFF2RGBA(1)



NAME
       tiff2rgba - convert a TIFF image to RGBA color space

SYNOPSIS
       tiff2rgba [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Tiff2rgba converts a wide variety of TIFF images into an RGBA TIFF image.
       This includes the ability to translate different color spaces and  photo&#8208;
       metric interpretation into RGBA, support for alpha blending, and transla&#8208;
       tion of many different bit depths into a 32bit RGBA image.

       Internally this program  is  implemented  using  the  TIFFReadRGBAImage()
       function,  and  it  suffers any limitations of that image.  This includes
       limited support for &gt; 8 BitsPerSample images, and flaws  with  some  eso&#8208;
       teric  combinations  of  BitsPerSample, photometric interpretation, block
       organization and planar configuration.

       The generated images are stripped images  with  four  samples  per  pixel
       (red, green, blue and alpha) or if the -n flag is used, three samples per
       pixel (red, green, and blue).  The resulting  images  are  always  planar
       configuration  contiguous.   For  this  reason,  this program is a useful
       utility for transform exotic TIFF files into a form ingestible by  almost
       any TIFF supporting software.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify  a  compression  scheme to use when writing image data: -c
              none for no compression (the default), -c packbits for  the  Pack&#8208;
              Bits  compression  algorithm,  -c  zip for the Deflate compression
              algorithm, -c jpeg for the JPEG compression algorithm, and -c  lzw
              for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch.

       -r     Write  data  with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
              the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip is approx&#8208;
              imately 8 kilobytes.

       -b     Process  the  image one block (strip/tile) at a time instead of by
              reading the whole image into memory at once.  This may  be  neces&#8208;
              sary for very large images on systems with limited RAM.

       -n     Drop  the  alpha  component from the output file, producing a pure
              RGB file.  Currently this does not work if the -b flag is also  in
              effect.
