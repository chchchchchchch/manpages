TIFFDUMP(1)                                                          TIFFDUMP(1)



NAME
       tiffdump - print verbatim information about TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffdump [ options ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiffdump  displays  directory information from files created according to
       the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0.  The header of  each  TIFF  file
       (magic  number,  version,  and first directory offset) is displayed, fol&#8208;
       lowed by the tag contents of each directory in the file.  For  each  tag,
       the name, data type, count, and value(s) is displayed.  When the symbolic
       name for a tag or data type is known, the symbolic name is displayed fol&#8208;
       lowed by it&apos;s numeric (decimal) value.  Tag values are displayed enclosed
       in ``&lt;&gt;&apos;&apos; characters immediately preceded  by  the  value  of  the  count
       field.  For example, an ImageWidth tag might be displayed as ``ImageWidth
       (256) SHORT (3) 1&lt;800&gt;&apos;&apos;.

       tiffdump is particularly useful for investigating the  contents  of  TIFF
       files that libtiff does not understand.

OPTIONS
       -h     Force  numeric  data  to be printed in hexadecimal rather than the
              default decimal.

       -m items
              Change the number of indirect data  items  that  are  printed.  By
              default, this will be 24.

       -o offset
              Dump the contents of the IFD at the a particular file offset.  The
              file offset may be specified using the usual C-style syntax;  i.e.
              a leading ``0x&apos;&apos; for hexadecimal and a leading ``0&apos;&apos; for octal.
