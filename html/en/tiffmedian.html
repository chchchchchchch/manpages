TIFFMEDIAN(1)                                                      TIFFMEDIAN(1)



NAME
       tiffmedian - apply the median cut algorithm to data in a TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       tiffmedian [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       tiffmedian  applies the median cut algorithm to an RGB image in input.tif
       to generate a palette image that is written to output.tif.  The generated
       colormap  has,  by  default, 256 entries.  The image data is quantized by
       mapping each pixel to the closest color values in the colormap.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify the compression to use for  data  written  to  the  output
              file:  none for no compression, packbits for PackBits compression,
              lzw for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression, and zip for  Deflate  com&#8208;
              pression.   By  default tiffmedian will compress data according to
              the value of the Compression tag found in the source file.

              LZW compression can be specified together with a predictor  value.
              A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline of the output image to
              undergo horizontal differencing before it is encoded; a value of 1
              forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.  LZW-spe&#8208;
              cific options are specified by appending a ``:&apos;&apos;-separated list to
              the  ``lzw&apos;&apos; option; e.g.  -c lzw:2 for LZW compression with hori&#8208;
              zontal differencing.

       -C     Specify the number of entries to use in  the  generated  colormap.
              By default all 256 entries/colors are used.

       -f     Apply Floyd-Steinberg dithering before selecting a colormap entry.

       -r     Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data writ&#8208;
              ten to the output file.  By default, tiffmedian  attempts  to  set
              the  rows/strip  that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a
              strip.

NOTES
       This program is derived from Paul Heckbert&apos;s median program.
