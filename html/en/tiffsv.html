TIFFSV(1)                                                              TIFFSV(1)



NAME
       tiffsv  -  save  an  image  from  the framebuffer in a TIFF file (Silicon
       Graphics version)

SYNOPSIS
       tiffsv [ options ] output.tif [ x1 x2 y1 y2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       tiffsv saves all or part of the framebuffer in a file using the Tag Image
       File Format, Revision 6.0.  By default, the image is saved with data sam&#8208;
       ples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed  with  the  Lempel-Ziv  &amp;
       Welch algorithm (Compression=5), and with each strip no more than 8 kilo&#8208;
       bytes.  These characteristics can be overridden, or explicitly  specified
       with the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -b     Save  the  image  as  a greyscale image as if it were processed by
              tiff2bw(1).  This option is included for  compatibility  with  the
              standard scrsave(6D) program.

       -c     Specify  the  compression  to  use  for data written to the output
              file: none for no compression, packbits for PackBits  compression,
              jpeg  for  baseline JPEG compression, zip for Deflate compression,
              and lzw for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression (default).

              LZW compression can be specified together with a predictor  value.
              A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline of the output image to
              undergo horizontal differencing before it is encoded; a value of 1
              forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.  LZW-spe&#8208;
              cific options are specified by appending a ``:&apos;&apos;-separated list to
              the  ``lzw&apos;&apos; option; e.g.  -c lzw:2 for LZW compression with hori&#8208;
              zontal differencing.

       -p     Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data.  By
              default,  tiffsv  will  create  a  new  file with the data samples
              packed contiguously.  Specifying -p contig will force data  to  be
              written  with multi-sample data packed together, while -p separate
              will force samples to be written in separate planes.

       -r     Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data writ&#8208;
              ten  to  the  output file.  By default, tiffsv attempts to set the
              rows/strip that no more than 8  kilobytes  of  data  appear  in  a
              strip.

NOTE
       Except  for  the  use of TIFF, this program is equivalent to the standard
       scrsave program.  This means, for example, that you can use  it  in  con&#8208;
       junction  with the standard icut program simply by creating a link called
       scrsave, or by creating a shell script called scrsave that invokes tiffgt
       with the appropriate options.

BUGS
       If  data  are  saved  compressed and in separate planes, then the rows in
       each  strip  is  silently  set  to  one  to  avoid  limitations  in   the
       libtiff(3TIFF) library.
