tifftopnm(1)                                                        tifftopnm(1)



NAME
       tifftopnm - convert a TIFF file into a portable anymap


SYNOPSIS
       tifftopnm   [-alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]   [-headerdump]  [-respectfil&#8208;
       lorder] [tiff-filename]

       You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.  You may use
       two  hyphens  instead  of one in options.  You may separate an option and
       its value either by an equals sign or white space.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a TIFF file as input.  Produces a portable anymap as  output.   The
       type  of  the  output  file  depends  on the input file - if it&apos;s black &amp;
       white, generates a pbm file; if it&apos;s grayscale,  generates  a  pgm  file;
       otherwise, a ppm file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

       This  program  cannot  read  every possible TIFF file -- there are myriad
       variations of the TIFF format.  However, it  does  understand  monochrome
       and  gray  scale,  RGB,  RGBA  (red/green/blue  with alpha channel), CMYK
       (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color palette  TIFF
       files.   An  RGB file can have either single plane (interleaved) color or
       multiple plane format.  The  program  reads  1-8  and  16  bit-per-sample
       input,  the  latter  in  either  bigendian or littlendian encoding.  Tiff
       directory information may also be either bigendian or littendian.

       One reason this program isn&apos;t as general as TIFF programs  often  are  is
       that  it does not use the TIFFRGBAImageGet() function of the TIFF library
       to read TIFF files.  Rather, it uses  the  more  primitive  TIFFReadScan&#8208;
       Line() function and decodes it itself.

       There  is  no  fundamental  reason that this program could not read other
       kinds of TIFF files; the existing limitations are mainly because  no  one
       has asked for more.

       The  PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except that if the
       Tiff input is colormapped (which implies a maxval of 65535) the PNM  out&#8208;
       put  has  a  maxval  of 255.  Though this may result in lost information,
       such input images hardly ever actually have more color resolution than  a
       maxval  of  255 provides and people often cannot deal with PNM files that
       have maxval &gt; 255.   By  contrast,  a  non-colormapped  Tiff  image  that
       doesn&apos;t need a maxval &gt; 255 doesn&apos;t have a maxval &gt; 255, so when we see a
       non-colormapped maxval &gt; 255, we take it seriously and produce a matching
       output maxval.

       The  tiff-filename argument names the regular file that contains the Tiff
       image.  If you specify &quot;-&quot; or don&apos;t specify this argument, tfftopnm  uses
       Standard Input. In either case, the file must be seekable.  That means no
       pipe, but any regular file is fine.


OPTIONS
       -alphaout=alpha-filename
              tifftopnm creates a PGM (portable  graymap)  file  containing  the
              alpha  channel  values  in  the  input  image.  If the input image
              doesn&apos;t contain an alpha channel, the alpha-filename file contains
              all  zero  (transparent)  alpha  values.   If  you  don&apos;t  specify
              -alphaout, tifftopnm does not generate an alpha file, and  if  the
              input image has an alpha channel, tifftopnm simply discards it.
&#12;              If  you specify - as the filename, tifftopnm writes the alpha out&#8208;
              put to Standard Output and discards the image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       -respectfillorder
              By default, tifftopnm ignores the  &quot;fillorder&quot;  tag  in  the  TIFF
              input,  which  means  it  may incorrectly interpret the image.  To
              make it follow the spec, use  this  option.   For  a  lengthy  but
              engaging discussion of why tifftopnm works this way and how to use
              the -respectfillorder option, see the note on fillorder below.


       -headerdump
              Dump TIFF file information to stderr.   This  information  may  be
              useful in debugging TIFF file conversion problems.

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.


NOTES
   Fillorder
       There  is  a  piece  of  information in the header of a TIFF image called
       &quot;fillorder.&quot;  The TIFF specification quite clearly states that this value
       tells  the  order in which bits are arranged in a byte in the description
       of the image&apos;s pixels.  There are two options, assuming  that  the  image
       has  a  format  where  more than one pixel can be represented by a single
       byte: 1) the byte is filled from most signficant bit to least  signficant
       bit going left to right in the image; and 2) the opposite.

       However,  there is confusion in the world as to the meaning of fillorder.
       Evidence shows that some people believe it has to do with byte order when
       a single value is represented by two bytes.

       These  people cause TIFF images to be created that, while they use a MSB-
       to-LSB fillorder, have a fillorder tag that says they used LSB-to-MSB.  A
       program  that  properly  interprets a TIFF image will not end up with the
       image that the author intended in this case.

       For a long time,  tifftopnm  did  not  understand  fillorder  itself  and
       assumed  the  fillorder was MSB-to-LSB regardless of the fillorder tag in
       the TIFF header.  And as far as I know, there is no legitimate reason  to
       use  a  fillorder other than MSB-to-LSB.  So users of tifftopnm were hap&#8208;
       pily using those TIFF images that had incorrect fillorder tags.

       So that those users can continue to be happy, tifftopnm  today  continues
       to  ignore  the  fillorder tag unless you tell it not to.  (It does, how&#8208;
       ever, warn you when the fillorder tag does not say  MSB-to-LSB  that  the
       tag is being ignored).

       If  for  some  reason  you have a TIFF image that actually has LSB-to-MSB
       fillorder, and its fillorder tag correctly indicates that, you  must  use
       the -respectfillorder option on tifftopnm to get proper results.

       Examples  of  incorrect  TIFF images are at ftp://weather.noaa.gov.  They
       are apparently created by a program called faxtotiff.
