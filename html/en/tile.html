DESCRIPTION
       The  tile  widgets let you create textured backgrounds.  The texture is a
       Tk image which is tiled over the entire background of the widget.

INTRODUCTION
       With the advent of Tk 4.0, images are now  easy  to  create  and  use  in
       applications.   Images  add interest to applications and they convey more
       information.  But one area where Tk hasn&apos;t taken advantage of  images  is
       using images as textures for widgets.  Since tiling is a standard feature
       of windowing systems, it&apos;s very easy to use images as textures.

       The tile widgets take the standard Tk 4.0 widgets and add tiling configu&#8208;
       ration  options to them.  Textures are specified by the name of the image
       you wish to be tiled across the background of the widget.

EXAMPLE
       To add tiling to a widget, you simply create an image  using  Tk&apos;s  image
       command  and  use the image name as the value for the -tile configuration
       option of the widget.

              image create photo my_texture -file tan_paper.gif
              blt::tile::frame .f -tile my_texture

       The image my_texture is added to the frame.  If my_texture is updated, so
       will the widget background.

              image create photo my_texture -file rain.gif

       The  tile  widget commands reside in the &quot;blt::tile&quot; namespace, so as not
       to collide with the normal Tk widgets.  An easy  way  to  add  tiling  to
       existing  programs  is to import the tile widget commands into the global
       namespace.

              image create photo my_texture -file tan_paper.gif
              namespace import -force blt::tile::*
              frame .f -tile my_texture

       To use one image for all texturing, you can use the &quot;Tile&quot;  option  class
       name to specify the same image for all tile widgets.
&#12;              image create photo my_texture -file tan_paper.gif
              option add *Tile my_texture


OPTIONS
       The following configurations options are added to the widgets. If a -tile
       or -activetile option is specified, it overrides the background color  of
       the widget.

       -activetile image
              Specifies  a  textured  background  to  display when the widget is
              active.  This option is available for the  tilebutton,  tilecheck&#8208;
              button,  tileradiobutton, and tilescrollbar widgets.  Image is the
              name an image created using Tk&apos;s image command.  The background of
              the  widget  is tiled with image.  If image is &quot;&quot;, then the active
              background color is displayed.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -tile image
              Specifies a textured background to display for the widget.   Image
              is  the name an image created using Tk&apos;s image command.  The back&#8208;
              ground of the widget is tiled with image.  If image  is  &quot;&quot;,  then
              the normal background color is displayed.  The default is &quot;&quot;.
