TIMEOUT(1)                        User Commands                       TIMEOUT(1)



NAME
       timeout - run a command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS
       timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
       timeout [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --foreground

              When  not running timeout directly from a shell prompt, allow COM&#8208;
              MAND to read from the TTY and receive TTY signals.  In this  mode,
              children of COMMAND will not be timed out.

       -k, --kill-after=DURATION

              also  send  a  KILL  signal  if COMMAND is still running this long
              after the initial signal was sent.

       -s, --signal=SIGNAL

              specify the signal to be sent on timeout.  SIGNAL may  be  a  name
              like `HUP&apos; or a number.  See `kill -l` for a list of signals

       --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix: `s&apos; for sec&#8208;
       onds (the default), `m&apos; for minutes, `h&apos; for hours or `d&apos; for days.

       If the command times out, then exit with  status  124.   Otherwise,  exit
       with  the  status  of  COMMAND.  If no signal is specified, send the TERM
       signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills any  process  that  does  not
       block  or catch that signal.  For other processes, it may be necessary to
       use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught.
