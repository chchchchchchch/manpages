TIMERADD(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                TIMERADD(3)



NAME
       timeradd, timersub, timercmp, timerclear, timerisset - timeval operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

       void timeradd(struct timeval *a, struct timeval *b,
                     struct timeval *res);

       void timersub(struct timeval *a, struct timeval *b,
                     struct timeval *res);

       void timerclear(struct timeval *tvp);

       int timerisset(struct timeval *tvp);

       int timercmp(struct timeval *a, struct timeval *b, CMP);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       All functions shown above: _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  macros  are  provided  to  operate on timeval structures, defined in
       &lt;sys/time.h&gt; as:

           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };

       timeradd() adds the time values in a and b, and places  the  sum  in  the
       timeval   pointed  to  by  res.   The  result  is  normalized  such  that
       res-&gt;tv_usec has a value in the range 0 to 999,999.

       timersub() subtracts the time value in b from the time value  in  a,  and
       places  the  result in the timeval pointed to by res.  The result is nor&#8208;
       malized such that res-&gt;tv_usec has a value in the range 0 to 999,999.

       timerclear() zeros out the timeval structure pointed to by tvp,  so  that
       it represents the Epoch: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

       timerisset() returns true (nonzero) if either field of the timeval struc&#8208;
       ture pointed to by tvp contains a nonzero value.

       timercmp() compares the timer values in a  and  b  using  the  comparison
       operator  CMP,  and  returns true (nonzero) or false (0) depending on the
       result of the comparison.  Some systems (but  not  Linux/glibc),  have  a
       broken  timercmp()  implementation, in which CMP of &gt;=, &lt;=, and == do not
       work; portable applications can instead use

           !timercmp(..., &lt;)
           !timercmp(..., &gt;)
           !timercmp(..., !=)

RETURN VALUE
       timerisset() and timercmp() return true (nonzero) or false (0).

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
