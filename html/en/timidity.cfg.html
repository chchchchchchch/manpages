timidity.cfg(5)                                                  timidity.cfg(5)



NAME
       timidity.cfg - configure file of TiMidity++

DESCRIPTION
       The  file timidity.cfg describes the runtime environments of timidity(1):
       that are the path of sound font, instruments configurations, etc.
       TiMidity++ looks for the  configuration  file  timidity.cfg  at  startup,
       before  processing any options.  If it can&apos;t be accessed, and the library
       path is changed with a -L option on the command line,  then  the  default
       file will be sought again along the new library path after processing all
       options, unless another configuration file  was  specified  with  the  -c
       option.
       Configuration  files  define  the  mapping of MIDI programs to instrument
       files.  Multiple files may be specified, and  statements  in  later  ones
       will override earlier ones.

VARIABLE
       When  alphanumeric and/or underscore `_&apos; characters continue after dollar
       sign `$&apos;, it is considered that the string is a variable and the configu&#8208;
       ration  file is processed, it is transposed to another string.  The vari&#8208;
       able name can also be written with an inside  parenthesis,  in  order  to
       separate from a following character.

       For example:
       $variable
       ${variable} # same as $variable

       For  the  moment,  the  command which newly defines variables is not pre&#8208;
       pared.  The undefined variable is transposed to null string.
       The variable defined as a regular variable is the next only one.

       $basedir
              Expresses the directory where the configuration file  exists.   By
              the  command  which  mainly  specifies a path, it uses in order to
              specify the relative path from a setting file.
              When a blank may be included in $basedir, it is necessary to  bun&#8208;
              dle with &quot;&quot;.

              For example:
              In /usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg
              dir $basedir/inst # source /usr/local/share/timidity/inst

SYNTAX
       The following statements can be used in a configuration file:

       dir directory [...]
              Adds  directory  to  the  search path in the same manner as the -L
              command line option.
              Archive file are also allowed.

              For example:
              dir /usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip#
              bank 0
              0 bar.pat
              1 baz.pat
              2 zoo.pat

              At first, dir specifies the archive name (followed by `#&apos;) for the
              path  of  patch  files  same  as  directory  name  (in  this case,
              /usr/local/share/timidity/inst/foo.zip).  TiMidity++ recognize the
              path  is  an archive file if the expression has the last character
              `#&apos;, and also read the files contained in this archive  file.   In
              previous example the patch files bar.pat, baz.pat and zoo.pat con&#8208;
              tained in the foo.zip are also installed.

       source file [...]
              Reads another configuration file, then  continues  processing  the
              current one.

       progbase number
              Sets  and  displays the tone number from number to number+128.  If
              progbase 1 are specified, tone numbers that  follow  are  set  and
              displayed as the numbers from 1 to 128.

       bank [MapID1] number
              Selects  the tone bank to modify.  Patch mappings that follow will
              affect this tone bank.  You can indicate specific map as a target,
              by  specifying  any  of  the following to MapID1: gm2, sc55, sc88,
              sc88pro, sc8850, xg and xgsfx64.

       drumset [MapID2] number
              Selects the drum set to modify.  Patch mappings that  follow  will
              affect  this drum set.  You can indicate specific map as a target,
              by specifying any ofthe following to  MapID2:  gm2drum,  sc55drum,
              sc88drum, sc88prodrum, sc8850drum, xgdrum and xgsfx126.

       number file [options]
       number %font file bank prog [key] [options]
       number %sample file [options]
              Specifies that the MIDI program number in the current tone bank or
              drum set should be played using the patch file.  If file is Sound&#8208;
              Font,  the  specific  instrument with bank, prog, and key is taken
              out by the format of number %font.  If file is linear AIFF or  WAV
              sample data, the MIDI program number is specified by the format of
              number %sample.  Options may be any of the following:

              amp=amplification
                     Amplifies the instrument&apos;s volume by amplification percent.
                     If  no value is specified, one will be automatically deter&#8208;
                     mined whenever the instrument is loaded.

              note=note
                     Specifies a fixed MIDI note to use when playing the instru&#8208;
                     ment.  If note is 0, the instrument will be played at what&#8208;
                     ever note the Note On event triggering it has.  For percus&#8208;
                     sion  instruments, if no value is specified in the configu&#8208;
                     ration file, the default in the patch file will be used.

              pan=panning
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s  default  panning.   panning  may  be
                     left,  right,  center,  or an integer between -100 and 100,
                     designating full left and full right respectively.   If  no
                     value  is  specified, the default in the patch file will be
                     used.  Note that panning controls in MIDI files will  over&#8208;
                     ride this value.

              tune=tuning[,...]
                     Adjust  the  instrument&apos;s  root frequency.  tune=1 causes 1
                     half tone higher.  Since a fraction is available  for  tun&#8208;
                     ing,  it  is  possible to do fine tuning such as tune=-0.2.
                     When two or more sample data is  contained,  the  arguments
                     after the second can specify different value respectively.

              rate=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  ADSR  rate.   Each value may be an
                     integer between 0 and 255.  When you set only sustain rate,

                     6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=::60

                     is available.  When you set only attack time fasten,

                     6 GUS/hrpschrd.pat rate=255

                     is available.  When two or more sample data  is  contained,
                     the  arguments after the second can specify different value
                     respectively.

              offset=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s ADSR offset.  Each value  may  be  an
                     integer between 0 and 255.  The format is same as rate=.

              keep={loop|env}
                     By  default,  percussion  instruments  have  their loop and
                     envelope information stripped.  Strangely shaped  envelopes
                     are removed automatically from melodic instruments as well.
                     keep= can be used to prevent  stripping  loop  or  envelope
                     data.   For  example, the Short and Long Whistle percussion
                     instruments (General Midi numbers 71 and 72) need  to  have
                     `keep=loop keep=env&apos; specified in the configuration file.

              strip={loop|env|tail}
                     Force  removal  of  loop  or  envelope information from all
                     patches in the instrument, or strip the tail, i.e. all data
                     after  the loop.  Some third-party instruments have garbage
                     after the loop, as evidenced by a clicking  noise  whenever
                     the  instrument  is played, so adding the strip=tail option
                     will markedly improve sound quality.

              tremolo=sweep_increment:control_ratio:depth[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s tremolo.  Each value may be an  inte&#8208;
                     ger  between  0  and  255.  The format is similar to rate=.
                     sweep_increment is the time until tremolo is started.  con&#8208;
                     trol_ratio  is  the  rate changing amplification.  depth is
                     the depth changing amplification.

              vibrato=sweep_increment:phase_increment:depth[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s vibrato.  Each value may be an  inte&#8208;
                     ger  between  0  and  255.  The format is similar to rate=.
                     sweep_increment is  the  time  until  vibrato  is  started.
                     phase_increment  is  the rate changing frequency.  depth is
                     the depth changing frequency.

              sclnote=note[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s standard note for scale tuning.   For
                     example, sclnote=60 causes the center note C to be standard
                     note for scale tuning.  When two or  more  sample  data  is
                     contained,  the arguments after the second can specify dif&#8208;
                     ferent value respectively.

              scltune=tune[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s scale tuning factor  in  cents.   For
                     example, scltune=50 causes the half tone steps as 50 cents.
                     When two or more sample data is  contained,  the  arguments
                     after the second can specify different value respectively.

              comm=comment
                     Specifies the comment comment.

              modrate=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
              modoffset=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  behavior  of  change of modulation
                     envelope.  The format and values are fundamentally same  as
                     volume  envelope.   Except  for some SoundFonts, even if it
                     specifies only the option, nothing happens.

              envkeyf=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s volume envelope key follow.  Based on
                     note=60,  it  changes envelope time according to note.  The
                     unit is +-cent/key.  For example,  envkeyf=100  means  that
                     the  attack  time  will double when it goes up by 1 octave.
                     The format is similar to rate=.  The parameter of decay and
                     sustain may be preset in some SoundFont.

              envvelf=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  volume  envelope  velocity follow.
                     Based on velocity=64, it changes envelope time according to
                     velocity.   The  unit  is  +-cent/velocity.   For  example,
                     envvelf=100 means that the attack time  will  38  times  at
                     velocity=127.   The  format  is  similar  to rate=.  In the
                     future, the specification of this option may be changed.

              modkeyf=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  modulation  envelope  key  follow.
                     Based  on  note=60,  it  changes envelope time according to
                     note.  The unit is +-cent/key.   For  example,  modkeyf=100
                     means that the attack time will double when it goes up by 1
                     octave.  The format is similar to rate=.  The parameter  of
                     decay and sustain may be preset in some SoundFont.

              modvelf=attack:decay:sustain:release1:release2:release3[,...]
                     Sets  the instrument&apos;s modulation envelope velocity follow.
                     Based on velocity=64, it changes envelope time according to
                     velocity.   The unit is +-cent/velocity.  For example, mod&#8208;
                     velf=100 means that the attack time will 38 times at veloc&#8208;
                     ity=127.   The  format is similar to rate=.  In the future,
                     the specification of this option may be changed.

              trempitch=num[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s depth of changing pitch according  to
                     tremolo.   The effect itself is same as vibrato, it uses to
                     operate in another system.  The unit is +-cent.  The format
                     is similar to rate=.

              tremfc=num[,...]
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  depth of changing cutoff frequency
                     according to tremolo.  It can express the  so-called  glowl
                     effect.  The unit, etc.  are same as trempitch=.

              modpitch=num[,...]
                     Sets  the instrument&apos;s depth of changing pitch according to
                     modulation envelope.  It can  temporarily  express  raising
                     pitch  only  for the attack stage.  The unit, etc. are same
                     as trempitch=.

              modfc=num[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s depth of  changing  cutoff  frequency
                     according  to modulation envelope.  The unit, etc. are same
                     as trempitch=.

              fc=num[,...]
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s standard of  cutoff  frequency.   The
                     unit is Hz.  The format is similar to rate=.

              q=num[,...]
                     Sets  the instrument&apos;s Q (resonance).  The unit is cB.  The
                     format is similar to rate=.

              fckeyf=num
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s filter key follow.  Based on note=60,
                     it  change cutoff frequency according to note.  The unit is
                     +-cent/key.  For example, fckeyf=100 means that it  changes
                     same as pitch.

              fcvelf=num
                     Sets  the  instrument&apos;s  filter  velocity follow.  Based on
                     velocity=127, it  changes  cutoff  frequency  according  to
                     velocity.   The unit is +-cent.  In SoundFont, -2400 is set
                     up as a characteristic value.

              qvelf=num
                     Sets the instrument&apos;s resonance velocity follow.  Based  on
                     velocity=0,  it  changes  resonance  according to velocity.
                     The unit is +-cB.

       default file
              When MIDI program appears, which is not mapped to instrument file,
              this file is pronounced as a substitute.

       map MapID1 from-bank from-prog to-bank to-prog
              The  existing  tone is assigned as a tone of GS/XG each map.  gm2,
              sc55, sc88, sc88pro, sc8850, xg and xgsfx64 can be specified to be
              MapID1.

       map MapID2 from-drumset from-keynote to-drumset to-keynote
              The  existing  drum  is  assigned  as  a  drum  of GS/XG each map.
              gm2drum, sc55drum, sc88drum, sc88prodrum, sc8850drum,  xgdrum  and
              xgsfx126 can be specified to be MapID2.

       soundfont file [options]
              Read the whole SoundFont.  options may be any of the following:

              order=number
                     Sets  the order of searching for instrument.  When order=0,
                     first read SoundFont, and then search for insufficient sam&#8208;
                     ples  in GUS/patch.  When order=1, after reading GUS/patch,
                     search for SoundFont.

              amp=amplification
                     Sets the amplification of the whole SoundFont as amplifica&#8208;
                     tion%.  If the value is not specified, it is set by 100%.

              cutoff=number
                     Specifies whether LPF in SoundFont is enable (1) or disable
                     (0).  If the value is not specified, it is considered to be
                     enable.

              reso=number
                     Specifies  whether  resonance in SoundFont is enable (1) or
                     disable (0).  If the value is not specified, it is  consid&#8208;
                     ered to be enable.

              remove Cancels the target SoundFont from the memory.

       font exclude bank [prog [key]]
              Suppresses  searching  for SoundFont of bank, prog.  If the sample
              is drumset, bank is 128, drumset is prog, keynum is key.

       font order number bank [prog [key]]
              Sets the order of searching for instrument individually.  The for&#8208;
              mat is same as font exclude.

       The following statements are available only latest TiMidity++.

       #extension altassign program1 program2 ...
              Sets  the alternate assign for drum set.  For example, if you want
              to pronounce Hi-Hat cymbals (note number 42, 44  and  46)  in  the
              drumset 0 exclusively to each others, specify:

              drumset 0
              altassign 42 44 46

              Note that alternate assign of drumset 0 is used by default.

       #extension comm program comment
              Specifies  the comment comment for the tone number program.  These
              comments are displayed in the indicator line  when  TiMidity++  is
              booted with option -int, -iTt.

       #extension timeout program second
              Specifies  the time-out value of the program.  If any notes played
              with the tone number program are suspended for  more  than  second
              seconds, TiMidity++ kills the notes.

       #extension copydrumset drumset
              Copies all settings of the drumset to the current drumset.

       #extension copybank bank
              Copies all settings of the bank to the current bank.

       #extension copymap to-MapID from-MapID
              Copies all settings of the banks defined for the map from-MapID to
              the map to-MapID.

       #extension HTTPproxy hostname:port
              Specifies the proxy of the HTTP protocol.  hostname and  port  are
              of the proxy host&apos;s.

       #extension FTPproxy hostname:port
              Specifies the proxy of the FTP protocol.  Same as HTTP.

       #extension mailaddr your-mail-address
              Specifies  user&apos;s  mail  address.  This address is sent to the FTP
              server if TiMidity++ access any file via FTP.

       #extension opt option
              Sets the value of boot-time options.

       #extension undef progno
              Undefines the tone progno of current tone bank.

       #extension legato progno {0|1}
              Specifies whether legato is enable (1) or disable (0) on progno.

       #extension level progno tva_level
              Sets the standard value of changing amplification when  processing
              Drum  Instrument  TVA  Level  of NRPN.  Unless Drum Instrument TVA
              Level is specified at playing, the  amplification  is  not  influ&#8208;
              enced.   progno  can carry out package specification by `,&apos; and/or
              [start]-[end].  If start and end are omitted, they are assumed  to
              be 0 and 127 respectively.

       #extension damper progno {0|1}
              Specifies  whether redamper and half-damper are enable (1) or dis&#8208;
              able (0) on progno.

       #extension playnote progno note
              Sets the frequency of pronounce to note.  If the frequency of pro&#8208;
              nounce  is  specified  by GS SysEx Play Note, the pitch is changed
              appropriately according to the value.  progno can carry out  pack&#8208;
              age  specification  by `,&apos; and/or [start]-[end].  If start and end
              are omitted, they are assumed to be 0 and 127 respectively.
&#12;              For example:
              drumset 0
              #extension playnote -37,39,44-46,55-60

       #extension delaysend progno level
       #extension chorussend progno level
       #extension reverbsend progno level
              Sets the send level when drum part effect is enable.  All  initial
              value are 127.  If one of delay, chorus and reverb is at least set
              up, the effect which is not set as the tone will become  the  ini&#8208;
              tial  value  0.  progno can carry out package specification by `,&apos;
              and/or [start]-[end].  If start and  end  are  omitted,  they  are
              assumed to be 0 and 127 respectively.

       #extension rnddelay progno msec
              For  every  pronunciation, it is random and less than a maximum of
              msec delay.  The distribution of random value is pink  noise  (1/f
              fluctuation) rather than a white noise.

       These  #extension statements are beginning with character `#&apos; that is the
       comment flag of old TiMidity (version 0.2i or earlier).  So these  state&#8208;
       ments are treated as comment line.
       The  latest TiMidity++ treats #extension as white-space.  So you can omit
       it.

       If any file-name expression ended with character `|&apos;  (Ascii  0x7c),  the
       file-name is treated as command and outputs of the command are also exam&#8208;
       ined as arguments of statements.
       source command| causes the output of  command  becomes  the  argument  of
       source.   It  is convenient to choose settings of TiMidity++ according to
       environment.  In addition, if a space enters on the way like  command  |,
       it  will  be  divided  at  the  time of setting file reading, and will no
       longer be regarded as a command.  This function is applicable to all  the
       places that can specify a file name.

              timidity &apos;cat fild.mid|&apos;

       will read from the output of cat fild.mid.
