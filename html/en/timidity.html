NAME
       TiMidity++ - MIDI-to-WAVE converter and player

SYNOPSIS
       timidity [options] filename [...]

DESCRIPTION
       TiMidity++  is  a  converter  that converts some of MIDI files (supported
       formats: Standard MIDI files (*.mid),  Recomposer  files  (*.rcp,  *.r36,
       *.g18,  *.g36) and Module files (*.mod)) into formatted audio files (e.g.
       RIFF WAVE).  TiMidity++ uses Gravis Ultrasound-compatible patch files  or
       Soundfonts (*.sfx, *.sf2) to generate digital audio data from MIDI files.
       The digital audio data generated by TiMidity++ can be stored  in  a  file
       for processing, or played in real time through an audio device.
       In  real time playing, TiMidity++ can show the lyrics contained in KAR or
       WRD files.

FILENAME
       You can use the following expressions as the filename argument:

       -      Read a MIDI file from standard input.

       path/filename
              Read a MIDI file from the specified path on a filesystem.

       dir:directory
       directory/
              Read and play all MIDI files  in  the  specified  directory.   For
              example,

              % timidity some/where/

              plays all files in the directory some/where/.

       Archive File
              Extract and play the file(s) in the archive.  If you want to spec&#8208;
              ify a certain MIDI file in the archive, append #&lt;MIDI-filename&gt; to
              the  archive name.  The path after `#&apos; allows the use of the wild&#8208;
              card expressions (case insensitive).
              You can use escape sequence \xHH, where `HH&apos; is a ASCII number  in
              hexadecimal integer.

              For example:

              % timidity file.zip#file.mid
                     Plays file.mid in file.zip

              % timidity file.lzh#*.mid
                     Plays any files that match the wildcard expression *.mid in
                     file.lzh

              % timidity file.tgz#*
                     This expression is the same as file.tgz

              Since these mechanism are contained in TiMidity++ itself, you  can
              use this syntax even in the MS Windows environment.

              TiMidity++ can handle the following archive formats:

              tar (*.tar)

              tar+gzip (*.tar.gz, *.tgz)

              zip (*.zip)

              lzh (*.lzh, *.lha)
                     (lh0,  lh1,  lh2,  lh3, lh4, lh5, lh6, lz4, lzs and lz5 are
                     available)

              Other archives can be expanded if expander command is specified on
              the compile phase.  TiMidity++ will pipe that command.

       news://news-server[:port]/Message-ID
       news://news-server[:port]/newsgroup[/first-last]
              Play  the  MIDI  file in the specified article on the news server.
              If a newsgroup is specified TiMidity++ plays all MIDI files  found
              in any article posted to that newsgroup.
              TiMidity++  parses  MIME  Multi-part  messages in case of news://*
              scheme, extracts MIDI file that was post to that group, or in case
              of normal file, you can explicitly handle MIME documents by naming
              that file with *.mime extension, or prefix that file with mime:

              The following MIME-types are allowed:

              uu-encoded file
                     begin
                     is required

              base64 encoded
                     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
                     is required

              quoted-string
                     Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-string
                     is required

              Mac BinHex format
                     only HQX format is available

       http://address
       ftp://address
              Play the file specified in the URL.

              For example:

              %               timidity               http://www.goice.co.jp/mem&#8208;
              ber/mo/dist/midi/impromptu.mid
                     plays the specified MIDI-file directly from the network.

              If  these expression are used in the *.cfg files, you can even use
              patch-files (and others) from remote machines.

INPUT FILE
       TiMidity++ can handle the following file formats:

       .mid, .rmi (Format 0, 1, 2)
              Standard MIDI File

       .rcp, .r36, .g18, .g36 (Recomposer formats)
              Recomposer format which is product for COME ON MUSIC co.

       .mfi (MFi Version 3 - Melody Format for i-Mode)
              i-Mode is Japanese local mobile phone

       .kar (Karaoke format)
              Displays the lyrics as a Lyric Meta Event message.

       .mod, mod.* (Module file)

       .wrd (WRD format)

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are accepted by TiMidity++:

       -A [n][,m](a)
       --amplification=n
       --drumpower=m
       --[no-]volume-compensation
              Multiplies the master volume by n%.  Default value is 70%.  Higher
              amplification  makes  louder  sounds.   You  can  specify the drum
              power, ratio of drum volume from the other channels.  The  allowed
              values of amplification range from 0 (no sound) to 800.
              Optionally  to  put  `a&apos; character along with -a option, or to use
              --volume-compensation, instructs TiMidity++ to regularize the vol&#8208;
              ume.  You can easily gain dynamic range.

              For example:

              -A90   volume 90%, drum power 100%, compensation is off

              -A,120 volume 70%, drum power 120%, compensation is off

              -A90,120
                     volume 90%, drum power 120%, compensation is off

              -Aa    volume 70%, drum power 100%, compensation is on

              -A90a  volume 90%, drum power 100%, compensation is on

              -A,120a
                     volume 70%, drum power 120%, compensation is on

              -A90,120a
                     volume 90%, drum power 120%, compensation is on

       -a, --[no-]anti-alias
              Turns  on anti-aliasing.  Samples are run through a lowpass filter
              before playing, which reduces aliasing  noise  at  low  resampling
              frequencies.

       -B n,m, --buffer-fragments=n,m
              For  the  Linux/FreeBSD/OSS/ALSA/Windows sound driver, selects the
              number of buffer fragments in interactive  mode.   Increasing  the
              number  of fragments may reduce choppiness when many processes are
              running.  It will make TiMidity++ seem to  respond  sluggishly  to
              fast  forward,  rewind, and volume controls, and it will throw the
              status display off sync.  Specify a fragments number of 0  to  use
              the maximum number of fragments available.

       -C n, --control-ratio=n
              Sets  the  ratio of sampling and control frequencies.  This deter&#8208;
              mines how often envelopes are recalculated -- small  ratios  yield
              better quality but use more CPU time.

       -c file, --config-file=file
              Reads an extra configuration file.

       -D n, --drum-channel=n
              Marks  channel as a drum channel.  If channel is negative, channel
              -n is marked as an instrumental channel.  If n is 0, all  channels
              are marked as instrumental.

       -d dir, --interface-path=dir
              Specifies  the  directory containing installed dynamic-link inter&#8208;
              face modules.

       -E mode, --ext=mode
              Set TiMidity++ extend modes.  The following  modes  are  available
              (capitalized switch means disable this feature):

              w/W, --[no-]mod-wheel
                     Enable/disable modulation controlling.

              p/P, --[no-]portamento
                     Enable/disable portamento controlling.

              v/V, --[no-]vibrato
                     Enable/disable NRPM vibration.

              s/S, --[no-]ch-pressure
                     Enable/disable channel pressure controlling.
&#12;              e/E, --[no-]mod-envelope
                     Enable/disable modulation envelope controlling.

              t/T, --[no-]trace-text-meta
                     Enable/disable tracing all Text Meta Events.

              o/O, --[no-]overlap-voice
                     Accept/reject pronouncing multiple same notes.

              z/Z, --[no-]temper-control
                     Enable/disable  MIDI  Tuning  Standard temperament control&#8208;
                     ling.

              mHH, --default-mid=HH
                     Sets the manufacturer ID to HH (where HH are  two  hex-dig&#8208;
                     its).
                     HH values of GS/gs, XG/xg or GM/gm are understood as 41, 43
                     and 7e respectively.

              MHH, --system-mid=HH
                     Sets the system manufacturer ID to HH  (where  HH  are  two
                     hex-digits).
                     In  this  option,  the  manufacture ID is set unchangeable.
                     Manufacture ID from the input file would be ignored.

              bn, --default-bank=n
                     Use tone bank n as the default.

              Bn, --force-bank=n
                     Sets the bank number of all channels to n.

              in[/m], --default-program=n[/m]
                     Use the program number as the default instrument.  Any Pro&#8208;
                     gram Change events in MIDI files will override this option.
                     If  n  is  followed by /m the default program number of the
                     channel m is specified by n.

              In[/m], --force-program=n[/m]
                     Similar to -Ei but this ignores all program changes.

              F args For effects.  See below.  In args option, you  can  specify
                     following effect options:

                     delay=(d|l|r|b)[,msec], --delay=(d|l|r|b)[,msec]
                            Sets delay type.

                            d, 0   Disabled delay effect.

                            l, 1   Left delay.

                            r, 2   Right delay.

                            b, 3   Swap left &amp; right.

                            Optional msec is the delay time.

                     chorus=(d|n|s)[,level], --chorus=(d|n|s)[,level]

                            d, 0   Disable this effect.

                            n, 1   Enable MIDI chorus effect control.

                            s, 2   Surround  sound,  chorus  detuned to a lesser
                                   degree (default).

                            The optional parameter level  specifies  the  chorus
                            level 0 to 127.

                     reverb=(d|n|g|f|G)[,level], --reverb=(d|n|g|f|G)[,level]

                            d, 0   Disable MIDI reverb effect control.
&#12;                            n, 1   Enable  MIDI  reverb  effect  control.   This
                                   effect is only available in stereo.

                            g, 2   Global reverb effect.

                            f, 3   Freeverb   MIDI   reverb    effect    control
                                   (default).

                            G, 4   Global freeverb effect.

                            The  optional  parameter  level specifies the reverb
                            level 0 to 127.

                     vlpf=(d|c|m), --voice-lpf=(d|c|m)

                            d, 0   Disable LPF effect.

                            c, 1   Chamberlin resonant LPF (12dB/oct) (default).

                            m, 2   Moog resonant low-pass VCF (24dB/oct)

                     ns=n, --noise-shaping=n
                            Enable the n th  degree  noiseshaping  filter.   The
                            distortion at decay stage is improved, but the noise
                            on  human  auditory  feeling  increases  because  it
                            shifts to a high frequency.  In case of 8-bit linear
                            encoding, valid values of n are in the interval from
                            0 (min) to 4 (max).  Default value is 4.  In case of
                            16-bit linear encoding, valid values of n are in the
                            interval  from  0  to 4.  According to the value, it
                            works as following.  Default value is 4.

                            0      No noise shaping.

                            1      Traditional noise shaping.

                            2      Overdrive-like  soft-clipping  +  new   noise
                                   shaping.

                            3      Tube-amplifier-like soft-clipping + new noise
                                   shaping.

                            4      New noise shaping.

                     resamp=(d|l|c|L|n|g), --resample=(d|l|c|L|n|g)

                            d, 0   No interpolation.

                            l, 1   Linear interpolation.

                            c, 2   Cubic spline interpolation.

                            L, 3   Lagrange method.

                            n, 4   Newton polynomial interpolation.

                            g, 5   Modified Gauss effect (default).

                            This option affects the behavior of -N option.

       -e, --evil
              Make TiMidity++ evil.  For the Win32 version, this  increases  the
              task priority by one.  It can give better playback when you switch
              tasks at the expense of slowing all other tasks down.

       -F, --[no-]fast-panning
              Turns on fast panning to accommodate MIDI pieces that expect  pan&#8208;
              ning  adjustments  to affect notes that are already playing.  Some
              files that don&apos;t expect this have  a  habit  of  flipping  balance
              rapidly  between  left  and  right, which can cause severe popping
              when the -F flag is used.
              In the current version of TiMidity++ this option is a toggle.

       -f, --[no-]fast-decay
              Toggles fast envelopes.  This option makes TiMidity++  faster  but
              the release time of the notes are shortened.

       -g sec, --spectrogram=sec
              Open  the  Sound-Spectrogram  window.  This option is activated if
              the system has support for the X Window System.

       -H n, --force-keysig=n
              Specify the key signature.  MIDI playback is transposed to the key
              with the same number of sharps (when n is positive) or flats (when
              n is negative).  Valid values for n range from -7 to 7.  For exam&#8208;
              ple,  if  n  is  1,  MIDI playback would transpose 1 flat (i.e., F
              major or D minor).

       -h, --help
              Show the help message.

       -i mode, --interface=mode
       --realtime-priority=n
       --sequencer-ports=n
              Selects the user interfaces  from  the  compiled-in  alternatives.
              mode  must  be  begun  with one of the supported interface identi&#8208;
              fiers.  Run TiMidity++ with the -h option to see a list.
              For ALSA sequencer interface, optionally to use  --realtime-prior&#8208;
              ity, set the realtime priority by n, and to use --sequencer-ports,
              set the number of opened sequencer ports.  Default value is 4.
              The following identifiers may be available:

              -id    dumb interface

              -in    ncurses interface

              -is    S-Lang interface

              Interface options
                     Option characters may be added immediately after the inter&#8208;
                     face identifier.  The following options are recognized:

                     v, --verbose=n
                            Increases verbosity level.  This option  is  cumula&#8208;
                            tive.

                     q, --quiet=n
                            Decreases  verbosity  level.  This option is cumula&#8208;
                            tive.

                     t, --[no-]trace
                            Toggles  trace  mode.   In  trace  mode,  TiMidity++
                            attempts  to display its current state in real time.
                            For the Linux sound  driver,  this  is  accomplished
                            through the use of short DMA buffer fragments, which
                            can be tuned via the -B option.

                     l, --[no-]loop
                            Loop playing (some interfaces ignore this option)

                     r, --[no-]random
                            Randomize file list arguments before playing

                     s, --[no-]sort
                            Sort file list arguments before playing

                     D, --[no-]background
                            Daemonize  TiMidity++  in  background  (for  alsaseq
                            only)

       -j, --[no-]realtime-load
              Enable the loading of patch files during play.

       -K n, --adjust-key=n
              Adjusts  key  (i.e., transposes the song) by n half tones.  Ranges
              from -24 to 24.

       -k msec, --voice-queue=msec
              Specify audio queue time limit to reduce voices.  If the remaining
              audio  buffer  is less than msec milliseconds, TiMidity++ tries to
              kill some voices.  This feature makes it possible to play  compli&#8208;
              cated  MIDI files on slow CPUs.  Setting msec to zero tells TiMid&#8208;
              ity++ to never remove any voices.

       -L path, --patch-path=path
              Adds path to the library path.   Patch,  configuration,  and  MIDI
              files  are  searched along this path.  Directories added last will
              be searched first.  Note that  the  current  directory  is  always
              searched first before the library path.

       -M name, --pcm-file=name
              TiMidity++  can  play  a  PCM  file  instead  of  a MIDI file.  If
              ``auto&apos;&apos; is specified, TiMidity++ tries  to  open  foo.mid.wav  or
              foo.mid.aiff when playing foo.mid.  If ``none&apos;&apos; is specified, this
              feature is disabled.  Otherwise just plays name.

       -m msec, --decay-time=msec
              Modify envelope volume decay time.  msec is the minimum number  of
              milliseconds to sustain a sustained note.

              -m0    Disable  sustain  ramping,  causes constant volume sustains
                     (default).

              -m1    Effectively behaves as if all sustains are ignored,  volume
                     ramping is the same as normal stage 3.

              -m3000 A  note  at  full  volume  will decay for 3 seconds once it
                     begins to be sustained (assuming the regular stage  3  rate
                     would  not  cause  it  to decay even longer).  Softer notes
                     will of course die sooner.

       -N n, --interpolation=n
              Sets interpolation parameter.  This option depends on  the  -EFre&#8208;
              samp option&apos;s value.

              cspline, lagrange
                     Toggles 4-point linear interpolation (default is on).
&#12;              newton n  point interpolation using Newton polynomials.  n must be
                     an odd number from 1 to 57.

              gauss  n+1 point modified Gauss interpolation.  Ranges 0 (disable)
                     to 34 (max), default to 25.

              In either way, linear interpolation is used if audio queue &lt; 99%.

       -O mode, --output-mode=mode
       --flac-verify
       --flac-padding=n

       --speex-vad
       --speex-dtx
       --speex-complexity=n
       --speex-nframes=n
              Selects  the  output mode from the compiled-in alternatives.  mode
              must begin with one of the supported output mode identifiers.  Run
              TiMidity++ with the -h option to see the list.
              Special in Ogg FLAC output mode, verifying generated data (will be
              a bit slower), the size of header padding (default is  4096),  the
              compression  level  (0  to 8) (default is 5), and enabling OggFLAC
              stream  can  be  specified   by   --flac-verify,   --flac-padding,
              --flac-complevel and --oggflac options respectively.
              Special  in  Ogg  Speex output mode, the compression quality (0 to
              10) (default is 8), Enabling VBR output, enabling ABR  output  and
              setting  the  ratio to n, enabling VAD (voice activity detection),
              enabling DTX (discontinuous transmission), the encoding complexity
              (0  to 10) (default is 3), and frames in a single Ogg packet (0 to
              10)  (default  is  1)  can  be   specified   by   --speex-quality,
              --speex-vbr,  --speex-abr,  --speex-vad, --speex-dtx, --speex-com&#8208;
              plexity and --speex-nframes options respectively.
              The following identifiers are available in all versions:

              -Od    Outputs via audio device (default)

              -Os    Output to ALSA

              -Or    Generate raw waveform data.  All format  options  are  sup&#8208;
                     ported.  Common formats include:

                     -OrU   u-Law

                     -Or1sl 16-bit signed linear PCM

                     -Or8ul 8-bit unsigned linear PCM

              -Ou    Generate Sun Audio (au) data

              -Oa    Generate AIFF data

              -Ow    Generate RIFF WAVE format output.  If output is directed to
                     a non-seekable file, or if TiMidity++ is interrupted before
                     closing  the  file, the file header will contain 0xffffffff
                     in the RIFF and data  block  length  fields.   The  popular
                     sound conversion utility sox is able to read such malformed
                     files, so you can pipe data directly to sox for  on-the-fly
                     conversion to other formats.

              Format options
                     Option  characters  may be added immediately after the mode
                     identifier to change  the  output  format.   The  following
                     options are recognized:

                     S, --output-stereo
                            Stereo

                     M, --output-mono
                            Monophonic

                     s, --output-signed
                            Signed output

                     u, --output-unsigned
                            Unsigned output

                     1, --output-16bit
                            16-bit sample width

                     2, --output-24bit
                            24-bit sample width

                     8, --output-8bit
                            8-bit sample width

                     l, --output-linear
                            Linear encoding

                     U, --output-ulaw
                            u-Law (8-bit) encoding

                     A, --output-alaw
                            A-Law encoding

                     x, --[no-]output-swab
                            Byte-swapped output

                     Note  that  some options have no effect on some modes.  For
                     example, you cannot generate a byte-swapped RIFF WAVE file,
                     or force uLaw output on a Linux PCM device.

       -o file, --output-file=file
              Place  output on file, which may be a file, device, or HP-UX audio
              server, depending on the output mode selected with the -O  option.
              The special filename `-&apos; causes output to be placed on stdout.

       -P file, --patch-file=file
              Use patch file for all programs.

       -p [n](a)
       --polyphony=n
       --[no-]polyphony-reduction
              Sets polyphony (maximum number of simultaneous voices) to n.
              Optionally  to  put  `a&apos; character along with -p option, or to use
              --polyphony-reduction, instructs TiMidity++  to  enable  automatic
              polyphony reduction algorithm.

       -Q n[,...](t)
       --mute=n[,...]
       --temper-mute=n[,...]
              Cause  channel  n to be quiet.  n can carry out package specifica&#8208;
              tion by `,&apos;.  If n is 0, all channels are  turned  off.   Continu&#8208;
              ously, specifying -n, channel n is turned back on.
              On  the other hand, to put `t&apos; character after -Q option or to use
              --temper-mute describes temperament mute.  This mutes channels  of
              specific  temperament type n.  For preset temperament, n can range
              0 to 3.  For user-defined temperament, n can range 4 to 7.

       -q sec/n, --audio-buffer=sec/n
              Specify audio buffer in seconds.  sec maximum size  of  buffer,  n
              percentage  filled  at the beginning (default is 5.0/100) (size of
              100% equals the whole device buffer size).

       -R msec
              Enables Pseudo Reverb Mode.  It sets every instrument&apos;s release to
              msec ms.  If msec is 0, msec is set to 800 (default).

       -S n, --cache-size=n
              Sets  the re-sample cache size to n bytes.  If n equals 0 any sam&#8208;
              ple caches are disabled.  The default value of n is 2097152 (2MB).

       -s freq, --sampling-freq=freq
              Sets the resampling frequency (Hz or kHz).  Not all sound  devices
              are  capable of all frequencies -- an approximate frequency may be
              selected, depending on the implementation.

       -T n, --adjust-tempo=n
              Adjust tempo to n%; 120 play MOD files with an NTSC  Amiga&apos;s  tim&#8208;
              ing.

       -t code, --output-charset=code
              Sets output coding of Japanese text.  Possible values of code are:

              auto   determined by the LANG environment variable.

              ascii  Translates non-ASCII code to period.

              nocnv  No conversion.

              1251   Convert from windows-1251 to koi8-r.

              euc    Outputs EUC (Japan) coding.

              jis    Outputs JIS coding.

              sjis   Outputs SJIS coding.

       -U, --[no-]unload-instruments
              Unload  all  instruments from memory between MIDI files.  This can
              reduce memory requirements when playing many files in succession.

       -V power, --volume-curve=power
              Set the power of volume curve.  The  total  amplification  becomes
              volume^power.   0 (default) uses the regular tables.  Any non-zero
              value causes all midi to use the new  user  defined  velocity/vol&#8208;
              ume/expression curve (linear: 1, ideal: ~1.661, GS: ~2).

       -v, --version
              Show the version string

       -W mode, --wrd=mode
              Play WRD file.

              Allowed values of mode are:

              x      X Window System mode

              w      Windows console mode

              t      TTY mode

              d      Dumb mode (outputs WRD events directory)

              -      do not trace WRD

              R[opts]
                     Sets WRD options:
&#12;                     a1=b1,a2=b2,...
                            Sets  the WRD options.  an is the name of option and
                            bn is the value.

                     d=n    Emulates timing (@WAIT, @WMODE) bugs of the original
                            MIMPI player.  The emulation levels are:

                            -WRd=0 do not emulate any bugs of MIMPI

                            -WRd=1 only emulate some bugs (default)

                            -WRd=2 emulate all known bugs

                     F=file Use  file as WRD file only no file matching *.wrd is
                            found.

                     f=file Uses file as WRD file.

              WRD mode must also use trace mode (option -i?t) or the  timing  of
              the WRD events will be terrible.

       -w mode, --rcpcv-dll=mode
              Extended  mode  for  MS Windows.  The following options are avail&#8208;
              able:

              -w r   Use rcpcv.dll to play RCP/R36 files.

              -w R   Do not use rcpcv.dll (default).

       -x str, --config-string=str
              Configure TiMidity++ with str.  The format of str is the  same  as
              timidity.cfg.

              For example:
              -x&apos;bank 0\n0 violin.pat&apos;
              Sets the instrument number 0 to violin.
              Character `\&apos; (Ascii 0x5c) in the str is treated as escape charac&#8208;
              ter like in C literals.  For example \n  is  treated  as  carriage
              return.

       -Z file, --freq-table=file
              Cause the table of frequencies to be read from file.  This is use&#8208;
              ful to define a tuning different from  12-equal  temperament.   If
              ``pure&apos;&apos; is specified, TiMidity++ plays in trial pure intonation.

              -Zpure[n(m)], --pure-intonation=[n(m)]
                     Play  in  trial pure intonation by Key Signature meta-event
                     in the MIDI file.  You can specify the  initial  keysig  by
                     hand,   in  case  the  MIDI  file  does  not  contains  the
                     meta-event.  Optionally, n is the number of key  signature.
                     In  case  of  sharp,  n is positive.  In case of flat, n is
                     negative.  Valid values of n are in the interval from -7 to
                     7.   In  case  of  minor mode, you should put `m&apos; character
                     along with -Zpure option.

       --module=n
              Simulate behavior of specific synthesizer module as much as possi&#8208;
              ble.  For the moment, the value of n defined is as follows:
