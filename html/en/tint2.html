TINT2(1)                                                                TINT2(1)



NAME
       tint2 - lightweight panel/taskbar

SYNOPSIS
       tint2
       tint2 -c /path_to_config_file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tint2 command.

       tint2  is  a  simple  panel/taskbar  intentionally made for openbox3, but
       should also work with other window managers. It&apos;s based on ttm code.  The
       goal  is  to  keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and
       compliance with freedesktop specifications.

       On  the  first  startup  tint2  creates  a  config  file  in  $HOME/.con&#8208;
       fig/tint2/tint2rc.

       See  wiki  page  on  http://code.google.com/p/tint2/wiki/Welcome for more
       information.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
              Specify which configuration file to use instead of the default.
