tmpfs(5)                  Debian Administrator&apos;s Manual                 tmpfs(5)



NAME
       tmpfs - variables that configure tmpfs filesystems mounted during boot

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/default/tmpfs file contains variable settings in POSIX format:

            VAR=VAL

       Only  one  assignment  is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with &apos;#&apos;)
       are also allowed.

       This file is for the configuration of tmpfs filesystems mounted in  early
       boot,  before  filesystems  from  /etc/fstab are mounted.  This currently
       includes the filesystems /run, /run/lock, /run/shm  and  /tmp.   /run  is
       required to be a tmpfs on systems supporting tmpfs mounts.  /run/lock and
       /run/shm may be separate tmpfs mounts, useful for enforcing separate size
       limits.  /tmp is not required to be a tmpfs, but is mounted as a tmpfs by
       default.

       /run   Previously configured using RAMRUN in  /etc/default/rcS,  /run  is
              now  always mounted as a ram file system (tmpfs).  The size of the
              tmpfs  can  be  controlled  using  TMPFS_SIZE  and  RUN_SIZE.   If
              desired,  the  defaults may also be overridden with an entry in in
              /etc/fstab, for example:

              tmpfs     /run tmpfs     nodev,nosuid,size=10%,mode=755     0    0


              The contents of /run will always be lost on system reboot, and  it
              it  is  no  longer  explicitly  cleaned at boot.  Packages can not
              expect directories in /run to exist after boot.  Packages  expect&#8208;
              ing  this are buggy and need to be fixed.  Note that /run was pre&#8208;
              viously /var/run, and a compatibility symlink or bind  mount  will
              be created to allow the old path to continue to function.


       /run/lock
              Previously  configured using RAMLOCK in /etc/default/rcS.  Config&#8208;
              ured using RAMLOCK, TMPFS_SIZE and  LOCK_SIZE.   If  desired,  the
              defaults  may  also  be overridden with an entry in in /etc/fstab,
              for example:

              tmpfs     /run/lock tmpfs     nodev,noexec,nosuid,size=52428800,mode=1777  0    0


              Note that  irrespective  of  these  settings,  /run/lock  will  be
              located  on  a  tmpfs,  either  one  mounted on /run/lock (if RAM&#8208;
              LOCK=yes) or one mounted on /run (if RAMLOCK=no), and as a  result
              the  contents  of  /var/lock will always be lost on system reboot,
              and it it is no longer explicitly cleaned at boot.   Packages  can
              not expect directories in /var/lock to exist after boot.  Packages
              expecting this  are  buggy  and  need  to  be  fixed.   Note  that
              /run/lock was previously /var/lock, and a compatibility symlink or
              bind mount will be created to allow the old path  to  continue  to
              function.


       /run/shm
              Previously configured using RAMSHM in /etc/default/rcS.  Note that
              the setting in /etc/default/rcS, if present, will still  be  used,
              but  the  setting  in  /etc/default/tmpfs  will take precedence if
              enabled.  Configured using RAMSHM, TMPFS_SIZE  and  SHM_SIZE.   If
              desired,  the  defaults may also be overridden with an entry in in
              /etc/fstab, for example:

              tmpfs     /run/shm  tmpfs     nosuid,nodev,size=40%,mode=1777    0    0


              Packages can not expect directories in  /run/shm  to  exist  after
              boot.   Note that /run/shm was previously /dev/shm, and a compati&#8208;
              bility symlink or bind mount will be created to allow the old path
              to  continue  to  function.  If an fstab entry for /dev/shm exists
              instead of /run/shm, then /dev/shm will continue to be used;  note
              that this is only needed for users of newer versions of the Oracle
              database, which contain a buggy check for /dev/shm.


       /tmp   Previously configured using RAMTMP in /etc/default/rcS.  Note that
              the  setting  in /etc/default/rcS, if present, will still be used,
              but the setting in  /etc/default/tmpfs  will  take  precedence  if
              enabled.   Configured  using  RAMTMP, TMPFS_SIZE and TMP_SIZE.  If
              desired, the defaults may also be overridden with an entry  in  in
              /etc/fstab, for example:

              tmpfs     /tmp tmpfs     nodev,nosuid,size=20%,mode=1777    0    0


              Packages can not expect directories in /tmp to exist after boot.


OPTIONS
       The following variables can be set.


   Enabling or disabling tmpfs mounts
       The following options enable specific mounts (with the exception of /run)
       to be enabled or disabled.   Note  that  the  addition  of  an  entry  to
       /etc/fstab  for  any  of the following will enable the mount uncondition&#8208;
       ally, overriding the setting here.


       RAMLOCK
              Mount /run/lock as a tmpfs (separately from  /run).   Defaults  to
              yes; set to no to disable (/run/lock will then be part of the /run
              tmpfs, if available).


       RAMSHM Mount /run/shm as a tmpfs (separately  from  /run).   Defaults  to
              yes;  set to no to disable (/run/shm will then be part of the /run
              tmpfs, if available).


       RAMTMP Mount /tmp as a tmpfs.  Defaults to no; set to yes to enable (/tmp
              will  be  part of the root filesystem if disabled).  /tmp may also
              be configured to be a separate mount  in  /etc/fstab,  which  will
              override the RAMTMP setting.


   Configuring size limits for tmpfs mounts
       The  following options configure size limits for tmpfs mounts.  Note that
       the addition of an entry to /etc/fstab will override any  of  the  limits
       specified here.

       The  following _SIZE variables are the maximum size (in bytes) that tmpfs
       filesystems can use.  The size will be rounded down to a multiple of  the
       page size, 4096 bytes.  If no size is set, TMPFS_SIZE will be used as the
       default.
&#12;       More complex mount options may be used by  the  creation  of  a  suitable
       entry in /etc/fstab.  For example:

       tmpfs     /run tmpfs     size=10%  0    0

       is equivalent to

       RUN_SIZE=10%

       and  will  override  the  RUN_SIZE  setting.   This will allow additional
       options such as nr_blocks and nr_inodes to be used, and  also  adjustment
       of  the  mode,  nodev,  nosuid, noexec options should any change from the
       defaults be necessary.


       TMPFS_SIZE
              Maximum size for all tmpfs filesystems if no specific size is pro&#8208;
              vided.   The  default  is  20%VM (20% of virtual memory, including
              swap space).  If no value is provided  here,  the  kernel  default
              (50% RAM) will be used.  Note that the &quot;%VM&quot; suffix may be used in
              this and all the _SIZE settings below, but  may  not  be  used  in
              /etc/fstab (the absolute size is calculated by the init scripts).


       RUN_SIZE
              Maximum  size  of  /run (was previously /var/run).  The default is
              10% core memory; the size required varies  widely  depending  upon
              the  demands of the software being run; this heuristic scales /run
              usage on system size.  Samba in particular has been seen to use at
              least 50MiB in a large heavily used server.  Typical usage is hun&#8208;
              dreds of KiB, maximum is tens of MiB.


       LOCK_SIZE
              Maximum size of /run/lock (was previously /var/lock).  Defaults to
              5242880  (5 MiB).  Typical usage: tens of KiB; maximum hundreds of
              KiB.  The default of 5  MiB  should  ensure  the  limit  is  never
              reached.


       SHM_SIZE
              Maximum  size  of  /run/shm (was previously /dev/shm).  No default
              size; the size required varies widely depending upon  the  demands
              of the software being run.


       TMP_SIZE
              Maximum size of /tmp.  No default size.


   Emergency overflow /tmp
       If  the amount of free space on the root filesystem falls below a certain
       size, a tmpfs will be mounted on /tmp (irrespective of  the  RAMTMP  set&#8208;
       ting,  which  this overrides).  This is to permit logins when there would
       otherwise be too little free space for this to be possible.


       TMP_OVERFLOW_LIMIT
              Mount a tmpfs on /tmp if the amount of  free  space  on  the  root
              filesystem is below the specified limit at boot time (default 1024
              KiB).
