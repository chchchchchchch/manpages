TMPNAM(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  TMPNAM(3)



NAME
       tmpnam, tmpnam_r - create a name for a temporary file

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       char *tmpnam(char *s);

DESCRIPTION
       The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid file&#8208;
       name, and such that a file with this name did not exist at some point  in
       time, so that naive programmers may think it a suitable name for a tempo&#8208;
       rary file.  If the argument s is NULL this name is generated in an inter&#8208;
       nal  static  buffer  and may be overwritten by the next call to tmpnam().
       If s is not NULL, the name is copied to the character array (of length at
       least  L_tmpnam)  pointed  to by s and the value s is returned in case of
       success.

       The pathname that is created, has a  directory  prefix  P_tmpdir.   (Both
       L_tmpnam  and  P_tmpdir  are  defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt;, just like the TMP_MAX
       mentioned below.)

RETURN VALUE
       The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to a unique  temporary  filename,
       or NULL if a unique name cannot be generated.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4,  4.3BSD,  C89,  C99,  POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 marks tmpnam() as
       obsolete.

NOTES
       The tmpnam() function generates  a  different  string  each  time  it  is
       called,  up  to  TMP_MAX times.  If it is called more than TMP_MAX times,
       the behavior is implementation defined.

       Although tmpnam() generates names that are difficult to guess, it is nev&#8208;
       ertheless  possible  that  between the time that tmpnam() returns a path&#8208;
       name, and the time that the program opens it, another program might  cre&#8208;
       ate  that  pathname using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link.  This
       can lead to security holes.  To avoid such possibilities, use the open(2)
       O_EXCL  flag to open the pathname.  Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmp&#8208;
       file(3).

       Portable applications that use threads cannot call tmpnam() with  a  NULL
       argument  if  either  _POSIX_THREADS  or  _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is
       defined.

       A POSIX draft proposed to use a function tmpnam_r() defined by

           char *
           tmpnam_r(char *s)
           {
               return s ? tmpnam(s) : NULL;
           }

       apparently as a warning not to use NULL.  A few systems implement it.  To
       get   a   glibc  prototype  for  this  function  from  &lt;stdio.h&gt;,  define
       _SVID_SOURCE or _BSD_SOURCE (before including any header file).
&#12;BUGS
       Never use this function.  Use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3) instead.
