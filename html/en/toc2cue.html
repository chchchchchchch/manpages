TOC2CUE(1)                           CDRDAO                           TOC2CUE(1)



NAME
       toc2cue - converts a TOC files of cdrdao(1) into a .cue file


SYNOPSIS
       toc2cue [-v verbosity_level] input_toc_file output_cue_file

       toc2cue [-V]


DESCRIPTION
       toc2cue converts a TOC file of cdrdao(1) into a .cue file.

       Please note that the resulting cue file is only valid if the toc-file was
       created with cdrdao(1) using the commands &apos;read-toc&apos;  or  &apos;read-cd&apos;.  For
       manually  created  or  edited  toc-files the cue file may not be correct.
       This program just checks for the most obvious toc-file features that can&#8208;
       not  be  converted  to  a cue file. Furthermore, if the toc-file contains
       audio tracks the byte order of the image file will be  wrong.  This  will
       result in static noise when the cue file is used for recording (even with
       cdrdao(1) itself).


OPTIONS
       -v verbosity_level
              Sets the verbosity level to use, can be a integer between 1 and 3.
              By  default, only fatal errors are displayed. A verbosity level of
              1 shows warnings, 2 warnings and errors, 3  warnings,  errors  and
              internal errors.

       -V     Prints the version of toc2cue.
