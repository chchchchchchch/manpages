toe(1)                                                                    toe(1)



NAME
       toe - table of (terminfo) entries

SYNOPSIS
       toe [-v[n]] [-ahuUV] file...

DESCRIPTION
       With  no  options, toe lists all available terminal types by primary name
       with descriptions.  File arguments specify the directories to be scanned;
       if  no  such  arguments  are  given,  your  default terminfo directory is
       scanned.  If you also specify the -h option, a directory header  will  be
       issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:

       -a     report  on  all  of  the  terminal  databases  which ncurses would
              search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

       -u file
              says to write a report to the standard output,  listing  dependen&#8208;
              cies  in  the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The report con&#8208;
              denses the `use&apos; relation: each line consists of the primary  name
              of a terminal that has use capabilities, followed by a colon, fol&#8208;
              lowed by the whitespace-separated primary names of  all  terminals
              which occur in those use capabilities, followed by a newline

       -U file
              says  to  write  a  report to the standard output, listing reverse
              dependencies in  the  given  terminfo/termcap  source  file.   The
              report reverses the `use&apos; relation: each line consists of the pri&#8208;
              mary name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities,  followed
              by  a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of
              all terminals which depend on it, followed by a newline.

       -vn    specifies that (verbose) output  be  written  to  standard  error,
              showing toe&apos;s progress.  The optional parameter n is a number from
              1 to 10, interpreted as for tic(1).

       -V     reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
              exits.

FILES
