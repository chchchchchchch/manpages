NAME
       top - display Linux processes


SYNOPSIS
       top -hv|-bcHisS -d delay -n limit -u|U user -p pid -w [cols]

       The traditional switches &apos;-&apos; and whitespace are optional.


DESCRIPTION
       The  top  program  provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.
       It can display system summary information as well as a list of  processes
       or  threads  currently  being  managed by the Linux kernel.  The types of
       system summary information shown and the types, order and size of  infor&#8208;
       mation displayed for processes are all user configurable and that config&#8208;
       uration can be made persistent across restarts.

       The program provides a limited interactive interface for process  manipu&#8208;
       lation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal configura&#8208;
       tion  --  encompassing every aspect of its operation.  And while  top  is
       referred  to  throughout  this document, you are free to name the program
       anything you wish.  That new  name,  possibly  an  alias,  will  then  be
       reflected on top&apos;s display and used when reading and writing a configura&#8208;
       tion file.

&#12;
   Operation
       When operating top, the two most important keys are the help (&apos;h&apos; or &apos;?&apos;)
       key  and  quit (&apos;q&apos;) key.  Alternatively, you could simply use the tradi&#8208;
       tional interrupt key (&apos;^C&apos;) when you&apos;re done.

       Some of top&apos;s screens or functions require the use of cursor motion  keys
       like  the standard arrow keys plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.  If
       your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following keys
       are accepted for compatibility:
              key      equivalents
              Up       alt + \   or   alt + k
              Down     alt + /   or   alt + j
              Left     alt + &lt;   or   alt + h
              Right    alt + &gt;   or   alt + l  (lower case L)
              PgUp     alt + Up
              PgDn     alt + Down
              Home     alt + Left
              End      alt + Right

       When  you  start  top  for the first time, you&apos;ll be presented with these
       traditional screen elements: 1) Summary Area; 2)  Fields/Columns  Header;
       3)  Task Area.  These areas will be explored in the sections that follow.
       There is also an Input/Message line between the Summary Area and  Columns
       Header which needs no further explanation.

       Note:  the width of top&apos;s display will be limited to 512 positions.  Dis&#8208;
       playing all fields  requires  approximately  250  characters.   Remaining
       screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns currently
       visible.  The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic
       3a.  DESCRIPTIONS  of Fields.  Actual output width may also be influenced
       by the -w switch, which is discussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options.


   Startup Defaults
       The following startup defaults assume no configuration file, thus no user
       customizations.   Even  so,  items  shown with an asterisk (&#180;*&#180;) could be
       overridden through the command-line.  All are explained in detail in  the
       sections that follow.

           Global-defaults
              &apos;A&apos; - Alt display      Off (full-screen)
            * &apos;d&apos; - Delay time       3.0 seconds
            * &apos;H&apos; - Threads mode     Off (summarize as tasks)
              &apos;I&apos; - Irix mode        On  (no, &apos;solaris&apos; smp)
            * &apos;p&apos; - PID monitoring   Off (show all processes)

           Summary-Area-defaults
              &apos;l&apos; - Load Avg/Uptime  On  (thus program name)
              &apos;t&apos; - Task/Cpu states  On  (1+1 lines, see &apos;1&apos;)
              &apos;m&apos; - Mem/Swap usage   On  (2 lines worth)
              &apos;1&apos; - Single Cpu       On  (thus 1 line if smp)
           Task-Area-defaults
              &apos;b&apos; - Bold hilite      On  (not &apos;reverse&apos;)
            * &apos;c&apos; - Command line     Off (name, not cmdline)
            * &apos;i&apos; - Idle tasks       On  (show all tasks)
              &apos;R&apos; - Reverse sort     On  (pids high-to-low)
            * &apos;S&apos; - Cumulative time  Off (no, dead children)
            * &apos;u&apos; - User filter      Off (show euid only)
            * &apos;U&apos; - User filter      Off (show any uid)

              &apos;z&apos; - color/mono       Off (no, colors)
&#12;1. COMMAND-LINE Options
       The command-line syntax for top consists of:

         -hv | -bcHisS -d delay -n limit -u|U user | -p pid -w [cols]

       The typically mandatory switches (&apos;-&apos;) and even whitespace are completely
       optional.


       -h | -v : Help/Version
            Show library version and the usage prompt, then quit.


       -b : Batch-mode operation
            Starts top in &apos;Batch&apos; mode, which could be useful for sending output
            from top to other programs or to a file.  In this mode, top will not
            accept input and runs until the iterations limit you&apos;ve set with the
            &apos;-n&apos; command-line option or until killed.


       -c : Command-line/Program-name toggle
            Starts  top  with  the last remembered &apos;c&apos; state reversed.  Thus, if
            top was displaying command lines, now that field will  show  program
            names,  and  visa  versa.  See the &apos;c&apos; interactive command for addi&#8208;
            tional information.


       -d : Delay-time interval as:  -d ss.tt (secs.tenths)
            Specifies the delay between screen updates, and overrides the corre&#8208;
            sponding  value  in one&apos;s personal configuration file or the startup
            default.  Later this can be changed with the &apos;d&apos; or &apos;s&apos;  interactive
            commands.

            Fractional  seconds  are  honored,  but  a  negative  number  is not
            allowed.  In all cases, however, such changes are prohibited if  top
            is  running  in  &apos;Secure mode&apos;, except for root (unless the &apos;s&apos; com&#8208;
            mand-line option was used).  For additional information  on  &apos;Secure
            mode&apos; see topic 6a. SYSTEM Configuration File.


       -H : Threads-mode operation
            Instructs  top  to  display  individual  threads.  Without this com&#8208;
            mand-line option a summation of  all  threads  in  each  process  is
            shown.  Later this can be changed with the &apos;H&apos; interactive command.


       -i : Idle-process toggle
            Starts  top  with the last remembered &apos;i&apos; state reversed.  When this
            toggle is Off, tasks that have not  used  any  CPU  since  the  last
            update  will not be displayed.  For additional information regarding
            this toggle see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SIZE.


       -n : Number-of-iterations limit as:  -n number
            Specifies the maximum number of iterations, or  frames,  top  should
            produce before ending.


       -p : Monitor-PIDs mode as:  -pN1 -pN2 ...  or  -pN1,N2,N3 ...
            Monitor  only processes with specified process IDs.  This option can
            be given up to 20 times, or you can provide a comma  delimited  list
            with up to 20 pids.  Co-mingling both approaches is permitted.

            A  pid  value  of  zero will be treated as the process id of the top
            program itself once it is running.
&#12;            This is a command-line option only and should you wish to return  to
            normal  operation,  it  is not necessary to quit and and restart top
             --  just issue any of these interactive commands: &apos;=&apos;, &apos;u&apos; or &apos;U&apos;.

            The &apos;p&apos;, &apos;u&apos; and &apos;U&apos; command-line options are mutually exclusive.


       -s : Secure-mode operation
            Starts top with secure mode forced, even for root.  This mode is far
            better  controlled  through the system configuration file (see topic
            6. FILES).


       -S : Cumulative-time toggle
            Starts top with the last remembered &apos;S&apos; state reversed.  When &apos;Cumu&#8208;
            lative  time&apos;  mode  is On, each process is listed with the cpu time
            that it and its dead children have used.  See  the  &apos;S&apos;  interactive
            command for additional information regarding this mode.


       -u | -U : User-filter-mode as:  -u | -U number or name
            Display  only  processes  with  a user id or user name matching that
            given.  The &apos;-u&apos; option matches on  effective user whereas the  &apos;-U&apos;
            option matches on any user (real, effective, saved, or filesystem).

            The &apos;p&apos;, &apos;u&apos; and &apos;U&apos; command-line options are mutually exclusive.


       -w : Output-width-override as:  -w [ number ]
            In  &apos;Batch&apos; mode, when used without an argument top will format out&#8208;
            put using the COLUMNS= and LINES=  environment  variables,  if  set.
            Otherwise,  width will be fixed at the maximum 512 columns.  With an
            argument, output width can be decreased or increased (up to 512) but
            the number of rows is considered unlimited.

            In  normal  display  mode,  when  used  without an argument top will
            attempt to format output using the COLUMNS= and  LINES=  environment
            variables,  if  set.   With  an  argument,  output width can only be
            decreased, not increased.  Whether using environment variables or an
            argument  with  -w,  when not in &apos;Batch&apos; mode actual terminal dimen&#8208;
            sions can never be exceeded.

            Note: Without the use of this command-line option, output  width  is
            always based on the terminal at which top was invoked whether or not
            in &apos;Batch&apos; mode.


2. SUMMARY Display
       Each of the following three areas are individually controlled through one
       or  more  interactive  commands.  See topic 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands for
       additional information regarding these provisions.


   2a. UPTIME and LOAD Averages
       This portion consists of a single line containing:
           program or window name, depending on display mode
           current time and length of time since last boot
           total number of users
           system load avg over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes


   2b. TASK and CPU States
       This portion consists of a minimum of two lines.  In an SMP  environment,
       additional lines can reflect individual CPU state percentages.

       Line  1  shows  total  tasks  or  threads,  depending on the state of the
       Threads-mode toggle.  That total is further classified as:
           running; sleeping; stopped; zombie

       Line 2 shows CPU state percentages based on the interval since  the  last
       refresh.   Where two labels are shown below, those for more recent kernel
       versions are shown first.
           us, user    : time running un-niced user processes
           sy, system  : time running kernel processes
           ni, nice    : time running niced user processes
           wa, IO-wait : time waiting for I/O completion
           hi : time spent servicing hardware interrupts
           si : time spent servicing software interrupts
           st : time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor


   2c. MEMORY Usage
       This portion consists of two lines which may express values in  kibibytes
       (KiB), mebibytes (MiB) or gibibytes (GiB) depending on the amount of cur&#8208;
       rently installed physical memory.

       Line 1 reflects physical memory, classified as:
           total, used, free, buffers

       Line 2 reflects virtual memory, classified as:
           total, used, free, cached


3. FIELDS / Columns
   3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields
       Listed below are top&apos;s available  process  fields  (columns).   They  are
       shown  in  alphabetical  order.   You  may  customize  their position and
       whether or not they are displayable with the &apos;f&apos; or &apos;F&apos;  (Fields  Manage&#8208;
       ment) interactive commands.

       Any  field  is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether they
       are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high.   For  additional  information  on
       sort provisions see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING.


        1. CGROUPS  --  Control Groups
           The  names of the control group(s) to which a process belongs, or &apos;-&apos;
           if not applicable for that process.

           Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory, network
           bandwidth,  etc.)  among  installation-defined  groups  of processes.
           They enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritiz&#8208;
           ing, managing and monitoring those resources.

           Many  different  hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a
           system and each hierarchy is attached to one or more  subsystems.   A
           subsystem represents a single resource.

           Note:  The  &apos;CGROUPS&apos; field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
           When displayed, it plus any other  variable  width  columns  will  be
           allocated  all  remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 charac&#8208;
           ters).


        2. CODE  --  Code Size (KiB)
           The amount of physical memory devoted to executable code, also  known
           as the &apos;text resident set&apos; size or TRS.


        3. COMMAND  --  Command Name or Command Line
           Display  the  command  line  used  to start a task or the name of the
           associated program.  You toggle between command line  and  name  with
           &apos;c&apos;, which is both a command-line option and an interactive command.

           When you&apos;ve chosen to display command lines, processes without a com&#8208;
           mand line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only  the  program
           name in brackets, as in this example:
               [ mdrecoveryd ]

           Either form of display is subject to potential truncation if it&apos;s too
           long to fit in this field&apos;s current width.  That width  depends  upon
           other fields selected, their order and the current screen width.

           This  field  may  also be impacted by the &apos;forest view&apos; display mode.
           See the &apos;V&apos; interactive command for additional information  regarding
           that mode.

           Note:  The  &apos;COMMAND&apos; field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
           When displayed, it plus any other  variable  width  columns  will  be
           allocated  all  remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 charac&#8208;
           ters).


        4. %CPU  --  CPU Usage
           The task&apos;s share of the  elapsed  CPU  time  since  the  last  screen
           update,  expressed  as a percentage of total CPU time.  In a true SMP
           environment, if &apos;Irix mode&apos; is Off,  top  will  operate  in  &apos;Solaris
           mode&apos; where a task&apos;s cpu usage will be divided by the total number of
           CPUs.  You toggle &apos;Irix/Solaris&apos; modes with the &apos;I&apos; interactive  com&#8208;
           mand.


        5. DATA  --  Data + Stack Size (KiB)
           The  amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable code,
           also known as the &apos;data resident set&apos; size or DRS.


        6. Flags  --  Task Flags
           This column represents the task&apos;s current scheduling flags which  are
           expressed  in  hexadecimal notation and with zeros suppressed.  These
           flags are officially documented in &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;.


        7. GID  --  Group Id
           The effective group ID.


        8. GROUP  --  Group Name
           The effective group name.


        9. %MEM  --  Memory Usage (RES)
           A task&apos;s currently used share of available physical memory.


       10. NI  --  Nice Value
           The nice value of the task.  A negative nice value means higher  pri&#8208;
           ority,  whereas  a positive nice value means lower priority.  Zero in
           this field simply means priority will not be adjusted in  determining
           a task&apos;s dispatch-ability.


       11. nDRT  --  Dirty Pages Count
           The  number  of  pages  that  have been modified since they were last
           written to auxiliary storage.  Dirty pages must be written to  auxil&#8208;
           iary storage before the corresponding physical memory location can be
           used for some other virtual page.
&#12;
       12. nMaj  --  Major Page Fault Count
           The number of major page faults that have occurred  for  a  task.   A
           page  fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a
           virtual page that is not currently present in its address  space.   A
           major page fault is when auxiliary storage access is involved in mak&#8208;
           ing that page available.


       13. nMin  --  Minor Page Fault count
           The number of minor page faults that have occurred  for  a  task.   A
           page  fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a
           virtual page that is not currently present in its address  space.   A
           minor  page fault does not involve auxiliary storage access in making
           that page available.


       14. nTH  --  Number of Threads
           The number of threads associated with a process.


       15. P  --  Last used CPU (SMP)
           A number representing the last used processor.  In a true  SMP  envi&#8208;
           ronment  this  will  likely change frequently since the kernel inten&#8208;
           tionally uses weak affinity.  Also, the very act of running  top  may
           break this weak affinity and cause more processes to change CPUs more
           often (because of the extra demand for cpu time).


       16. PGRP  --  Process Group Id
           Every process is member of a unique process group which is  used  for
           distribution  of  signals  and by terminals to arbitrate requests for
           their input and output.  When  a  process  is  created  (forked),  it
           becomes  a member of the process group of its parent.  By convention,
           this value equals the process ID (see PID) of the first member  of  a
           process group, called the process group leader.


       17. PID  --  Process Id
           The  task&apos;s unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though never
           restarting at zero.  In kernel terms, it  is  a  dispatchable  entity
           defined by a &apos;task_struct&apos;.

           This value may also be used as: a process group ID (see PGRP); a ses&#8208;
           sion ID for the session leader (see SID); a thread group ID  for  the
           thread  group  leader  (see TGID); and a TTY process group ID for the
           process group leader (see TPGID).


       18. PPID  --  Parent Process Id
           The process ID (pid) of a task&apos;s parent.


       19. PR  --  Priority
           The scheduling priority of the task.  If you see &apos;rt&apos; in this  field,
           it means the task is running under &apos;real time&apos; scheduling priority.

           Under  linux,  real time priority is somewhat misleading since tradi&#8208;
           tionally the operating itself was not preemptable.  And while the 2.6
           kernel can be made mostly preemptable, it is not always so.


       20. RES  --  Resident Memory Size (KiB)
           The non-swapped physical memory a task has used.
&#12;       21. RUID  --  Real User Id
           The real user ID.


       22. RUSER  --  Real User Name
           The real user name.


       23. S  --  Process Status
           The status of the task which can be one of:
               &apos;D&apos; = uninterruptible sleep
               &apos;R&apos; = running
               &apos;S&apos; = sleeping
               &apos;T&apos; = traced or stopped
               &apos;Z&apos; = zombie

           Tasks  shown  as running should be more properly thought of as &apos;ready
           to run&apos;  --  their task_struct is simply  represented  on  the  Linux
           run-queue.   Even  without  a  true SMP machine, you may see numerous
           tasks in this state depending on top&apos;s delay interval and nice value.


       24. SHR  --  Shared Memory Size (KiB)
           The amount of shared memory available to a task, not all of which  is
           typically  resident.   It simply reflects memory that could be poten&#8208;
           tially shared with other processes.


       25. SID  --  Session Id
           A session is a collection  of  process  groups  (see  PGRP),  usually
           established  by  the  login  shell.  A newly forked process joins the
           session of its creator.  By convention, this value equals the process
           ID  (see  PID) of the first member of the session, called the session
           leader, which is usually the login shell.


       26. SUID  --  Saved User Id
           The saved user ID.


       27. SUPGIDS  --  Supplementary Group IDs
           The IDs of any supplementary group(s) established at login or  inher&#8208;
           ited  from  a task&apos;s parent.  They are displayed in a comma delimited
           list.

           Note: The &apos;SUPGIDS&apos; field, unlike most columns, is  not  fixed-width.
           When  displayed,  it  plus  any  other variable width columns will be
           allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum  512  charac&#8208;
           ters).


       28. SUPGRPS  --  Supplementary Group Names
           The  names  of  any  supplementary  group(s)  established at login or
           inherited from a task&apos;s parent.  They are displayed in a comma delim&#8208;
           ited list.

           Note:  The  &apos;SUPGRPS&apos; field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
           When displayed, it plus any other  variable  width  columns  will  be
           allocated  all  remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 charac&#8208;
           ters).


       29. SUSER  --  Saved User Name
           The saved user name.
&#12;       30. SWAP  --  Swapped Size (KiB)
           The non-resident portion of a task&apos;s address space.


       31. TGID  --  Thread Group Id
           The ID of the thread group to which a task belongs.  It is the PID of
           the  thread group leader.  In kernel terms, it represents those tasks
           that share an &apos;mm_struct&apos;.


       32. TIME  --  CPU Time
           Total CPU time the task has used since it started.  When  &apos;Cumulative
           mode&apos; is On, each process is listed with the cpu time that it and its
           dead children have used.  You  toggle  &apos;Cumulative  mode&apos;  with  &apos;S&apos;,
           which  is both a command-line option and an interactive command.  See
           the &apos;S&apos; interactive command for additional information regarding this
           mode.


       33. TIME+  --  CPU Time, hundredths
           The  same  as  &apos;TIME&apos;,  but  reflecting more granularity through hun&#8208;
           dredths of a second.


       34. TPGID  --  Tty Process Group Id
           The process group ID of the foreground process for the connected tty,
           or  -1  if  a process is not connected to a terminal.  By convention,
           this value equals the process ID (see PID) of the the  process  group
           leader (see PGRP).


       35. TTY  --  Controlling Tty
           The  name  of  the  controlling terminal.  This is usually the device
           (serial port, pty, etc.) from which  the  process  was  started,  and
           which it uses for input or output.  However, a task need not be asso&#8208;
           ciated with a terminal, in which case you&apos;ll see &apos;?&apos; displayed.


       36. UID  --  User Id
           The effective user ID of the task&apos;s owner.


       37. USER  --  User Name
           The effective user name of the task&apos;s owner.


       38. VIRT  --  Virtual Memory Size (KiB)
           The total amount of virtual memory used by the task.  It includes all
           code, data and shared libraries plus pages that have been swapped out
           and pages that have been mapped but not used.


       39. WCHAN  --  Sleeping in Function
           Depending on the availability of the kernel link map  (&apos;System.map&apos;),
           this  field  will show the name or the address of the kernel function
           in which the task is currently sleeping.  Running tasks will  display
           a dash (&apos;-&apos;) in this column.

           By displaying this field, top&apos;s own working set could be increased by
           over 700Kb, depending on the kernel version.  Should that occur, your
           only means of reducing that overhead will be to stop and restart top.

           Note:  The  &apos;WCHAN&apos;  field,  unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
           When displayed, it plus any other  variable  width  columns  will  be
           allocated  all  remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512 charac&#8208;
           ters).


   3b. MANAGING Fields
       After pressing the interactive command &apos;f&apos; or &apos;F&apos; (Fields Management) you
       will be presented with a screen showing: 1) the &#180;current&#180; window name; 2)
       the designated sort field; 3) all fields in  their  current  order  along
       with  descriptions.   Entries  marked  with an asterisk are the currently
       displayed fields, screen width permitting.


           o  As the on screen instructions indicate,  you  navigate  among  the
              fields  with the Up and Down arrow keys.  The PgUp, PgDn, Home and
              End keys can also be used to  quickly  reach  the  first  or  last
              available field.


           o  The Right arrow key selects a field for repositioning and the Left
              arrow key or the &lt;Enter&gt; key commits that field&apos;s placement.


           o  The &apos;d&apos; key or the &lt;Space&gt; bar toggles a field&apos;s  display  status,
              and thus the presence or absence of the asterisk.


           o  The  &apos;s&apos;  key designates a field as the sort field.  See topic 4c.
              TASK AREA Commands, SORTING for additional  information  regarding
              your selection of a sort field.


           o  The  &apos;a&apos;  and  &apos;w&apos; keys can be used to cycle through all available
              windows and the &apos;q&apos; or &lt;Esc&gt; keys exit Fields Management.


       The Fields Management screen can also be used  to  change  the  &#180;current&#180;
       window/field  group in either full-screen mode or alternate-display mode.
       Whatever was targeted when &apos;q&apos; or &lt;Esc&gt; was pressed will be made  current
       as  you return to the top display.  See topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provi&#8208;
       sions and the &apos;g&apos; interactive command for insight into &#180;current&#180;  windows
       and field groups.


       Note: Any window that has been scrolled horizontally will be reset if any
       field changes are made via the Fields Management  screen.   Any  vertical
       scrolled  position,  however,  will  not  be  affected.   See  topic  5c.
       SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding vertical and hor&#8208;
       izontal scrolling.


4. INTERACTIVE Commands
       Listed  below  is a brief index of commands within categories.  Some com&#8208;
       mands appear more than once  --  their meaning or scope may vary  depend&#8208;
       ing on the context in which they are issued.

         4a. Global-Commands
               &lt;Ent/Sp&gt; ?, =, A, B, d, g, h, H, I, k, q, r, s, W, Z
         4b. Summary-Area-Commands

         5d. Searching-in-a-Window
               L, &amp;


   4a. GLOBAL Commands
       The  global interactive commands are always available in both full-screen
       mode and alternate-display mode.  However, some of these interactive com&#8208;
       mands are not available when running in &apos;Secure mode&apos;.

       If  you wish to know in advance whether or not your top has been secured,
       simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.


         &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Space&gt; :Refresh-Display
              These commands awaken top and following receipt of any  input  the
              entire  display  will  be repainted.  They also force an update of
              any hotplugged cpu or physical memory changes.

              Use either of these keys if you have a large  delay  interval  and
              wish to see current status,


         &#180;?&#180; | &#180;h&#180; :Help
              There  are  two  help  levels available.  The first will provide a
              reminder of  all  the  basic  interactive  commands.   If  top  is
              secured, that screen will be abbreviated.

              Typing  &apos;h&apos;  or  &apos;?&apos; on that help screen will take you to help for
              those interactive commands applicable to alternate-display mode.


         &#180;=&#180; :Exit-Task-Limits
              Removes restrictions on which tasks are shown.  This command  will
              reverse  any  &apos;i&apos;  (idle  tasks) and &apos;n&apos; (max tasks) commands that
              might be active.  It also provides for an &apos;exit&apos; from pid monitor&#8208;
              ing  and  user  filtering.  See the &apos;-p&apos; command-line option for a
              discussion of PID monitoring and the &apos;U&apos; or &apos;u&apos;  interactive  com&#8208;
              mands regarding user filtering.

              Additionally, any window that has been scrolled will be reset with
              this command.  See topic 5c. SCROLLING  a  Window  for  additional
              information regarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.

              When  operating  in  alternate-display  mode  this  command  has a
              broader meaning.


         &#180;A&#180; :Alternate-Display-Mode toggle
              This command will  switch  between  full-screen  mode  and  alter&#8208;
              nate-display  mode.  See topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and
              the &apos;g&apos; interactive command for insight into &#180;current&#180; windows and
              field groups.


         &#180;B&#180; :Bold-Disable/Enable toggle
              This  command will influence use of the &apos;bold&apos; terminfo capability
              and alters both the summary area and task area for  the  &#180;current&#180;
              window.   While  it is intended primarily for use with dumb termi&#8208;
              nals, it can be applied anytime.

              Note: When this toggle is On and top is  operating  in  monochrome
              mode, the entire display will appear as normal text.  Thus, unless
              the &apos;x&apos; and/or &apos;y&apos; toggles are using reverse for  emphasis,  there
              will be no visual confirmation that they are even on.


       * &#180;d&#180; | &#180;s&#180; :Change-Delay-Time-interval
              You  will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between
              display updates.

              Fractional seconds are honored,  but  a  negative  number  is  not
              allowed.   Entering  0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an
              unsatisfactory display as the system and tty driver try to keep up
              with  top&apos;s demands.  The delay value is inversely proportional to
              system loading, so set it with care.

              If at any time you wish to know the current delay time, simply ask
              for help and view the system summary on the second line.


         &#180;g&#180; :Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group
              You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating
              the field group which should be made the  &#180;current&#180;  window.   You
              will  soon grow comfortable with these 4 windows, especially after
              experimenting with alternate-display mode.


         &#180;H&#180; :Threads-mode toggle
              When this toggle is On, individual threads will be  displayed  for
              all  processes  in  all visible task windows.  Otherwise, top dis&#8208;
              plays a summation of all threads in each process.


         &#180;I&#180; :Irix/Solaris-Mode toggle
              When operating in &apos;Solaris mode&apos; (&apos;I&apos; toggled Off), a  task&apos;s  cpu
              usage  will be divided by the total number of CPUs.  After issuing
              this command, you&apos;ll be told the new state of this toggle.


       * &#180;k&#180; :Kill-a-task
              You will be prompted for a PID and then the signal to  send.   The
              default  signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM.  However,
              you can send any signal, via number or name.

              If you wish to abort the kill process, do  one  of  the  following
              depending on your progress:
                  1) at the pid prompt, just press &lt;Enter&gt;
                  2) at the signal prompt, type 0


         &#180;q&#180; :Quit


       * &#180;r&#180; :Renice-a-Task
              You  will  be prompted for a PID and then the value to nice it to.
              Entering a positive value will cause a process to  lose  priority.
              Conversely,  a  negative  value  will cause a process to be viewed
              more favorably by the kernel.


         &#180;W&#180; :Write-the-Configuration-File
              This will save all of your options and toggles  plus  the  current
              display  mode and delay time.  By issuing this command just before
              quitting top, you will be able restart later in exactly that  same
              state.


         &#180;Z&#180; :Change-Color-Mapping
              This  key  will take you to a separate screen where you can change
              the colors for the &#180;current&#180; window,  or  for  all  windows.   For
              details  regarding  this  interactive  command see topic 4d. COLOR
              Mapping.


       *  The commands shown with an asterisk (&#180;*&#180;) are not available in &apos;Secure
          mode&apos;, nor will they be shown on the level-1 help screen.


   4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands
       The  summary  area  interactive  commands  are  always  available in both
       full-screen mode and alternate-display mode.  They affect  the  beginning
       lines  of  your  display  and will determine the position of messages and
       prompts.

       These commands always impact just the &#180;current&#180; window/field group.   See
       topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the &apos;g&apos; interactive command for
       insight into &#180;current&#180; windows and field groups.


         &#180;l&#180; :Load-Average/Uptime toggle
              This is also the line containing the  program  name  (possibly  an
              alias)  when operating in full-screen mode or the &#180;current&#180; window
              name when operating in alternate-display mode.


         &#180;t&#180; :Task/Cpu-States toggle
              This command affects from 2 to many summary area lines,  depending
              on  the  state of the &apos;1&apos; toggle and whether or not top is running
              under true SMP.

              This portion of the summary area is also  influenced  by  the  &apos;H&apos;
              interactive  command toggle, as reflected in the total label which
              shows either &apos;Tasks&apos; or &apos;Threads&apos;.


         &#180;1&#180; :Single/Separate-Cpu-States toggle
              This command affects how the &apos;t&apos; command&apos;s Cpu States  portion  is
              shown.   Although this toggle exists primarily to serve massively-
              parallel SMP machines, it is not restricted to solely SMP environ&#8208;
              ments.

              When  you see &apos;%Cpu(s):&apos; in the summary area, the &apos;1&apos; toggle is On
              and all cpu information is gathered in a single line.   Otherwise,
              each  cpu  is  displayed separately as: &apos;%Cpu0, %Cpu1, ...&apos;  up to
              available screen height.


         &#180;m&#180; :Memory/Swap-Usage toggle
              This command affects the two summary area lines dealing with phys&#8208;
              ical and virtual memory.


       Note: If the entire summary area has been toggled Off for any window, you
       would be left with just the message line.  In that  way,  you  will  have
       maximized  available  task  rows but (temporarily) sacrificed the program
       name in full-screen mode or the &#180;current&#180;  window  name  when  in  alter&#8208;
       nate-display mode.


   4c. TASK AREA Commands
       The  task  area  interactive commands are always available in full-screen
       mode.

       The task area interactive commands are never available in  alternate-dis&#8208;
       play  mode  if  the  &#180;current&#180; window&apos;s task display has been toggled Off
       (see topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions).


       APPEARANCE of task window
         The following commands will also be influenced  by  the  state  of  the
         global &apos;B&apos; (bold enable) toggle.


         &#180;b&#180; :Bold/Reverse toggle
              This  command  will  impact  how  the &apos;x&apos; and &apos;y&apos; toggles are dis&#8208;
              played.  Further, it will only be available when at least  one  of
              those toggles is On.


         &#180;x&#180; :Column-Highlight toggle
              Changes  highlighting  for  the current sort field.  If you forget
              which field is being sorted this command can serve as a quick vis&#8208;
              ual  reminder,  providing  the sort field is being displayed.  The
              sort field might not be visible because:
                  1) there is insufficient Screen Width
                  2) the &apos;f&apos; interactive command turned it Off


         &#180;y&#180; :Row-Highlight toggle
              Changes highlighting for &quot;running&quot; tasks.  For additional  insight
              into  this  task  state, see topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields, the
              &apos;S&apos; field (Process Status).

              Use of this provision provides important insight  into  your  sys&#8208;
              tem&apos;s  health.  The only costs will be a few additional tty escape
              sequences.


         &#180;z&#180; :Color/Monochrome toggle
              Switches the &#180;current&#180; window between your last used color  scheme
              and the older form of black-on-white or white-on-black.  This com&#8208;
              mand will alter both the summary area and task area but  does  not
              affect the state of the &apos;x&apos;, &apos;y&apos; or &apos;b&apos; toggles.


       CONTENT of task window
         &#180;c&#180; :Command-Line/Program-Name toggle
              This  command  will be honored whether or not the &apos;COMMAND&apos; column
              is currently visible.  Later, should that field  come  into  view,
              the change you applied will be seen.

         &#180;f&#180; | &#180;F&#180; :Fields-Management
              These  keys  display  a separate screen where you can change which
              fields are displayed, their order  and  also  designate  the  sort
              field.   For  additional information on these interactive commands
              see topic 3b. MANAGING Fields.

         &#180;S&#180; :Cumulative-Time-Mode toggle
              When &apos;Cumulative mode&apos; is On, each process is listed with the  cpu
              time that it and its dead children have used.

              When  Off, programs that fork into many separate tasks will appear
              less demanding.  For programs like  &apos;init&apos;  or  a  shell  this  is
              appropriate  but for others, like compilers, perhaps not.  Experi&#8208;
              ment with two task windows sharing the same sort  field  but  with
              different &apos;S&apos; states and see which representation you prefer.

              After issuing this command, you&apos;ll be informed of the new state of
              this toggle.  If you wish to know in advance whether or not &apos;Cumu&#8208;
              lative mode&apos; is in effect, simply ask for help and view the window
              summary on the second line.
&#12;         &#180;u&apos; | &apos;U&apos; :Show-Specific-User-Only
              You will be prompted for the uid or name of the user  to  display.
              The &apos;-u&apos; option matches on  effective user whereas the &apos;-U&apos; option
              matches on any user (real, effective, saved, or filesystem).

              Thereafter, in that task window only matching users will be shown,
              or  possibly  no  processes will be shown.  Different task windows
              can can be used to filter different users.

              Later, if you wish to monitor all tasks  again  in  the  &#180;current&#180;
              window,  re-issue  this  command  but  just  press  &lt;Enter&gt; at the
              prompt.

         &#180;V&apos; :Forest-View-Mode toggle
              In this mode, processes are reordered according to  their  parents
              and the layout of the COMMAND column resembles that of a tree.  In
              forest view mode it is still possible to  toggle  between  program
              name and commamd line (see the &apos;c&apos; interactive command) or between
              processes and threads (see the &apos;H&apos; interactive command).

              Note: Typing any key affecting the sort  order  will  exit  forest
              view  mode  in the &#180;current&#180; window.  See topic 4c. TASK AREA Com&#8208;
              mands, SORTING for information on those keys.

       SIZE of task window
         &#180;i&#180; :Idle-Process toggle
              Displays all tasks or just active tasks.  When this toggle is Off,
              tasks that have not used any CPU since the last update will not be
              displayed.  However, due to the granularity of the %CPU and  TIME+
              fields,  some processes may still be displayed that appear to have
              used no CPU.

              If this command is applied to the last task display when in alter&#8208;
              nate-display  mode,  then it will not affect the window&apos;s size, as
              all prior task displays will have already been painted.

         &#180;n&#180; | &#180;#&#180; :Set-Maximum-Tasks
              You will be prompted to enter the number of tasks to display.  The
              lessor of your number and available screen rows will be used.

              When  used  in  alternate-display  mode,  this is the command that
              gives you precise control over the size of each currently  visible
              task  display,  except  for the very last.  It will not affect the
              last window&apos;s size, as all prior task displays will  have  already
              been painted.

              Note:  If  you  wish to increase the size of the last visible task
              display when in alternate-display mode, simply decrease  the  size
              of the task display(s) above it.

       SORTING of task window
         For  compatibility, this top supports most of the former top sort keys.
         Since this is primarily a service to former top users,  these  commands
         do not appear on any help screen.
            command   sorted-field                  supported
              A         start time (non-display)      No
              M         %MEM                          Yes
              N         PID                           Yes
              P         %CPU                          Yes
              T         TIME+                         Yes

         Before  using  any  of the following sort provisions, top suggests that
         you temporarily turn on column highlighting using the  &apos;x&apos;  interactive
         command.   That  will  help  ensure  that  the  actual sort environment
         matches your intent.
&#12;         The following interactive commands will only be honored when  the  cur&#8208;
         rent  sort  field  is  visible.   The  sort  field might not be visible
         because:
              1) there is insufficient Screen Width
              2) the &apos;f&apos; interactive command turned it Off

         &#180;&lt;&#180; :Move-Sort-Field-Left
              Moves the sort column to the left unless the current sort field is
              the first field being displayed.

         &#180;&gt;&#180; :Move-Sort-Field-Right
              Moves  the  sort column to the right unless the current sort field
              is the last field being displayed.

         The following interactive commands will always be  honored  whether  or
         not the current sort field is visible.

         &#180;f&#180; | &#180;F&#180; :Fields-Management
              These  keys  display  a separate screen where you can change which
              field is used as the sort column, among other functions.  This can
              be  a convenient way to simply verify the current sort field, when
              running top with column highlighting turned Off.

         &#180;R&#180; :Reverse/Normal-Sort-Field toggle
              Using this interactive command you can alternate between  high-to-
              low and low-to-high sorts.

         Note:  Field sorting uses internal values, not those in column display.
         Thus, the TTY and WCHAN fields  will  violate  strict  ASCII  collating
         sequence.

   4d. COLOR Mapping
       When  you issue the &apos;Z&apos; interactive command, you will be presented with a
       separate screen.  That screen can be used to change the  colors  in  just
       the  &#180;current&#180;  window or in all four windows before returning to the top
       display.

       The following interactive commands are available.
           4 upper case letters to select a target
           8 numbers to select a color
           normal toggles available
               &apos;B&apos;       :bold disable/enable
               &apos;b&apos;       :running tasks &quot;bold&quot;/reverse
               &apos;z&apos;       :color/mono
           other commands available
               &apos;a&apos;/&apos;w&apos;   :apply, then go to next/prior
               &lt;Enter&gt;   :apply and exit
               &apos;q&apos;       :abandon current changes and exit

       If you use &apos;a&apos; or &apos;w&apos; to cycle the targeted window, you will have applied
       the  color scheme that was displayed when you left that window.  You can,
       of course, easily return to any window and reapply  different  colors  or
       turn colors Off completely with the &apos;z&apos; toggle.

       The  Color  Mapping  screen can also be used to change the &#180;current&#180; win&#8208;
       dow/field group in either full-screen  mode  or  alternate-display  mode.
       Whatever  was  targeted when &apos;q&apos; or &lt;Enter&gt; was pressed will be made cur&#8208;
       rent as you return to the top display.

5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions
   5a. WINDOWS Overview
       Field Groups/Windows:
          In full-screen mode there is a single window represented by the entire
          screen.   That  single  window  can still be changed to display 1 of 4
          different field groups (see  the  &apos;g&apos;  interactive  command,  repeated
          below).   Each  of  the 4 field groups has a unique separately config&#8208;
          urable summary area and its own configurable task area.

          In alternate-display mode, those 4 underlying field groups can now  be
          made visible simultaneously, or can be turned Off individually at your
          command.

          The summary area will always exist, even  if  it&apos;s  only  the  message
          line.  At any given time only one summary area can be displayed.  How&#8208;
          ever, depending on your commands, there could be  from  zero  to  four
          separate task displays currently showing on the screen.

       Current Window:
          The  &#180;current&#180;  window  is the window associated with the summary area
          and the window to which task related  commands  are  always  directed.
          Since  in  alternate-display mode you can toggle the task display Off,
          some commands might be restricted for the &#180;current&#180; window.

          A further complication arises when you have toggled the first  summary
          area  line  Off.   With  the  loss of the window name (the &apos;l&apos; toggled
          line), you&apos;ll not easily know what window is the &#180;current&#180; window.

   5b. COMMANDS for Windows
         &#180;-&#180; | &#180;_&#180; :Show/Hide-Window(s) toggles
              The &apos;-&apos; key turns the &#180;current&#180; window&apos;s task display On and  Off.
              When  On, that task area will show a minimum of the columns header
              you&apos;ve established with the &apos;f&apos; interactive command.  It will also
              reflect  any other task area options/toggles you&apos;ve applied yield&#8208;
              ing zero or more tasks.

              The &apos;_&apos; key does the same for all task displays.  In other  words,
              it  switches between the currently visible task display(s) and any
              task display(s) you had toggled Off.  If all 4 task  displays  are
              currently visible, this interactive command will leave the summary
              area as the only display element.

       * &#180;=&#180; | &#180;+&#180; :Equalize-(re-balance)-Window(s)
              The &apos;=&apos; key forces the &#180;current&#180; window&apos;s task display to be visi&#8208;
              ble.   It  also reverses any &apos;i&apos; (idle tasks), &apos;n&apos; (max tasks) and
              &apos;u&apos;/&apos;U&apos; (user filter) commands that might be active.  Also, if the
              window had been scrolled, it will be reset with this command.  See
              topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information  regarding
              vertical and horizontal scrolling.

              The &apos;+&apos; key does the same for all windows.  The four task displays
              will reappear, evenly balanced.  They will also have retained  any
              customizations  you  had  previously  applied,  except for the &apos;i&apos;
              (idle tasks), &apos;n&apos; (max tasks), &apos;u&apos;/&apos;U&apos; (user filter) and scrolling
              interactive commands.

       * &#180;A&#180; :Alternate-Display-Mode toggle
              This  command  will  switch  between  full-screen  mode and alter&#8208;
              nate-display mode.

              The first time you issue this command, all four task displays will
              be shown.  Thereafter when you switch modes, you will see only the
              task display(s) you&apos;ve chosen to make visible.

       * &#180;a&#180; | &#180;w&#180; :Next-Window-Forward/Backward
              This will change the &#180;current&#180; window, which in turn  changes  the
              window to which commands are directed.  These keys act in a circu&#8208;
              lar fashion so you can reach any desired  &#180;current&#180;  window  using
              either key.

              Assuming  the  window  name  is  visible (you have not toggled &apos;l&apos;
              Off), whenever the &#180;current&#180; window name loses its emphasis/color,
              that&apos;s  a  reminder the task display is Off and many commands will
              be restricted.

       * &#180;g&#180; :Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group
              You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating
              the field group which should be made the &#180;current&#180; window.

              In  full-screen mode, this command is necessary to alter the &#180;cur&#8208;
              rent&#180; window.  In alternate-display mode, it is simply a less con&#8208;
              venient alternative to the &apos;a&apos; and &apos;w&apos; commands.

         &#180;G&#180; :Change-Window/Field-Group-Name
              You will be prompted for a new name to be applied to the &#180;current&#180;
              window.  It does not require that the window name be visible  (the
              &apos;l&apos; toggle to be On).

       *  The  interactive commands shown with an asterisk (&#180;*&#180;) have use beyond
          alternate-display mode.
              &#180;=&apos;, &apos;A&apos;, &apos;g&apos;  are always available
              &#180;a&apos;, &apos;w&apos;       act the same with color mapping
                             and fields management

   5c. SCROLLING a Window
       Typically a task  window  is  a  partial  view  into  a  systems&apos;s  total
       tasks/threads  which  shows  only  some  of the available fields/columns.
       With these scrolling keys, you can move that view vertically or  horizon&#8208;
       tally to reveal any desired task or column.

       Up,PgUp :Scroll-Tasks
           Move  the  view up toward the first task row, until the first task is
           displayed at the top of the &#180;current&#180; window.  The Up arrow key moves
           a single line while PgUp scrolls the entire window.

       Down,PgDn :Scroll-Tasks
           Move  the  view down toward the last task row, until the last task is
           the only task displayed at the top of the &#180;current&#180; window.  The Down
           arrow key moves a single line while PgDn scrolls the entire window.

       Left,Right :Scroll-Columns
           Move  the  view  of  displayable  fields horizontally one column at a
           time.

           Note: As a reminder, some  fields/columns  are  not  fixed-width  but
           allocated  all  remaining  screen width when visible.  When scrolling
           right or left, that feature may produce some unexpected results  ini&#8208;
           tially.

       Home :Jump-to-Home-Position
           Reposition the display to the un-scrolled coordinates.

       End :Jump-to-End-Position
           Reposition the display so that the rightmost column reflects the last
           displayable field and the bottom task row represents the last task.

           Note: From this position it is still  possible  to  scroll  down  and
           right using the arrow keys.  This is true until a single column and a
           single task is left as the only display element.

       &apos;C&apos; :Show-scroll-coordinates toggle
           Toggle an informational message which is displayed whenever the  mes&#8208;
           sage line is not otherwise being used.

               &quot;scroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)&quot;

           The coordinates shown as n/n are relative to the upper left corner of
           the &#180;current&#180; window.
&#12;           y = n/n (tasks)
               The first n represents the topmost visible task and is controlled
               by  scrolling  keys.   The  second  n is updated automatically to
               reflect total tasks.

           x = n/n (fields)
               The first n represents the leftmost displayed column and is  con&#8208;
               trolled  by  scrolling keys.  The second n is the total number of
               displayable fields and is established with  the  &apos;f&apos;  interactive
               command.

       The  above  interactive commands are always available in full-screen mode
       but never available in alternate-display mode if the  &#180;current&#180;  window&apos;s
       task display has been toggled Off.

   5d. SEARCHING in a Window
       You  can use these interactive commands to locate a task row containing a
       particular value.

       &apos;L&#180; :Locate-a-string
           You will be prompted for the case-sensitive string to locate starting
           from  the  current  window coordinates.  There are no restrictions on
           search string content.

           Searches are not limited to values from a  single  field  or  column.
           All  of  the  values  displayed in a task row are allowed in a search
           string.  You may include spaces, numbers,  symbols  and  even  forest
           view artwork.

           Keying  &lt;Enter&gt;  with  no  input will effectively disable the &apos;&amp;&apos; key
           until a new search string is entered.

       &apos;&amp;&#180; :Locate-next
           Assuming a search string has been established, top  will  attempt  to
           locate the next occurrence.

       When  a  match is found, the current window is repositioned vertically so
       the task row containing that string is  first.   The  scroll  coordinates
       message  can provide confirmation of such vertical repositioning (see the
       &apos;C&apos;  interactive  command).   Horizontal  scrolling,  however,  is  never
       altered via searching.

       The availability of a matching string will be influenced by the following
       factors.
          a. Which fields are displayable from the total available,
             see topic 3b. MANAGING Fields.
          b. Scrolling a window vertically and/or horizontally,
             see topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window.
          c. The state of the command/command-line toggle,
             see the &apos;c&apos; interactive command.
          d. The stability of the chosen sort column,
             for example PID is good but %CPU bad.

       If a search fails, restoring the &#180;current&#180; window home (unscrolled) posi&#8208;
       tion, scrolling horizontally, displaying command-lines or choosing a more
       stable sort field could yet produce a successful &apos;&amp;&apos; search.

       The above interactive commands are always available in  full-screen  mode
       but  never  available in alternate-display mode if the &#180;current&#180; window&apos;s
       task display has been toggled Off.

       Note: Whenever a search key is typed, top forces idle tasks On  and  user
       filtering  Off to ensure that every task is encountered.  See the &apos;i&apos; and
       &apos;u/U&apos; interactive commands for additional information  on  how  displayed
       tasks might be filtered.
&#12;6. FILES
   6a. SYSTEM Configuration File
       The  presence  of  this  file  will influence which version of the &apos;help&apos;
       screen is shown to an ordinary user.  More  importantly,  it  will  limit
       what ordinary users are allowed to do when top is running.  They will not
       be able to issue the following commands.
           k        Kill a task
           r        Renice a task
           d or s   Change delay/sleep interval

       The system configuration file is not created by top.  Rather, you  create
       this  file manually and place it in the /etc directory.  Its name must be
       &apos;toprc&apos; and must have no leading &apos;.&apos; (period).  It  must  have  only  two
       lines.

       Here is an example of the contents of /etc/toprc:
           s        # line 1: &apos;secure&apos; mode switch
           5.0      # line 2: &apos;delay&apos;  interval in seconds

   6b. PERSONAL Configuration File
       This  file  is  written  as &apos;$HOME/.your-name-4-top&apos; + &apos;rc&apos;.  Use the &apos;W&apos;
       interactive command to create it or update it.

       Here is the general layout:
           global   # line 1: the program name/alias notation
             &quot;      # line 2: id,altscr,irixps,delay,curwin
           per ea   # line a: winname,fieldscur
           window   # line b: winflags,sortindx,maxtasks
             &quot;      # line c: summclr,msgsclr,headclr,taskclr

       If the $HOME variable is not present, top will try to write the  personal
       configuration file to the current directory, subject to permissions.

7. STUPID TRICKS Sampler
       Many  of  these  &apos;tricks&apos; work best when you give top a scheduling boost.
       So plan on starting him with a nice value of -10, assuming you&apos;ve got the
       authority.

   7a. Kernel Magic
       For these stupid tricks, top needs full-screen mode.

       o  The  user  interface,  through prompts and help, intentionally implies
          that the delay interval is limited to tenths of  a  second.   However,
          you&apos;re free to set any desired delay.  If you want to see Linux at his
          scheduling best, try a delay of .09 seconds or less.

          For this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm  and  maximize  it.
          Then do the following:
            . provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:
                nice -n -10 top -d.09
            . keep sorted column highlighting Off so as to
              minimize path length
            . turn On reverse row highlighting for emphasis
            . try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),
              and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most
              active processes into view

          What  you&apos;ll  see is a very busy Linux doing what he&apos;s always done for
          you, but there was no program available to illustrate this.

       o  Under an xterm using &apos;white-on-black&apos; colors, on top&apos;s  Color  Mapping
          screen  set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting
          is set to bold, not reverse.  Then set the delay interval to around .3
          seconds.

          After  bringing  the  most active processes into view, what you&apos;ll see
          are the ghostly images of just the currently running tasks.

       o  Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink.  Start  this  new
          version then type &apos;T&apos; (a secret key, see topic 4c. Task Area Commands,
          SORTING) followed by &apos;W&apos; and &apos;q&apos;.  Finally, restart the  program  with
          -d0 (zero delay).

          Your  display  will be refreshed at three times the rate of the former
          top, a 300% speed advantage.  As top climbs the  TIME  ladder,  be  as
          patient  as  you can while speculating on whether or not top will ever
          reach the top.

   7b. Bouncing Windows
       For these stupid tricks, top needs alternate-display mode.

       o  With 3 or 4 task displays visible, pick any window other than the last
          and  turn  idle processes Off using the &apos;i&apos; command toggle.  Depending
          on where you applied &apos;i&apos;, sometimes several task displays are bouncing
          and  sometimes  it&apos;s like an accordion, as top tries his best to allo&#8208;
          cate space.

       o  Set each window&apos;s summary lines differently: one with no memory (&apos;m&apos;);
          another  with no states (&apos;t&apos;); maybe one with nothing at all, just the
          message line.  Then hold down &apos;a&apos; or &apos;w&apos;  and  watch  a  variation  on
          bouncing windows  --  hopping windows.

       o  Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to Off
          using the &apos;i&apos;  command  toggle.   You&apos;ve  just  entered  the  &quot;extreme
          bounce&quot; zone.

   7c. The Big Bird Window
       This stupid trick also requires alternate-display mode.

       o  Display  all  4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the &#180;current&#180; win&#8208;
          dow.  Then, keep increasing window size with the &apos;n&apos; interactive  com&#8208;
          mand until all the other task displays are &quot;pushed out of the nest&quot;.

          When  they&apos;ve all been displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible
          windows using the &apos;_&apos; command toggle.  Then ponder this:
             is top fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?

9. HISTORY Former top
       The original top was written by Roger Binns, based on Branko  Lankester&apos;s
       &lt;lankeste@fwi.uva.nl&gt; ps program.

       Robert  Nation  &lt;nation@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com&gt;  adapted  it for the
       proc file system.

       Helmut Geyer &lt;Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de&gt; added support for  con&#8208;
       figurable fields.

       Plus many other individuals contributed over the years.
