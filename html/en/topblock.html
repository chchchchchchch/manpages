DESCRIPTION
       Creates a world of falling blocks that build up and up.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -delay number
               Per-frame delay, in  microseconds.   Default:  10000  (0.01  sec&#8208;
               onds.).

       -wireframe | -no-wireframe
               Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

       -size number
               Size of the base/carpet.

       -spawn number
               Likeyhood  of  a new block being created per frame : 1 high, 1000
               very low.

       -camX number
               Initial camera X location in the world.

       -camY number
               Initial camera Y location in the world.

       -camZ number
               Initial camera Z location in the world.

       -rotate | -no-rotate
               Add/Remove rotation to/from the animation.

       -no-carpet
               Remove the base/carpet.

       -no-nipples
               Remove nipples on the blocks (also applies  to  udders)  (has  no
               effect in blob mode).

       -blob   Run in blob mode, blocks become over sized spheres.

       -rotateSpeed number
               Varries speed of world rotation.
&#12;       -follow Camera  follows  blocks as they fall instead of camera being semi
               static (stays with top block).

       -maxFalling number
               Maximum number of objects created before recycling occurs.

       -resolution number
               Resolution of tubes, disks and spheres.

       -maxColors number
               Number of different colors available to falling objects.

       -dropSpeed number
               Varries speed of falling objects.

       -override
               Overrides camera settings and provides a tunnel view.


KEYS
       a       Increases viewing X coordinate.

       z       Decreases viewing X coordinate.

       s       Increases viewing Y coordinate.

       x       Decreases viewing Y coordinate.

       d       Increases viewing Z coordinate.

       c       Decreases viewing Z coordinate.

       f       Increases camera location X coordinate.

       v       Decreases camera location X coordinate.

       g       Increases camera location Y coordinate.

       b       Decreases camera location Y coordinate.

       h       Increases camera location Z coordinate.

       n       Decreases camera location Z coordinate.

       r       Increases world rotation.

       q       quit.

EXAMPLES
       To see which block follow-mode is tracking, set the number of block  col&#8208;
       ors to 1.

       topblock -follow -maxColors 1

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
