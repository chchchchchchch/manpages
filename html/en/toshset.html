TOSHSET(1)                   User-installed Software                  TOSHSET(1)



NAME
       toshset - manipulate bios and hardware settings of Toshiba laptops

SYNOPSIS
       toshset [TOGGLEOPTIONS | QUERYOPTIONS | FEATUREOPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       Toshset  ia  a  command-line  tool to allow access to much of the Toshiba
       hardware interface developed by Jonathan Buzzard. It can do  things  like
       set  the  hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display and set the fan
       speed.

       Credit for the difficult task of reverse-engineering the Toshiba hardware
       interface  goes  to  Jonathan  Buzzard.   A  link for Jonathan&apos;s tools is
       http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/

       All options are listed by running toshset with no arguments.

       If an argument option is specified as the ``-&apos;&apos; character, stdin is  read
       for  that  option. This is particularly convenient when setting the owner
       string.

       The method used for access to the laptop hardware is  given  by  the  the
       HCI/SCI  access  mode  query  field. This should be kernel or direct. The
       kernel method requires kernel support and it is the  only  access  method
       supported  for  ACPI  kernels.  If ACPI is not used this package does not
       require a special kernel module. Also, it is highly likely that this tool
       will  work  under  different  flavors of *NIX. As a result of this design
       consideration, and because of my own desire that not every user  be  able
       to  change  my  laptop&apos;s hardware settings, the user must have read/write
       permission to /dev/toshiba in order for this program to run properly.



   Toggle Options:
       -l     toggle long query in which the assocated  command-line  option  is
              printed with each queried feature.

       -fast  run  in  fast mode: a startup check is skipped, and values are not
              queried after the are set. On machines for which  ioctl  is  slow,
              this can speed toshset up by up to a factor of 2/5.

       -v     toggle verbose mode in which normally silent messages are printed.

   Query Options:
       -q  [glob]
              query  features  specified by glob (all features if glob omitted).
              The glob string is sandwiched between asterisks, so specifying  -q
              bat  will  query all features whose names contain the ``bat&apos;&apos; sub&#8208;
              string. If no glob is given, then all features are queried.

   Feature Options:
       Valid settings for features can be listed by omitting the  argument.  The
       current list of feature options is

       -b  &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable system beep

       -lcd &lt;setting&gt;
              set lcd brightness.

       -inten &lt;setting&gt;
              set lcd brightness. Not all models support both -lcd and -inten.
&#12;       -pow &lt;setting&gt;
              set power-up mode

       -vol &lt;0-4&gt;
              set  beep  volume. Note that this controls the modem volume for my
              PCMCIA modem.

       -hdd &lt;num&gt;
              number of minutes until disk spindown

       -dstretch &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable display stretch

       -d &lt;num&gt;
              number of minutes until display auto-off

       -c &lt;method&gt;
              set cooling method

       -bs &lt;setting&gt;
              set battery-save mode

       -bl &lt;off|on&gt;
              control lcd backlight

       -bluetooth &lt;off|on&gt;
              power-up + attach internal bluetooth device, or shutdown.

       -fan &lt;setting&gt;
              control fan

       -video &lt;int|ext|both|tv|mode5|mode6|mode7&gt;
              set display device for video: internal lcd, external  monitor,  or
              tv-out

       -cpu &lt;slow|fast&gt;
              set CPU speed

       -cpucache &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable CPU cache

       -sleep &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable CPU sleep mode

       -balarm &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable battery alarm

       -palarm &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable lid-closed alarm

       -walarm &lt;dis|HH:MM[/everyday|DD/MM[/YYYY]]&gt;
              set time/date to wake

       -ppower &lt;off|on&gt;
              enable/disable  annoying feature of powering-off computer when lid
              is closed.

       -parallel &lt;mode&gt;
              set parallel port mode

       -autooff &lt;num&gt;
              number of minutes of idle time until system auto-off

       -ostring &lt;owner string&gt;
              set owner string. This string is displayed at boot or resume time,
              if a user or supervisor password is set.

       -upasswd
              set or clear the user password. Toshset must be run on the console
              for this to work. The password should be entered when  the  prompt
              is  displayed.  If the password is currently set, entering it will
              clear the password.

       -spasswd
              set the supervisor password. See the docs for -upasswd.

       -usblegacy
              USB legacy mode: enable/disable using an USB mouse as it would  be
              a PS/2 one, without the need to install a USB driver.

       -3g    power-up + attach internal 3g modem device, or shutdown.

       -usbfdd
              USB FDD emulation mode: is almost the same of the previous one for
              a floppy. It enables the use of an  USB  floppy  as  it  would  be
              attached to an internal FD controller (for booting etc.)

       -lan   Enables/disables internal LAN controller.

       -soundlogo
              enable/disable startup sound logo.

       -startlogo
              startup logo mode (picture or animation&gt;.

       -trmode
              enable/disable the display&apos;s transreflective mode.

              Features  may also be set by specifying the (zero-offset) index of
              the option. e.g. toshset -cpu 0 sets the cpu speed to slow.


BUGS
       Many features are locked and can not be changed  when  the  battery  save
       mode  is  not  ``user.&apos;&apos;  Since I only have one laptop, I can&apos;t test this
       utility on other hardware. User feedback in this regard is helpful.  Some
       features  do not work on my laptop and they may work on your&apos;s, and visa-
       versa.

       Toshset requires an experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel  mod&#8208;
       ule with an ACPI-enabled kernel.
