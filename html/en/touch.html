TOUCH(1)                          User Commands                         TOUCH(1)



NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and  modification  times of each FILE to the current
       time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h  is
       supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string  of  - is handled specially and causes touch to
       change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced  file  (useful
              only on systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file&apos;s times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change  the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equiva&#8208;
              lent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such
       as  &quot;Sun,  29  Feb  2004 16:21:42 -0800&quot; or &quot;2004-02-29 16:21:42&quot; or even
       &quot;next Thursday&quot;.  A date string may  contain  items  indicating  calendar
       date,  time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of  the  day.   The
       date  string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is
       fully described in the info documentation.
