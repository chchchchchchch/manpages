TOWLOWER(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                TOWLOWER(3)



NAME
       towlower - convert a wide character to lowercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       wint_t towlower(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The   towlower()   function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of  the
       tolower(3) function.  If wc is a wide character, it is converted to  low&#8208;
       ercase.  Characters which do not have case are returned unchanged.  If wc
       is WEOF, WEOF is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The towlower() function returns the lowercase equivalent of wc,  or  WEOF
       if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of towlower() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for dealing  with  Unicode  charac&#8208;
       ters,  because  Unicode  knows  about three cases: upper, lower and title
       case.
