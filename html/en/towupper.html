TOWUPPER(3)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                TOWUPPER(3)



NAME
       towupper - convert a wide character to uppercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;

       wint_t towupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  towupper()  function  is  the wide-character equivalent of the toup&#8208;
       per(3) function.  If wc is a wide character, it is  converted  to  upper&#8208;
       case.   Characters  which do not have case are returned unchanged.  If wc
       is WEOF, WEOF is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The towupper() function returns the uppercase equivalent of wc,  or  WEOF
       if wc is WEOF.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of towupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for dealing  with  Unicode  charac&#8208;
       ters,  because  Unicode  knows  about three cases: upper, lower and title
       case.
