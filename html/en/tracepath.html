TRACEPATH(8)            System Manager&apos;s Manual: iputils            TRACEPATH(8)



NAME
       tracepath,  tracepath6  -  traces  path to a network host discovering MTU
       along this path

SYNOPSIS
       tracepath [-n] [-b] [-l pktlen] destination [port]


DESCRIPTION
       It traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path.   It  uses
       UDP  port  port  or  some random port.  It is similar to traceroute, only
       does not require superuser privileges and has no fancy options.

       tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6  and  classic  example  of
       application  of  Linux  error  queues.  The situation with IPv4 is worse,
       because commercial IP routers do not return enough  information  in  icmp
       error  messages.   Probably,  it  will change, when they will be updated.
       For now it uses Van Jacobson&apos;s trick, sweeping a range of  UDP  ports  to
       maintain trace history.

OPTIONS
       -n     Print primarily IP addresses numerically.

       -b     Print both of host names and IP addresses.

       -l     Sets the initial packet length to pktlen instead of 65536 for tra&#8208;
              cepath or 128000 for tracepath6.

OUTPUT
       root@mops:~ # tracepath6 3ffe:2400:0:109::2
        1?: [LOCALHOST]                              pmtu 1500
        1:  dust.inr.ac.ru                   0.411ms
        2:  dust.inr.ac.ru        asymm  1   0.390ms pmtu 1480
        2:  3ffe:2400:0:109::2               463.514ms reached
            Resume: pmtu 1480 hops 2 back 2

       The first column shows TTL of the  probe,  followed  by  colon.   Usually
       value  of  TTL  is  obtained from reply from network, but sometimes reply
       does not contain necessary information and we have to guess it.  In  this
       case the number is followed by ?.

       The  second column shows the network hop, which replied to the probe.  It
       is either address of router or word [LOCALHOST], if  the  probe  was  not
       sent to the network.

       The  rest  of line shows miscellaneous information about path to the cor&#8208;
       respinding hetwork hop. As rule it contains value of RTT.   Additionally,
       it  can show Path MTU, when it changes.  If the path is asymmetric or the
       probe finishes before it reach prescribed hop, difference between  number
       of  hops  in  forward  and  backward direction is shown following keyword
       async. This information is not reliable.  F.e. the third line shows asym&#8208;
       metry  of  1, it is because the first probe with TTL of 2 was rejected at
       the first hop due to Path MTU Discovery.

       The last line summarizes information about all the path to  the  destina&#8208;
       tion,  it  shows detected Path MTU, amount of hops to the destination and
       our guess about amount of hops from the destination to us, which  can  be
       different when the path is asymmetric.

&#12;AUTHOR
       tracepath was written by Alexey Kuznetsov &lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;.

SECURITY
       No security issues.

       This  lapidary  deserves to be elaborated.  tracepath is not a privileged
       program, unlike traceroute, ping and other beasts  of  this  kind.   tra&#8208;
       cepath may be executed by everyone who has some access to network, enough
       to send UDP datagrams to investigated destination using given port.

AVAILABILITY
       tracepath is part of iputils package and the latest versions are   avail&#8208;
       able   in   source   form  at  http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-cur&#8208;
       rent.tar.bz2.
