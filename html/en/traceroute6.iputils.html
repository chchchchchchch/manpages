NAME
       traceroute6 - traces path to a network host

SYNOPSIS
       traceroute6   [-dnrvV]   [-i   interface]  [-m  max_ttl]  [-p  port]  [-q
       max_probes] [-s source] [-w wait time] destination [size]


DESCRIPTION
       Description can be found in  traceroute(8),  all  the  references  to  IP
       replaced to IPv6. It is needless to copy the description from there.

SEE ALSO
       traceroute(8), tracepath(8), ping(8).

HISTORY
       This  program  has long history. Author of traceroute is Van Jacobson and
       it first appeared in 1988. This clone is based on a port of traceroute to
       IPv6  published  in NRL IPv6 distribution in 1996. In turn, it was ported
       to Linux by Pedro Roque. After  this  it  was  kept  in  sync  by  Alexey
       Kuznetsov &lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;. And eventually entered iputils package.

SECURITY
       tracepath6  requires  CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be executed. It is safe
       to be used as set-uid root.

AVAILABILITY
       traceroute6 is part of  iputils  package  and  the  latest  versions  are
       available  in  source  form at http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-cur&#8208;
       rent.tar.bz2.
