NAME
       transfig - creates a makefile for portable LaTeX figures

SYNOPSIS
       transfig  [ -L language ] [ -M makefile ] [ -T texfile ] [ -I macrofile ]
       [ -V ] [ control_specs figfile ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Transfig creates a makefile to translate figures described in Fig code or
       PIC  into  a specified LaTeX graphics language.  PIC files are identified
       by the suffix &quot;.pic&quot;; Fig files can be specified either with  or  without
       the  suffix  &quot;.fig&quot; .  Transfig also creates a TeX macro file appropriate
       to the target language.

OPTIONS
       The language specifier must be one of box,  cgm,  eepic,  eepicemu,  emf,
       epic,  eps, ge, gif, ibmgl, jpeg, latex, map, mf, mmp, mp, pcx, pdf, pdf&#8208;
       tex, pdftex_t, pic, pictex, png, ppm, ps,  psfig,  pstex,  pstex_t,  ptk,
       sld,  textyl,  tiff,  tk, tpic, xbm, xpm or null.  The specifier psfig is
       like the ps specifier, except that it make use of the psfig  macro  pack&#8208;
       age.   The  specifier  pstex  is like psfig, except that it uses LaTeX to
       process formatted (special) text.  The specifier null results in the fig&#8208;
       ures  being  replaced by empty boxes of the appropriate size.  If no lan&#8208;
       guage is specified, epic is the default.

       The names of the makefile and TeX macro file can be set with the  -M  and
       -T options.  The default names are &quot;Makefile&quot; and &quot;transfig.tex&quot;, respec&#8208;
       tively.  If there is already  an  existing  makefile  in  the  directory,
       transfig  first renames it to makefile~.  The same holds for any existing
       TeX macro file.  If the -I option is specified, then a command to read in
       macrofile  is      inserted into the TeX macro file.  If the -V option is
       specified, the program version number is printed only.

       Control specifiers are

       -m mag set the magnification at which the  figure  is  rendered  (default
              1.0).

       -f font
              set the default font family used for text objects (default &quot;rm&quot;).

       -s fontsize
              set  the  default  font size (in points) for text objects (default
              11*mag).

       -o option
              pass the specified option string through to fig2dev.

       If there is no scaling, the default font is an eleven point  roman  font.
       Language and control specifiers may occur more than once; they affect the
       translation of files which appear to their right in  the  argument  list.
       If no files are specified, then &quot;*.fig&quot; is assumed.
