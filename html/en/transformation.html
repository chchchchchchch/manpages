Detailed Description

Function Documentation
   __extern int caca_invert (caca_canvas_t *cv) Invert a canvas&apos; colours (black
       becomes white, red becomes cyan, etc.) without changing the characters in
       it.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to invert.

       Returns:
           This function always returns 0.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect().

   __extern int caca_flip (caca_canvas_t *cv) Flip a canvas horizontally,
       choosing characters that look like the mirrored version wherever
       possible. Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, but the
       operation is guaranteed to be involutive: performing it again gives back
       the original canvas.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to flip.

       Returns:
           This function always returns 0.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect(), and CACA_MAGIC_FULLWIDTH.

   __extern int caca_flop (caca_canvas_t *cv) Flip a canvas vertically, choosing
       characters that look like the mirrored version wherever possible. Some
       characters will stay unchanged by the process, but the operation is
       guaranteed to be involutive: performing it again gives back the original
       canvas.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to flop.

       Returns:
           This function always returns 0.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect().

   __extern int caca_rotate_180 (caca_canvas_t *cv) Apply a 180-degree
       transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the
       upside-down version wherever possible. Some characters will stay
       unchanged by the process, but the operation is guaranteed to be
       involutive: performing it again gives back the original canvas.
       This function never fails.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to rotate.

       Returns:
           This function always returns 0.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect(), and CACA_MAGIC_FULLWIDTH.

   __extern int caca_rotate_left (caca_canvas_t *cv) Apply a 90-degree
       transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the
       rotated version wherever possible. Characters cells are rotated two-by-
       two. Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, some others will
       be replaced by close equivalents. Fullwidth characters at odd horizontal
       coordinates will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be
       reversible at all.
       Note that the width of the canvas is divided by two and becomes the new
       height. Height is multiplied by two and becomes the new width. If the
       original width is an odd number, the division is rounded up.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this
         happens, the previous canvas handle is still valid.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to rotate left.

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

   __extern int caca_rotate_right (caca_canvas_t *cv) Apply a 90-degree
       transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the
       rotated version wherever possible. Characters cells are rotated two-by-
       two. Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, some others will
       be replaced by close equivalents. Fullwidth characters at odd horizontal
       coordinates will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be
       reversible at all.
       Note that the width of the canvas is divided by two and becomes the new
       height. Height is multiplied by two and becomes the new width. If the
       original width is an odd number, the division is rounded up.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this
         happens, the previous canvas handle is still valid.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to rotate right.

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect().

   __extern int caca_stretch_left (caca_canvas_t *cv) Apply a 90-degree
       transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the
       rotated version wherever possible. Some characters will stay unchanged by
       the process, some others will be replaced by close equivalents. Fullwidth
       characters will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible
       at all.
       Note that the width and height of the canvas are swapped, causing its
       aspect ratio to look stretched.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this
         happens, the previous canvas handle is still valid.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to rotate left.

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

       References caca_add_dirty_rect().

   __extern int caca_stretch_right (caca_canvas_t *cv) Apply a 270-degree
       transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the
       rotated version wherever possible. Some characters will stay unchanged by
       the process, some others will be replaced by close equivalents. Fullwidth
       characters will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible
       at all.
       Note that the width and height of the canvas are swapped, causing its
       aspect ratio to look stretched.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this
         happens, the previous canvas handle is still valid.

       Parameters:
           cv The canvas to rotate right.

       Returns:
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.
