TRANSSETDF(1)                                                      TRANSSETDF(1)



NAME
       transsetdf - change window transparencies on the fly

SYNOPSIS
       transsetdf [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the transsetdf command.

       transsetdf is a program that allows the user to change window transparen&#8208;
       cies on the fly.  Supported methods include using window manager hotkeys,
       &apos;select  by  pointing&apos; without actually selecting a window, and selecting
       by name and window id.  transset-df  is  a  modified  version  of  xorg&apos;s
       transset  and  requires  compositing to function.  It is meant to allow a
       windowmanger-independent way to support transparency.
