NAME
       tred - transitive reduction filter for directed graphs

SYNOPSIS
       tred [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       tred computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs, and prints the
       resulting graphs to standard output.  This removes edges implied by tran&#8208;
       sitivity.   Nodes  and subgraphs are not otherwise affected.  The ``mean&#8208;
       ing&apos;&apos; and validity of the reduced graphs is application dependent.   tred
       is  particularly  useful  as  a  preprocessor to dot to reduce clutter in
       dense layouts.

       Undirected graphs are silently ignored.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If  no
               files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

BUGS
       Using bitmaps internally would substantially decrease running time.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If  a graph has cycles, its transitive reduction is not uniquely defined.
       In this case tred emits a warning.
