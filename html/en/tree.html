DESCRIPTION
       The  tree  command  creates  tree data objects.  A tree object is general
       ordered tree of nodes.  Each node has both a label and a  key-value  list
       of  data.   Data can be heterogeneous, since nodes do not have to contain
       the same data keys.  It is associated with a Tcl command that you can use
       to access and modify the its structure and data. Tree objects can also be
       managed via a C API.

INTRODUCTION
EXAMPLE
SYNTAX
       tree create ?treeName?
              Creates a new tree object.  The name of the new tree is  returned.
              If  no  treeName argument is present, then the name of the tree is
              automatically generated in the form &quot;tree0&quot;, &quot;tree1&quot;, etc.  If the
              substring  &quot;#auto&quot;  is found in treeName, it is automatically sub&#8208;
              stituted  by  a   generated   name.    For   example,   the   name
              .foo.#auto.bar will be translated to .foo.tree0.bar.

              A  new Tcl command (by the same name as the tree) is also created.
              Another Tcl command or  tree  object  can  not  already  exist  as
              treeName.   If  the  Tcl command is deleted, the tree will also be
              freed.  The new tree will contain just the root node.   Trees  are
              by  default,  created  in  the  current  namespace, not the global
              namespace, unless treeName contains a namespace qualifier, such as
              &quot;fred::myTree&quot;.

       tree destroy treeName...
              Releases  one  of  more  trees.   The  Tcl command associated with
              treeName is also  removed.   Trees  are  reference  counted.   The
              internal  tree  data  object  isn&apos;t destroyed until no one else is
              using the tree.

       tree names ?pattern?
              Returns the names of all tree objects.  if a pattern  argument  is
              given,  then  the only those trees whose name matches pattern will
              be listed.

NODE IDS AND TAGS
       Nodes in a tree object may be referred in either of two ways: by id or by
       tag.  Each node has a unique serial number or id that is assigned to that
       node when it&apos;s created. The id of an node never changes  and  id  numbers
       are not re-used.

       A  node  may  also  have any number of tags associated with it.  A tag is
       just a string of characters, and it may take any form except that  of  an
       integer.   For  example,  &quot;x123&quot; is valid, but &quot;123&quot; isn&apos;t.  The same tag
       may be associated with many different nodes.  This is  commonly  done  to
       group nodes in various interesting ways.

       There  are  two  built-in tags: The tag all is implicitly associated with
       every node in the tree.  It may be used to invoke operations on  all  the
       nodes  in  the  tree.   The tag root is managed automatically by the tree
       object. It applies to the node currently set as root.

       When specifying nodes in tree object commands, if  the  specifier  is  an
       integer  then it is assumed to refer to the single node with that id.  If
       the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer  to  all  of
       the nodes in the tree that have a tag matching the specifier.  The symbol
       node is used below to indicate that an argument specifies  either  an  id
       that  selects  a  single  node  or a tag that selects zero or more nodes.
       Many tree commands only operate on a single node at a time;  if  node  is
       specified  in  a  way that names multiple items, then an error &quot;refers to
       more than one node&quot; is generated.

NODE MODIFIERS
       You can also specify node in relation to another node by appending one or
       more  modifiers  to  the  node id or tag.  A modifier refers to a node in
       relation to the specified node.  For example, &quot;root-&gt;firstchild&quot;  selects
       the first subtree of the root node.

       The following modifiers are available:

              firstchild
                        Selects the first child of the node.

              lastchild Selects the last child of the node.

              next      Selects the next node in preorder to the node.

              nextsibling
                        Selects the next sibling of the node.

              parent    Selects the parent of the node.

              previous  Selects the previous node in preorder to the node.

              prevsibling
                        Selects the previous sibling of the node.

              &quot;label&quot;   Selects  the node whose label is label.  Enclosing label
                        in quotes indicates to always search for a node  by  its
                        label  (for  example,  even if the node is labeled &quot;par&#8208;
                        ent&quot;).

       It&apos;s an error the node  can&apos;t  be  found.   For  example,  lastchild  and
       firstchild  will generate errors if the node has no children.  The excep&#8208;
       tion to this is the index operation.  You can use index to test if a mod&#8208;
       ifier is valid.

TREE OPERATIONS
       Once  you  create  a tree object, you can use its Tcl command to query or
       modify it.  The general form is treeName operation ?arg?...  Both  opera&#8208;
       tion  and its arguments determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       operations available for trees are listed below.

       treeName ancestor node1 node2
              Returns the mutual ancestor of the two nodes node1 and node2.  The
              ancestor  can  be one of the two nodes.  For example, if node1 and
              node2 are the same nodes, their ancestor is node1.

       treeName apply node ?switches?
              Runs commands  for  all  nodes  matching  the  criteria  given  by
              switches for the subtree designated by node.  By default all nodes
              match, but you can set switches to narrow the match.  This  opera&#8208;
              tion differs from find in two ways: 1) Tcl commands can be invoked
              both pre- and post-traversal of a node and 2) the tree  is  always
              traversed in depth first order.

              The -exact, -glob, and -regexp switches indicate both what kind of
              pattern matching to perform and the pattern.  By default each pat&#8208;
              tern  will be compared with the node label.  You can set more than
              one of these switches.  If any of the patterns match (logical or),
              the  node  matches.  If the -key switch is used, it designates the
              data field to be matched.

              The valid switches are listed below:

              -depth number
                        Descend at most number (a non-negative  integer)  levels
                        If  number  is  1 this means only apply the tests to the
                        children of node.

              -exact string
                        Matches each node using string.   The  node  must  match
                        string exactly.

              -glob string
                        Test  each node to string using global pattern matching.
                        Matching is done in a fashion similar to  that  used  by
                        the C-shell.

              -invert   Select  non-matching nodes.  Any node that doesn&apos;t match
                        the given criteria will be selected.

              -key key  If pattern  matching  is  selected  (using  the  -exact,
                        -glob,  or  -regexp switches), compare the values of the
                        data field keyed by key instead of the node&apos;s label.  If
                        no pattern matching switches are set, then any node with
                        this data key will match.

              -leafonly Only test nodes with no children.

              -nocase   Ignore case when matching patterns.

              -path     Use the node&apos;s full  path  when  comparing  nodes.   The
                        node&apos;s  full path is a list of labels, starting from the
                        root of each ancestor and the node itself.

              -precommand command
                        Invoke command for each matching node.   Before  command
                        is  invoked,  the  id  of the node is appended.  You can
                        control processing by the return value of  command.   If
                        command  generates  an  error,  processing stops and the
                        find operation returns an error.  But if command returns
                        break, then processing stops, no error is generated.  If
                        command returns continue, then processing stops on  that
                        subtree and continues on the next.

              -postcommand command
                        Invoke  command  for each matching node.  Before command
                        is invoked, the id of the node  is  appended.   You  can
                        control  processing  by the return value of command.  If
                        command generates an error,  processing  stops  and  the
                        find operation returns an error.  But if command returns
                        break, then processing stops, no error is generated.  If
                        command  returns continue, then processing stops on that
                        subtree and continues on the next.

              -regexp string
                        Test each node using string as a regular expression pat&#8208;
                        tern.

              -tag string
                        Only test nodes that have the tag string.

       treeName attach treeObject
              Attaches to an existing tree object treeObject.  This is for cases
              where the tree object was previously created via the C  API.   The
              current  tree associated with treeName is discarded.  In addition,
              the current set of tags, notifier events, and traces are removed.

       treeName children node
              Returns a list of children for node.  If node is a leaf,  then  an
              empty string is returned.

       treeName copy srcNode ?destTree? parentNode ?switches?
              Copies  srcNode into parentNode. Both nodes srcNode and parentNode
              must already exist. The id of the new node is  returned.  You  can
              copy from one tree to another.  If a destTree argument is present,
              it indicates the name of the destination tree.   By  default  both
              the  source and destination trees are the same. The valid switches
              are listed below:

              -label string
                     Label destNode as string.  By  default,  destNode  has  the
                     same label as srcNode.

              -overwrite
                     Overwrite  nodes  that  already  exist.  Normally nodes are
                     always created, even if there already exists a node by  the
                     same  name.   This switch indicates to add or overwrite the
                     node&apos;s data fields.

              -recurse
                     Recursively copy all the subtrees of srcNode as  well.   In
                     this  case,  srcNode can&apos;t be an ancestor of destNode as it
                     would result in a cyclic copy.

              -tags  Copy tag  information.   Normally  the  following  node  is
                     copied:  its label and data fields.  This indicates to copy
                     tags as well.

       treeName degree node
              Returns the number of children of node.

       treeName delete node...
              Recursively deletes one or more nodes from the tree.  The node and
              all  its  descendants are removed.   The one exception is the root
              node.  In this case, only its descendants are removed.   The  root
              node will remain.  Any tags or traces on the nodes are released.

       treeName depth node
              Returns  the  depth of the node.  The depth is the number of steps
              from the node to the root of the tree.  The depth of the root node
              is 0.

       treeName dump node
              Returns  a  list of the paths and respective data for node and its
              descendants.  The subtree designated by node is traversed  return&#8208;
              ing  the  following  information for each node: 1) the node&apos;s path
              relative to node, 2) a sublist key value  pairs  representing  the
              node&apos;s  data fields, and 3) a sublist of tags.  This list returned
              can be used later to copy or restore the  tree  with  the  restore
              operation.

       treeName dumpfile node fileName
              Writes  a  list  of the paths and respective data for node and its
              descendants to the given file fileName.  The subtree designated by
              node  is  traversed  returning  the following information for each
              node: 1) the node&apos;s path relative to node, 2) a sublist key  value
              pairs  representing  the  node&apos;s  data fields, and 3) a sublist of
              tags.  This list returned can be used later to copy or restore the
              tree with the restore operation.

       treeName exists node ?key?
              Indicates  if  node  exists  in  the  tree.   If a key argument is
              present then the command also indicates if the  named  data  field
              exists.

       treeName find node ?switches?
              Finds  for  all  nodes matching the criteria given by switches for
              the subtree designated by node.  A list of the selected  nodes  is
              returned.  By default all nodes match, but you can set switches to
              narrow the match.

              The -exact, -glob, and -regexp switches indicate both what kind of
              pattern matching to perform and the pattern.  By default each pat&#8208;
              tern will be compared with the node label.  You can set more  than
              one of these switches.  If any of the patterns match (logical or),
              the node matches.  If the -key switch is used, it  designates  the
              data field to be matched.

              The  order  in  which the nodes are traversed is controlled by the
              -order switch.  The possible orderings  are  preorder,  postorder,
              inorder, and breadthfirst.  The default is postorder.

              The valid switches are listed below:

              -addtag string
                        Add the tag string to each selected node.

              -count number
                        Stop   processing  after  number  (a  positive  integer)
                        matches.

              -depth number
                        Descend at most number (a non-negative  integer)  levels
                        If  number  is  1 this means only apply the tests to the
                        children of node.

              -exact string
                        Matches each node using string.   The  node  must  match
                        string exactly.

              -exec command
                        Invoke  command  for each matching node.  Before command
                        is invoked, the id of the node  is  appended.   You  can
                        control  processing  by the return value of command.  If
                        command generates an error,  processing  stops  and  the
                        find operation returns an error.  But if command returns
                        break, then processing stops, no error is generated.  If
                        command  returns continue, then processing stops on that
                        subtree and continues on the next.

              -glob string
                        Test each node to string using global pattern  matching.
                        Matching  is  done  in a fashion similar to that used by
                        the C-shell.

              -invert   Select non-matching nodes.  Any node that doesn&apos;t  match
                        the given criteria will be selected.

              -key key  Compare  the  values  of  the  data  field  keyed by key
                        instead of the node&apos;s label.  If  no  pattern  is  given
                        (-exact, -glob, or -regexp switches), then any node with
                        this data key will match.

              -leafonly Only test nodes with no children.

              -nocase   Ignore case when matching patterns.

              -order string
                        Traverse the tree and process nodes according to string.
                        String can be one of the following:

                        breadthfirst
                                  Process the node and the subtrees at each suc&#8208;
                                  cessive level. Each node on a  level  is  pro&#8208;
                                  cessed before going to the next level.

                        inorder   Recursively  process  the  nodes  of the first
                                  subtree, the node itself, and any the  remain&#8208;
                                  ing subtrees.

                        postorder Recursively  process  all  subtrees before the
                                  node.

                        preorder  Recursively process the node first,  then  any
                                  subtrees.

              -path     Use the node&apos;s full path when comparing nodes.

              -regexp string
                        Test each node using string as a regular expression pat&#8208;
                        tern.

              -tag string
                        Only test nodes that have the tag string.

       treeName findchild node label
              Searches for a child node Ilabel in node.  The  id  of  the  child
              node is returned if found.  Otherwise -1 is returned.

       treeName firstchild node
              Returns  the id of the first child in the node&apos;s list of subtrees.
              If node is a leaf (has no children), then -1 is returned.

       treeName get node ?key? ?defaultValue?
              Returns a list of key-value pairs of data for the node.  If key is
              present,  then  onlyx  the value for that particular data field is
              returned.  It&apos;s normally an error if node  does  not  contain  the
              data  field key.  But if you provide a defaultValue argument, this
              value is returned instead (node will still not contain key).  This
              feature  can  be used to access a data field of node without first
              testing if it  exists.   This  operation  may  trigger  read  data
              traces.

       treeName index node
              Returns the id of node.  If node is a tag, it can only specify one
              node.  If node does not represent a valid node id or tag,  or  has
              modifiers that are invalid, then -1 is returned.

       treeName insert parent ?switches?
              Inserts  a  new  node  into parent node parent.  The id of the new
              node is returned. The following switches are available:

              -after child
                        Position node after child.  The node  child  must  be  a
                        child of parent.

              -at number
                        Inserts the node into parent&apos;s list of children at posi&#8208;
                        tion number.  The default is to append node.

              -before child
                        Position node before child.  The node child  must  be  a
                        child of parent.

              -data dataList
                        Sets  the  value for each data field in dataList for the
                        new node. DataList is a list of key-value pairs.

              -label string
                        Designates  the  labels  of  the  node  as  string.   By
                        default, nodes are labeled as node0, node1, etc.

              -node id  Designates  the  id  for the node.  Normally new ids are
                        automatically generated.  This allows you  to  create  a
                        node  with  a  specific id.  It is an error if the id is
                        already used by another node in the tree.

              -tags tagList
                        Adds each tag in tagList to the new node. TagList  is  a
                        list of tags, so be careful if a tag has embedded space.

       treeName is property args
              Indicates the property of a node. Both property and args determine
              the property being tested.  Returns 1 if  true  and  0  otherwise.
              The following property and args are valid:

              ancestor node1 node2
                        Indicates if node1 is an ancestor of node2.

              before node1 node2
                        Indicates  if  node1 is before node2 in depth first tra&#8208;
                        versal.

              leaf node Indicates if node is a leaf (it has no subtrees).

              root node Indicates if node is the designated root.  This  can  be
                        changed by the root operation.

       treeName label node ?newLabel?
              Returns  the label of the node designated by node.  If newLabel is
              present, the node is relabeled using it as the new label.

       treeName lastchild node
              Returns the id of the last child in the node&apos;s list  of  subtrees.
              If node is a leaf (has no children), then -1 is returned.

       treeName move node newParent ?switches?
              Moves  node  into newParent. Node is appended to the list children
              of newParent.  Node can not be  an  ancestor  of  newParent.   The
              valid flags for switches are described below.

              -after child
                        Position  node  after  child.   The node child must be a
                        child of newParent.

              -at number
                        Inserts node into parent&apos;s list of children at  position
                        number. The default is to append the node.

              -before child
                        Position  node  before  child.  The node child must be a
                        child of newParent.

       treeName next node
              Returns the next node from node in a preorder traversal.  If  node
              is the last node in the tree, then -1 is returned.
&#12;       treeName nextsibling node
              Returns  the  node  representing the next subtree from node in its
              parent&apos;s list of children.  If node is the last child, then -1  is
              returned.

       treeName notify args
              Manages  notification events that indicate that the tree structure
              has been changed.  See the NOTIFY OPERATIONS section below.

       treeName parent node
              Returns the parent node of node.  If node is the root of the tree,
              then -1 is returned.

       treeName path node
              Returns the full path (from root) of node.

       treeName position node
              Returns the position of the node in its parent&apos;s list of children.
              Positions are numbered from 0.  The position of the root  node  is
              always 0.

       treeName previous node
              Returns  the  previous node from node in a preorder traversal.  If
              node is the root of the tree, then -1 is returned.

       treeName prevsibling node
              Returns the node representing the previous subtree  from  node  in
              its  parent&apos;s  list of children.  If node is the first child, then
              -1 is returned.

       treeName restore node dataString switches
              Performs the inverse function of  the  dump  operation,  restoring
              nodes  to  the  tree.  The format of dataString is exactly what is
              returned by the dump operation.  It&apos;s a list  containing  informa&#8208;
              tion for each node to be restored.  The information consists of 1)
              the relative path of the node, 2) a sublist  of  key  value  pairs
              representing  the node&apos;s data, and 3) a list of tags for the node.
              Nodes are created starting from node. Nodes can be listed  in  any
              order.   If  a  node&apos;s  path  describes ancestor nodes that do not
              already exist, they are automatically created.  The valid switches
              are listed below:

              -overwrite
                     Overwrite  nodes  that  already  exist.  Normally nodes are
                     always created, even if there already exists a node by  the
                     same  name.   This switch indicates to add or overwrite the
                     node&apos;s data fields.

       treeName restorefile node fileName switches
              Performs the inverse function of the dumpfile operation, restoring
              nodes  to  the tree from the file fileName. The format of fileName
              is exactly what is returned by the  dumpfile  operation.   It&apos;s  a
              list  containing  information  for  each node to be restored.  The
              information consists of 1) the relative path of  the  node,  2)  a
              sublist  of key value pairs representing the node&apos;s data, and 3) a
              list of tags for the node.  Nodes are created starting from  node.
              Nodes  can  be  listed  in  any order.  If a node&apos;s path describes
              ancestor nodes that do not already exist, they  are  automatically
              created.  The valid switches are listed below:

              -overwrite
                     Overwrite  nodes  that  already  exist.  Normally nodes are
                     always created, even if there already exists a node by  the
                     same  name.   This switch indicates to add or overwrite the
                     node&apos;s data fields.

       treeName root ?node?
              Returns the id of the root node.  Normally this is node 0.   If  a
              node  argument  is  provided,  it  will become the new root of the
              tree. This lets you temporarily work within a subset of the  tree.
              Changing  root  affects  operations  such as next, path, previous,
              etc.

       treeName set node key value ?key value...?
              Sets one or more data fields in node. Node may be a tag that  rep&#8208;
              resents  several  nodes.   Key is the name of the data field to be
              set and value is its respective value.  This operation may trigger
              write and create data traces.

       treeName size node
              Returns the number of nodes in the subtree. This includes the node
              and all its descendants.  The size of a leaf node is 1.

       treeName sort node ?switches?

              -ascii    Compare strings using the ASCII  collation order.

              -command string
                        Use command string as a comparison command.  To  compare
                        two  elements,  evaluate a Tcl script consisting of com&#8208;
                        mand with the two elements appended as additional  argu&#8208;
                        ments.   The  script should return an integer less than,
                        equal to, or greater than zero if the first  element  is
                        to  be  considered  less than, equal to, or greater than
                        the second, respectively.

              -decreasing
                        Sort in decreasing order (largest items come first).

              -dictionary
                        Compare strings  using  a  dictionary-style  comparison.
                        This  is  the  same as -ascii except (a) case is ignored
                        except as a tie-breaker and (b) if two  strings  contain
                        embedded  numbers,  the numbers compare as integers, not
                        characters.  For example, in  -dictionary  mode,  bigBoy
                        sorts between bigbang and bigboy, and x10y sorts between
                        x9y and x11y.

              -integer  Compare the nodes as integers.

              -key string
                        Sort based upon the node&apos;s data field keyed  by  string.
                        Normally nodes are sorted according to their label.

              -path     Compare  the  full path of each node.  The default is to
                        compare only its label.

              -real     Compare the nodes as real numbers.

              -recurse  Recursively sort the entire subtree rooted at node.

              -reorder  Recursively  sort  subtrees  for  each  node.   Warning.
                        Unlike  the  normal  flat sort, where a list of nodes is
                        returned, this will reorder the tree.

       treeName tag args
              Manages tags for the tree object.  See the TAG OPERATIONS  section
              below.

       treeName trace args
              Manages  traces  for data fields in the tree object.  Traces cause
              Tcl commands to be executed whenever a data field  of  a  node  is
              created,  read,  written,  or unset.  Traces can be set for a spe&#8208;
              cific node or a tag, representing possibly many  nodes.   See  the
              TRACE OPERATIONS section below.

       treeName unset node key...
              Removes  one or more data fields from node. Node may be a tag that
              represents several nodes.  Key is the name of the data field to be
              removed.   It&apos;s  not  an error is node does not contain key.  This
              operation may trigger unset data traces.

TAG OPERATIONS
       Tags are a general means of selecting and marking nodes in the  tree.   A
       tag  is just a string of characters, and it may take any form except that
       of an integer.  The same tag may be associated with many different nodes.

       There are two built-in tags: The tag all is  implicitly  associated  with
       every  node  in the tree.  It may be used to invoke operations on all the
       nodes in the tree.  The tag root is managed  automatically  by  the  tree
       object.   It  specifies the node that is currently set as the root of the
       tree.

       Most tree operations use tags.  And several operations let you operate on
       multiple  nodes at once.  For example, you can use the set operation with
       the tag all to set a data field in for all nodes in the tree.

       Tags are invoked by the tag operation.  The general form is treeName  tag
       operation  ?arg?...  Both operation and its arguments determine the exact
       behavior of the command.  The operations available for  tags  are  listed
       below.

       treeName tag add string node...
              Adds the tag string to one of more nodes.

       treeName tag delete string node...
              Deletes the tag string from one or more nodes.

       treeName tag forget string
              Removes  the  tag  string from all nodes.  It&apos;s not an error if no
              nodes are tagged as string.

       treeName tag names ?node?
              Returns a list of tags used by the tree.  If a  node  argument  is
              present, only those tags used by node are returned.

       treeName tag nodes string
              Returns  a  list of nodes that have the tag string.  If no node is
              tagged as string, then an empty string is returned.

TRACE OPERATIONS
       Data fields can be traced much in the same way that  you  can  trace  Tcl
       variables.  Data traces cause Tcl commands to be executed whenever a par&#8208;
       ticular data field of a node is created,  read,  written,  or  unset.   A
       trace  can  apply to one or more nodes.  You can trace a specific node by
       using its id, or a group of nodes by a their tag.

       The tree&apos;s get, set, and unset operations  can  trigger  various  traces.
       The  get  operation  can  cause a read  trace to fire.  The set operation
       causes a write trace to fire.  And if the data field is written  for  the
       first  time, you will also get a create trace.  The unset operation trig&#8208;
       gers unset traces.

       Data traces are invoked by the trace  operation.   The  general  form  is
       treeName  trace  operation  ?arg?...   Both  operation  and its arguments
       determine the exact behavior of the command.   The  operations  available
       for traces are listed below.

       treeName trace create node key ops command
              Creates  a  trace  for  node on data field key.  Node can refer to
              more than one node (for example, the tag all). If node is  a  tag,
              any node with that tag can possibly trigger a trace, invoking com&#8208;
              mand.  Command is command  prefix,  typically  a  procedure  name.
              Whenever a trace is triggered, four arguments are appended to com&#8208;
              mand before it is invoked: treeName, id of the node, key and, ops.
              Note that no nodes need have the field key.  A trace identifier in
              the form &quot;trace0&quot;, &quot;trace1&quot;, etc.  is returned.

              Ops indicates which operations are of interest,  and  consists  of
              one or more of the following letters:

              r      Invoke  command  whenever  key is read. Both read and write
                     traces are temporarily disabled when command is executed.

              w      Invoke command whenever key  is  written.   Both  read  and
                     write  traces are temporarily disabled when command is exe&#8208;
                     cuted.

              c      Invoke command whenever key is created.

              u      Invoke command whenever key is unset.  Data fields are typ&#8208;
                     ically unset with the unset command.   Data fields are also
                     unset when the tree is released, but all  traces  are  dis&#8208;
                     abled prior to that.


       treeName trace delete traceId...
              Deletes  one  of  more  traces.   TraceId  is the trace identifier
              returned by the trace create operation.

       treeName trace info traceId
              Returns information about the trace traceId.  TraceId is  a  trace
              identifier  previously  returned  by  the  trace create operation.
              It&apos;s the same information specified for the  trace  create  opera&#8208;
              tion.  It consists of the node id or tag, data field key, a string
              of letters indicating the operations that are traced (it&apos;s in  the
              same form as ops) and, the command prefix.

       treeName trace names
              Returns a list of identifiers for all the current traces.

NOTIFY OPERATIONS
       Tree  objects  can be shared among many clients, such as a hiertable wid&#8208;
       get.  Any client can create or delete nodes, sorting the tree, etc.   You
       can  request  to  be notified whenever these events occur.  Notify events
       cause Tcl commands to be executed whenever the tree structure is changed.

       Notifications are handled by the notify operation.  The general  form  is
       treeName  notify  operation  ?arg?...   Both  operation and its arguments
       determine the exact behavior of the command.   The  operations  available
       for events are listed below.

       treeName notify create ?switches? command ?args?...
              Creates  a notifier for the tree.  A notify identifier in the form
              &quot;notify0&quot;, &quot;notify1&quot;, etc.  is returned.

              Command and args are saved and invoked whenever the tree structure
              is  changed (according to switches). Two arguments are appended to
              command and args before it&apos;s invoked: the id of  the  node  and  a
              string  representing  the type of event that occured.  One of more
              switches can be set to indicate the events that are  of  interest.
              The valid switches are as follows:

              -create   Invoke command whenever a new node has been added.

              -delete   Invoke command whenever a node has been deleted.

              -move     Invoke command whenever a node has been moved.

              -sort     Invoke  command  whenever  the  tree has been sorted and
                        reordered.

              -relabel  Invoke command whenever a node has been relabeled.

              -allevents
                        Invoke command whenever any of the above events occur.

              -whenidle When an event occurs don&apos;t invoke  command  immediately,
                        but  queue  it to be run the next time the event loop is
                        entered and there are no events to process.   If  subse&#8208;
                        quent  events  occur  before  the event loop is entered,
                        command will still be invoked only once.

       treeName notify delete notifyId
              Deletes one or more notifiers from  the  tree.   NotifyId  is  the
              notifier identifier returned by the notify create operation.

       treeName notify info notifyId
              Returns  information about the notify event notifyId.  NotifyId is
              a notify identifier previously returned by the notify create oper&#8208;
              ation.   It&apos;s the same information specified for the notify create
              operation.  It consists of the notify id, a sublist of event flags
              (it&apos;s in the same form as flags) and, the command prefix.

       treeName notify names
              Returns a list of identifiers for all the current notifiers.
