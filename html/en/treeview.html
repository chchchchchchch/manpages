NAME
       treeview - Create and manipulate hierarchical table widgets
_________________________________________________________________

SYNOPSIS
       treeview pathName ?options?

DESCRIPTION
       The  treeview  widget  displays  a  tree  of  data.  It replaces both the
       hiertable and hierbox widgets.  The treeview is  100%  syntax  compatible
       with the hiertable widget.  The hiertable command is retained for sake of
       script-level compatibility.  This widget obsoletes  the  hierbox  widget.
       It  does  everything  the  old hierbox widget did, but also provides data
       sharing (via tree data objects) and the ability to tag nodes.

INTRODUCTION
       The treeview widget displays hierarchical data.  Data is  represented  as
       nodes  in a general-ordered tree.  Each node may have sub-nodes and these
       nodes can in turn has their own children.

       A node is displayed as a row entry in the widget.  Each entry has a  text
       label  and  icon.   When  a  node has children, its entry is drawn with a
       small button to the left of the label.  Clicking the mouse over this but&#8208;
       ton  opens  or  closes  the  node.  When a node is open, its children are
       exposed.  When it is closed, the children and their descedants  are  hid&#8208;
       den.   The button is normally a + or - symbol (ala Windows Explorer), but
       can be replaced with a pair of Tk images (open and closed images).

       If the node has data associated with it, they can be displayed in columns
       running  vertically  on either side the tree.  You can control the color,
       font, etc of each entry.  Any entry label or data field can be edited in-
       place.

TREE DATA OBJECT
       The  tree  is not stored inside the widget but in a tree data object (see
       the tree command for a further explanation).  Tree data  objects  can  be
       shared  among  different  clients,  such as a treeview widget or the tree
       command.  You can walk the tree and manage its data with the tree command
       tree, while displaying it with the treeview widget.  Whenever the tree is
       updated, the treeview widget is automatically redrawn.

       By default, the treeview widget creates its own tree  object.   The  tree
       initially contains just a root node.  But you can also display trees cre&#8208;
       ated by the tree command using the -tree configuration option.   Treeview
       widgets  can  share  the  same tree object, possibly displaying different
       views of the same data.

       A tree object has both a Tcl and C API.  You can insert or  delete  nodes
       using  treeview  widget or tree command operations, but also from C code.
       For example, you can load the tree from your C code while still  managing
       and  displaying  the  tree from Tcl. The widget is automatically notified
       whenever the tree is modified via C or Tcl.

SYNTAX
       treeview pathName ?option value?...  The treeview command creates  a  new
       window  pathName  and  makes it into a treeview widget.  At the time this
       command is invoked, there must not exist a  window  named  pathName,  but
       pathName&apos;s parent must exist.  Additional options may be specified on the
       command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the widget
       such  as  its colors and font.  See the configure operation below for the
       exact details about what option and value pairs are valid.

       If successful, treeview returns the path name of  the  widget.   It  also
       creates  a new Tcl command by the same name.  You can use this command to
       invoke various operations that query or modify the widget.   The  general
       form  is:  pathName  operation ?arg?...  Both operation and its arguments
       determine the exact behavior of the command.   The  operations  available
       are described in the TREEVIEW OPERATIONS section.

IDS AND TAGS
       Nodes can be inserted into a tree using the treeview widget

              blt::treeview .t
              set node [.t insert end root &quot;one&quot;]

       or tree command.

              set tree [blt::tree create]
              set node [$tree insert root &quot;one&quot;]

       In  both  cases,  a number identifying the node is returned (the value of
       $node).  This serial number or id uniquely identifies the  node.   Please
       note  that  you can&apos;t infer a location or position of a node from its id.
       The only exception is that the root node is always id 0. Since nodes  may
       have  the  same labels or be moved within the tree, ids provide an conve&#8208;
       nient way to identify nodes.  If a tree is shared, the ids  will  be  the
       same  regardless if you are using by the treeview widget or the tree com&#8208;
       mand.  Ids are recycled when the node deleted.

       A node may also have any number of tags associated with  it.   A  tag  is
       just  a  string of characters, and it may take any form except that of an
       integer.  For example, &quot;x123&quot; is valid, but &quot;123&quot; isn&apos;t.   The  same  tag
       may  be  associated with many different nodes.  This is typically done to
       associate a group of nodes.  Many operations in the treeview widget  take
       either node ids or tag names as arguments.  Using a tag says to apply the
       operation to all nodes with that tag.

       The tag all is implicitly associated with every node in the tree.  It may
       be used to invoke operations on all the nodes in the tree.

       Tags  may  be shared, just like trees, between clients.  For example, you
       can use the tags created by the tree command with treeview widgets.

SPECIAL NODE IDS
       There are also several special non-numeric ids.  Special ids differ  from
       tags  in  that  they  are  always translated to their numeric equivalent.
       They also take precedence over tags.  For example, you can&apos;t  use  a  tag
       name  that  is a special id.  These ids are specific to the treeview wid&#8208;
       get.

       active         The node where the mouse  pointer  is  currently  located.
                      When  a  node is active, it is drawn using its active icon
                      (see the -activeicon option).  The active  id  is  changed
                      automatically  by  moving  the  mouse pointer over another
                      node or by using the entry activate operation.  Note  that
                      there can be only one active node at a time.

       anchor         The  node representing the fixed end of the current selec&#8208;
                      tion.  The anchor is set by the  selection  anchor  opera&#8208;
                      tion.

       current        The  node  where  the  mouse pointer is currently located.
                      But unlike active, this id changes while the selection  is
                      dragged.   It is used to determine the current node during
                      button drags.
&#12;       down           The next open node from the current focus. The down of the
                      last open node is the same.

       end            The last open node (in depth-first order) on the tree.

       focus          The node that currently has focus.  When a node has focus,
                      it receives key events.  To indicate focus,  the  node  is
                      drawn with a dotted line around its label.  You can change
                      the focus using the focus operation.

       last           The last open node from the current focus. But unlike  up,
                      when  the  focus is at root, last wraps around to the last
                      open node in the tree.

       mark           The node representing the non-fixed  end  of  the  current
                      selection.   The  mark is set by the selection mark opera&#8208;
                      tion.

       next           The next open node from the  current  focus.   But  unlike
                      down,  when  the  focus  is  on last open node, next wraps
                      around to the root node.

       nextsibling    The next sibling from the node with the current focus.  If
                      the  node  is  already  the  last  sibling  then it is the
                      nextsibling.

       parent         The parent of the node with the current focus. The  parent
                      of the root is also the root.

       prevsibling    The previous sibling from the node with the current focus.
                      If the node is already the first sibling then  it  is  the
                      prevsibling.

       root           The root node. You can also use id 0 to indicate the root.

       up             The last open node (in depth-first order) from the current
                      focus. The up of the root node (i.e. the root  has  focus)
                      is also the root.

       view.top       First node that&apos;s current visible in the widget.

       view.bottom    Last node that&apos;s current visible in the widget.

       path           Absolute  path  of  a  node.  Path names refer to the node
                      name, not their entry labels. Paths don&apos;t  have  to  start
                      with   a   separator  (see  the  -separator  configuration
                      option), but component names must be separated by the des&#8208;
                      ignated separator.

       @x,y           Indicates  the  node that covers the point in the treeview
                      window specified by x and y (in pixel coordinates).  If no
                      part  of  the  entryd  covers that point, then the closest
                      node to that point is used.

       A node may be specified as an id or tag. If the specifier is  an  integer
       then  it  is  assumed  to  refer to the single node with that id.  If the
       specifier is not an integer, it&apos;s checked to see if  it&apos;s  a  special  id
       (such  as  focus).   Otherwise,  it&apos;s assumed to be tag.  Some operations
       only operate on a single node at a time; if a tag refers to more than one
       node, then an error is generated.

DATA FIELDS
       A  node  in  the tree can have data fields.  A data field is a name-value
       pair, used to represent arbitrary data in the node.   Nodes  can  contain
       different  fields (they aren&apos;t required to contain the same fields).  You
       can optionally display these fields in the  treeview  widget  in  columns
       running  on  either  side  of the displayed tree.  A node&apos;s value for the
       field is drawn in the column along side its node in the  hierarchy.   Any
       node  that  doesn&apos;t  have a specific field is left blank.  Columns can be
       interactively resized, hidden, or, moved.

ENTRY BINDINGS
       You can bind Tcl commands to be invoked when events occur on nodes  (much
       like Tk canvas items).  You can bind a node using its id or its bindtags.
       Bindtags are simply names that associate  a  binding  with  one  or  more
       nodes.   There  is a built-in tag all that all node entries automatically
       have.

TREEVIEW OPERATIONS
       The treeview operations are the invoked by specifying the widget&apos;s  path&#8208;
       name,  the  operation,  and any arguments that pertain to that operation.
       The general form is:


              pathName operation ?arg arg ...?


       Operation and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.   The
       following operation are available for treeview widgets:

       pathName bbox ?-screen? tagOrId...
              Returns a list of 4 numbers, representing a bounding box of around
              the specified entries. The entries is given by one or more tagOrId
              arguments.  If the -screen flag is given, then the x-y coordinates
              of the bounding box are returned as screen coordinates,  not  vir&#8208;
              tual  coordinates.  Virtual coordinates start from 0 from the root
              node.  The returned list contains the following values.

              x           X-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the  bounding
                          box.

              y           Y-coordinate  of the upper-left corner of the bounding
                          box.

              width       Width of the bounding box.

              height      Height of the bounding box.

       pathName bind tagName ?sequence command?
              Associates command with  tagName  such  that  whenever  the  event
              sequence  given  by sequence occurs for a node with this tag, com&#8208;
              mand will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the  bind  command
              except  that it operates on treeview entries, rather than widgets.
              See the bind manual entry for complete details on sequence and the
              substitutions performed on command before invoking it.

              If  all  arguments  are  specified  then a new binding is created,
              replacing any existing binding for the same sequence and  tagName.
              If  the  first  character of command is + then command augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no command argument
              is provided then the command currently associated with tagName and
              sequence (it&apos;s an error occurs if  there&apos;s  no  such  binding)  is
              returned.  If both command and sequence are missing then a list of
              all the event sequences for which bindings have been  defined  for
              tagName.

       pathName button operation ?args?
              This  command  is  used  to  control the button selectors within a
              treeview widget.  It has several forms, depending on operation:

              pathName button activate tagOrId
                     Designates the node given by tagOrId  as  active.   When  a
                     node  is  active  it&apos;s entry is drawn using its active icon
                     (see the -activeicon option).  Note that there can be  only
                     one  active  entry  at a time.  The special id active indi&#8208;
                     cates the currently active node.

              pathName button bind tagName ?sequence command?
                     Associates command with  tagName  such  that  whenever  the
                     event  sequence given by sequence occurs for an button of a
                     node entry with this tag, command  will  be  invoked.   The
                     syntax  is similar to the bind command except that it oper&#8208;
                     ates on treeview buttons, rather than widgets. See the bind
                     manual  entry for complete details on sequence and the sub&#8208;
                     stitutions performed on command before invoking it.

                     If all arguments are specified then a new binding  is  cre&#8208;
                     ated,  replacing any existing binding for the same sequence
                     and tagName.  If the first character of command is  +  then
                     command  augments an existing binding rather than replacing
                     it.  If no command argument is provided  then  the  command
                     currently  associated  with  tagName  and sequence (it&apos;s an
                     error occurs if there&apos;s no such binding) is  returned.   If
                     both  command  and  sequence are missing then a list of all
                     the event sequences for which bindings  have  been  defined
                     for tagName.

              pathName button cget option
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given
                     by option.  Option may have any of the values  accepted  by
                     the configure operation described below.

              pathName button configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
                     Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the widget.
                     If no option is specified, returns a list describing all of
                     the  available  options  for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo
                     for information on the format of this list).  If option  is
                     specified  with  no  value, then the command returns a list
                     describing the one named option (this list will be  identi&#8208;
                     cal  to  the corresponding sublist of the value returned if
                     no option is specified).  If one or more option-value pairs
                     are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget
                     option(s) to have the given value(s);   in  this  case  the
                     command  returns  an  empty  string.   Option and value are
                     described in the section BUTTON OPTIONS below.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the  configuration  option  given  by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the config&#8208;
              ure operation described below.

       pathName close ?-recurse? tagOrId...
              Closes the node specified by  tagOrId.   In  addition,  if  a  Tcl
              script  was  specified by the -closecommand option, it is invoked.
              If the node is already closed, this command has no effect.  If the
              -recurse flag is present, each child node is recursively closed.

       pathName column operation ?args?
              The following operations are available for treeview columns.

              pathName column activate column
                     Sets  the active column to column.  Column is the name of a
                     column in the widget.  When a column is active, it&apos;s  drawn
                     using its -activetitlebackground and -activetitleforeground
                     options.  If column is the  &quot;&quot;,  then  no  column  will  be
                     active.   If  no column argument is provided, then the name
                     of the currently active column is returned.

              pathName column cget name option
                     Returns the  current  value  of  the  column  configuration
                     option  given by option for name.  Name is the name of col&#8208;
                     umn that corresponds to a data field.  Option may have  any
                     of the values accepted by the configure operation described
                     below.

              pathName column configure name ?option? ?value option value ...?
                     Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the  column
                     designated  by  name. Name is the name of the column corre&#8208;
                     sponding to a data  field.   If  no  option  is  specified,
                     returns  a list describing all of the available options for
                     pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the  for&#8208;
                     mat  of  this list).  If option is specified with no value,
                     then the command returns a list describing  the  one  named
                     option  (this  list  will be identical to the corresponding
                     sublist of the value returned if no option  is  specified).
                     If  one  or more option-value pairs are specified, then the
                     command modifies the given widget  option(s)  to  have  the
                     given  value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty
                     string.  Option and value are described in the section COL&#8208;
                     UMN OPTIONS below.

              pathName column delete field ?field...?
                     Deletes one of more columns designated by field.  Note that
                     this does not delete the data fields themselves.

              pathName column insert position field ?options...?
                     Inserts one of more columns designated by field.  A  column
                     displays  each  node&apos;s data field by the same name.  If the
                     node doesn&apos;t have the given field, the cell is left  blank.
                     Position  indicates where in the list of columns to add the
                     new column.  It may be either a number or end.

              pathName column invoke field
                     Invokes the Tcl command associated with the  column  field,
                     if  there is one (using the column&apos;s -command option).  The
                     command is ignored if the column&apos;s  -state  option  set  to
                     disabled.

              pathName column move name dest
                     Moves the column name to the destination position.  Dest is
                     the name of another column or a screen position in the form
                     @x,y.

              pathName column names
                     Returns  a  list of the names of all columns in the widget.
                     The list is ordered as the columns are drawn from  left-to-
                     right.

              pathName column nearest x ?y?
                     Returns  the  name  of  the column closest to the given X-Y
                     screen coordinate.  If  you  provide  a  y  argument  (it&apos;s
                     optional),  a  name  is  returned only when if the point is
                     over a column&apos;s title.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the  widget.   If  no
              option  is  specified, returns a list describing all of the avail&#8208;
              able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If option is specified with no value,
              then the command returns a list describing the  one  named  option
              (this  list  will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if  no  option  is  specified).   If  one  or  more
              option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the command modifies the
              given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in  this  case
              the  command  returns  an  empty  string.   Option  and  value are
              described in the section TREEVIEW OPTIONS below.

       pathName curselection
              Returns a list containing the ids of all of the entries  that  are
              currently  selected.   If  there are no entries selected, then the
              empty string is returned.

       pathName delete tagOrId...
              Deletes one or more entries given by tagOrId and its children.

       pathName entry operation ?args?
              The following operations are available for treeview entries.

              pathName entry activate tagOrId
                     Sets the active entry to  the  one  specified  by  tagOrId.
                     When  an  entry is active it is drawn using its active icon
                     (see the -activeicon option).  Note that there can be  only
                     one active node at a time.  The special id of the currently
                     active node is active.

              pathName entry cget option
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given
                     by  option.   Option may have any of the values accepted by
                     the configure operation described below.

              pathName entry children tagOrId  ?first? ?last?
                     Returns a list of ids for the given range  of  children  of
                     tagOrId.   TagOrId is the id or tag of the node to be exam&#8208;
                     ined.  If only a first argument is present, then the id  of
                     the  that  child  at that numeric position is returned.  If
                     both first and last arguments are given, then  the  ids  of
                     all the children in that range are returned.  Otherwise the
                     ids of all children are returned.

              pathName entry configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
                     Query or modify the configuration options  of  the  widget.
                     If no option is specified, returns a list describing all of
                     the available options for  pathName  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo
                     for  information on the format of this list).  If option is
                     specified with no value, then the command  returns  a  list
                     describing  the one named option (this list will be identi&#8208;
                     cal to the corresponding sublist of the value  returned  if
                     no option is specified).  If one or more option-value pairs
                     are specified, then the command modifies the  given  widget
                     option(s)  to  have  the  given value(s);  in this case the
                     command returns an empty  string.   Option  and  value  are
                     described below:

              pathName entry delete tagOrId ?first ?last?
                     Deletes  the  one  or  more  children  nodes  of the parent
                     tagOrId.  If first and last arguments are present, they are
                     positions  designating  a  range  of  children  nodes to be
                     deleted.

              pathName entry isbefore tagOrId1 tagOrId2
                     Returns 1 if tagOrId1 is before tagOrId2 and 0 otherwise.

              pathName entry ishidden tagOrId
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently hidden and 0  otherwise.
                     A  node  is  also  hidden  if any of its ancestor nodes are
                     closed or hidden.

              pathName entry isopen tagOrId
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently open and 0 otherwise.

              pathName entry size -recurse tagOrId
                     Returns the number of children for parent node tagOrId.  If
                     the -recurse flag is set, the number of all its descendants
                     is returned.  The node itself is not counted.

       pathName find ?flags? first last
              Finds for all entries matching the criteria  given  by  flags.   A
              list of ids for all matching nodes is returned. First and last are
              ids designating the range of the search in depth-first  order.  If
              last  is  before  first, then nodes are searched in reverse order.
              The valid flags are:

              -name pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              -full pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              -option pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against  the  node  entry&apos;s
                          configuration option.

              -exact      Patterns must match exactly.  The is the default.

              -glob       Use  global  pattern  matching.  Matching is done in a
                          fashion similar to that used by the C-shell.  For  the
                          two  strings  to match, their contents must be identi&#8208;
                          cal except that  the   following   special   sequences
                          may appear in pattern:

                          *    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string,
                               including a null string.

                          ?    Matches any single character in string.

                          [chars]
                               Matches any character in the set given by  chars.
                               If  a  sequence of the form x-y appears in chars,
                               then any character between x  and  y,  inclusive,
                               will match.

                          \x   Matches   the   single   character  x.  This pro&#8208;
                               vides a way of  avoiding  the  special  interpre&#8208;
                               tation of the characters *?[]\ in the pattern.

              -regexp     Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same
                          as implemented by the regexp command).

              -nonmatching
                          Pick entries that don&apos;t match.

              -exec string
                          Specifies a Tcl script to be invoked for each matching
                          node.   Percent  substitutions are performed on string
                          before it is executed.   The  following  substitutions
                          are valid:

                          %W   The pathname of the widget.

                          %p   The name of the node.

                          %P   The full pathname of the node.

                          %#   The id of the node.

                          %%   Translates to a single percent.

              -count number
                          Stop searching after number matches.

              --          Indicates the end of flags.

       pathName focus  tagOrId
              Sets  the  focus  to  the  node given by tagOrId.  When a node has
              focus, it can receive keyboard events.  The special id focus  des&#8208;
              ignates the node that currently has focus.

       pathName get ?-full? tagOrId tagOrId...
              Translates  one or more ids to their node entry names.  It returns
              a list of names for all the ids specified.  If the -full  flag  is
              set, then the full pathnames are returned.

       pathName hide ?flags? tagOrId...
              Hides  all nodes matching the criteria given by flags.  The search
              is performed recursively for each  node  given  by  tagOrId.   The
              valid flags are described below:

              -name pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              -full pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              -option pattern
                          Specifies  pattern  to  match against the node entry&apos;s
                          configuration option.

              -exact      Match patterns exactly.  The is the default.

              -glob       Use global pattern matching.  Matching is  done  in  a
                          fashion similar to that used by the C-shell.  For  the
                          two strings  to match, their contents must be  identi&#8208;

                          may appear in pattern:

                          *    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string,
                               including a null string.

                          ?    Matches any single character in string.

                          [chars]
                               Matches  any character in the set given by chars.
                               If a sequence of the form x-y appears  in  chars,
                               then  any  character  between x and y, inclusive,
                               will match.

                          \x   Matches  the  single  character   x.   This  pro&#8208;

                          as implemented by the regexp command).

              -nonmatching
                          Hide nodes that don&apos;t match.

              --          Indicates the end of flags.

       pathName index ?-at tagOrId? string
              Returns  the  id of the node specified by string.  String may be a
              tag or node id.  Some special ids are  normally  relative  to  the
              node that has focus.  The -at flag lets you select another node.

       pathName   insert   ?-at   tagOrId?  position  path  ?options...?  ?path?
       ?options...?
              Inserts one or more nodes at position.  Position is  the  location
              (number  or end) where the new nodes are added to the parent node.
              Path is the pathname of the new node.  Pathnames can  be  formated
              either  as  a  Tcl list (each element is a path component) or as a
              string separated by a special character sequence (using the -sepa&#8208;
              rator  option).   Pathnames  are  normally  absolute,  but the -at
              switch lets you select a relative starting point.   Its  value  is
              the id of the starting node.

              All  ancestors  of  the  new  node  must already exist, unless the
              -autocreate option is set.  It is also an error if a node  already
              exists, unless the -allowduplicates option is set.

              Option  and value may have any of the values accepted by the entry
              configure operation described  in  the  ENTRY  OPERATIONS  section
              below.  This command returns a list of the ids of the new entries.

       pathName move tagOrId how destId
              Moves the node given by tagOrId to the destination node.  The node
              can not be an ancestor of the destination.  DestId is  the  id  of
              the destination node and can not be the root of the tree.  In con&#8208;
              junction with how, it describes how the move is performed.

              before  Moves the node before the destination node.

              after   Moves the node after the destination node.

              into    Moves the node to the end of  the  destination&apos;s  list  of
                      children.

       pathName nearest x y ?varName?
              Returns  the  id of the node entry closest to the given X-Y screen
              coordinate.  The optional argument varName is the name of variable
              which is set to either button or select to indicate over what part
              of the node  the  coordinate  lies.   If  the  coordinate  is  not
              directly  over  any  node,  then  varName  will  contain the empty
              string.

       pathName open ?-recurse? tagOrId...
              Opens the one or more nodes specified by tagOrId.  If  a  node  is
              not  already  open,  the  Tcl script specified by the -opencommand
              option is invoked. If the -recurse  flag  is  present,  then  each
              descendant is recursively opened.

       pathName range ?-open? first last
              Returns  the  ids  in  depth-first  order of the nodes between the
              first and last ids.  If the -open flag is present, it indicates to
              consider  only  open nodes.  If last is before first, then the ids
              are returned in reverse order.

       pathName scan option args
              This command implements scanning.  It has two forms, depending  on
              option:

              pathName scan mark x y
                     Records  x  and y and the current view in the treeview win&#8208;
                     dow;  used in conjunction with later scan dragto  commands.
                     Typically  this  command  is associated with a mouse button
                     press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              pathName scan dragto x y.
                     Computes the difference between its x and y  arguments  and
                     the x and y arguments to the last scan mark command for the
                     widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10 times  the  differ&#8208;
                     ence  in coordinates.  This command is typically associated
                     with mouse motion events in  the  widget,  to  produce  the
                     effect  of dragging the list at high speed through the win&#8208;
                     dow.  The return value is an empty string.

       pathName see ?-anchor anchor? tagOrId
              Adjusts the view of entries so that the node given by  tagOrId  is
              visible  in the widget window.  It is an error if tagOrId is a tag
              that refers to more than one node.  By default the node&apos;s entry is
              displayed in the middle of the window.  This can changed using the
              -anchor flag.  Its value is a Tk anchor position.

       pathName selection option arg
              This command is used to adjust the  selection  within  a  treeview
              widget.  It has several forms, depending on option:

              pathName selection anchor tagOrId
                     Sets the selection anchor to the node given by tagOrId.  If
                     tagOrId refers to a non-existent  node,  then  the  closest
                     node  is  used.   The  selection  anchor  is the end of the
                     selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with
                     the  mouse.   The special id anchor may be used to refer to
                     the anchor node.

              pathName selection cancel
                     Clears the temporary selection of entries back to the  cur&#8208;
                     rent  anchor.   Temporary  selections  are  created  by the
                     selection mark operation.

              pathName selection clear first ?last?
                     Removes the entries between first and last (inclusive) from
                     the  selection.  Both first and last are ids representing a
                     range of entries.  If last isn&apos;t given, then only first  is
                     deselected.    Entries   outside   the  selection  are  not
                     affected.

              pathName selection clearall
                     Clears the entire selection.

              pathName selection mark tagOrId
                     Sets the selection mark to the node given by tagOrId.  This
                     causes the range of entries between the anchor and the mark
                     to be temporarily added to the  selection.   The  selection
                     mark  is the end of the selection that is fixed while drag&#8208;
                     ging out a selection with the mouse.  The special  id  mark
                     may  be used to refer to the current mark node.  If tagOrId
                     refers to a non-existent node, then the  mark  is  ignored.
                     Resetting  the mark will unselect the previous range.  Set&#8208;
                     ting the anchor finalizes the range.

              pathName selection includes tagOrId
                     Returns 1  if  the  node  given  by  tagOrId  is  currently
                     selected, 0 if it isn&apos;t.

              pathName selection present
                     Returns  1 if any nodes are currently selected and 0 other&#8208;
                     wise.

              pathName selection set first ?last?
                     Selects all of the nodes in the  range  between  first  and
                     last,  inclusive,  without affecting the selection state of
                     nodes outside that range.

              pathName selection toggle first ?last?
                     Selects/deselects nodes in  the  range  between  first  and
                     last,  inclusive,  from  the  selection.  If a node is cur&#8208;
                     rently selected, it becomes deselected, and visa versa.

       pathName show ?flags? tagOrId...
              Exposes all nodes matching the criteria given by flags.   This  is
              the inverse of the hide operation.  The search is performed recur&#8208;
              sively for each node  given  by  tagOrId.   The  valid  flags  are
              described below:

              -name pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              -full pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              -option pattern
                          Specifies pattern to match against the entry&apos;s config&#8208;
                          uration option.

              -exact      Match patterns exactly.  The is the default.

              -glob       -glob Use global pattern matching.  Matching  is  done
                          in a fashion similar to that used by the C-shell.  For
                          the  two strings  to match,  their  contents  must  be
                          identical   except   that   the    following   special
                          sequences  may appear in pattern:

                          *    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string,
                               including a null string.

                          ?    Matches any single character in string.

                          [chars]
                               Matches  any character in the set given by chars.
                               If a sequence of the form x-y appears  in  chars,
                               then  any  character  between x and y, inclusive,
                               will match.

                          \x   Matches  the  single  character   x.   This  pro&#8208;
                               vides  a way of  avoiding  the  special interpre&#8208;
                               tation of the characters *?[]\ in the pattern.

              -regexp     Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same
                          as implemented by the regexp command).

              -nonmatching
                          Expose nodes that don&apos;t match.

              --          Indicates the end of flags.

       pathName sort ?operation? args...

              pathName sort auto ?boolean
                     Turns on/off automatic sorting of node entries.  If boolean
                     is true, entries will be automatically sorted as  they  are
                     opened,  closed, inserted, or deleted.  If no boolean argu&#8208;
                     ment is provided, the current state is returned.

              pathName sort cget option
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given
                     by  option.   Option may have any of the values accepted by
                     the configure operation described below.

              pathName sort configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
                     Query or modify the sorting configuration  options  of  the
                     widget.  If no option is specified, returns a list describ&#8208;
                     ing all of the available options for pathName (see  Tk_Con&#8208;
                     figureInfo for information on the format of this list).  If
                     option is specified with no value, then the command returns
                     a  list  describing the one named option (this list will be
                     identical  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the   value
                     returned  if  no  option  is  specified).   If  one or more
                     option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies
                     the given sorting option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
                     this case the command returns an empty string.  Option  and
                     value are described below:

                     -column string
                            Specifies  the column to sort. Entries in the widget
                            are rearranged according to this column.  If  column
                            is &quot;&quot; then no sort is performed.

                     -command string
                            Specifies  a Tcl procedure to be called when sorting
                            nodes.  The procedure is  called  with  three  argu&#8208;
                            ments:  the pathname of the widget and the fields of
                            two entries.  The procedure returns 1 if  the  first
                            node is greater than the second, -1 is the second is
                            greater, and 0 if equal.

                     -decreasing boolean
                            Indicates to sort in ascending/descending order.  If
                            boolean  is  true, then the entries as in descending
                            order. The default is no.

                     -mode string
                            Specifies  how  to  compare  entries  when  sorting.
                            String may be one of the following:

                            ascii          Use  string comparison based upon the
                                           ASCII collation order.

                            dictionary     Use   dictionary-style    comparison.
                                           This  is the same as ascii except (a)
                                           case is  ignored  except  as  a  tie-
                                           breaker  and  (b) if two strings con&#8208;
                                           tain embedded  numbers,  the  numbers
                                           compare  as integers, not characters.
                                           For example, &quot;bigBoy&quot;  sorts  between
                                           &quot;bigbang&quot;  and  &quot;bigboy&quot;,  and &quot;x10y&quot;
                                           sorts between &quot;x9y&quot; and &quot;x11y&quot;.

                            integer        Compares fields as integers.

                            real           Compares  fields  as  floating  point
                                           numbers.

                            command        Use  the  Tcl  proc  specified by the
                                           -command option  to  compare  entries
                                           when  sorting.    If  no  command  is
                                           specified, the sort reverts to  ascii
                                           sorting.

              pathName sort once ?flags? tagOrId...
                     Sorts  the  children for each entries specified by tagOrId.
                     By default, entries are sorted by name, but you can specify
                     a Tcl proc to do your own comparisons.

                     -recurse       Recursively sort the entire branch, not just
                                    the children.

       pathName tag operation args
              Tags are a general means of selecting and  marking  nodes  in  the
              tree.   A  tag is just a string of characters, and it may take any
              form except that of an integer.  The same tag  may  be  associated
              with many different nodes.

              Both  operation  and its arguments determine the exact behavior of
              the command.  The operations available for tags are listed below.

              pathName tag add string id...
                     Adds the tag string to one of more entries.

              pathName tag delete string id...
                     Deletes the tag string from one or more entries.

              pathName tag forget string
                     Removes the tag string from all entries.  It&apos;s not an error
                     if no entries are tagged as string.

              pathName tag names ?id?
                     Returns a list of tags used.  If an id argument is present,
                     only those tags used by  the  node  designated  by  id  are
                     returned.

              pathName tag nodes string
                     Returns a list of ids that have the tag string.  If no node
                     is tagged as string, then an empty string is returned.

       pathName text operation ?args?
              This operation is used to provide text  editing  for  cells  (data
              fields  in  a  column)  or  entry  labels.   It has several forms,
              depending on operation:

              pathName text apply
                     Applies the edited buffer, replacing  the  entry  label  or
                     data field. The edit window is hidden.

              pathName text cancel
                     Cancels the editing operation, reverting the entry label or
                     data value back to the previous value. The edit  window  is
                     hidden.
&#12;              pathName text cget value
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given
                     by option.  Option may have any of the values  accepted  by
                     the configure operation described below.

              pathName text configure ?option value?
                     Query  or modify the configuration options of the edit win&#8208;
                     dow.  If no option is specified, returns a list  describing
                     all  of  the  available  options  (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
                     information on the format of  this  list).   If  option  is
                     specified  with  no  value, then the command returns a list
                     describing the one named option (this list will be  identi&#8208;
                     cal  to  the corresponding sublist of the value returned if
                     no option is specified).  If one or more option-value pairs
                     are  specified,  then the command modifies the given widget
                     option(s) to have the given value(s);   in  this  case  the
                     command  returns  an  empty  string.   Option and value are
                     described in the section TEXT EDITING OPTIONS below.

       pathName text delete first last
              Deletes the characters in the edit buffer between  the  two  given
              character positions.

       pathName text get ?-root? x y

       pathName text icursor index

       pathName text index index
              Returns the text index of given index.

       pathName text insert index string
              Insert  the  text  string string into the edit buffer at the index
              index.  For example, the index 0 will prepend the buffer.

       pathName text selection args
              This operation controls the selection of the editing window.  Note
              that  this differs from the selection of entries.  It has the fol&#8208;
              lowing forms:

              pathName text selection adjust index
                     Adjusts either the first or last index of the selection.

              pathName text selection clear
                     Clears the selection.

              pathName text selection from index
                     Sets the anchor of the selection.

              pathName text selection present
                     Indicates if a selection is present.

              pathName text selection range start end
                     Sets both the anchor and mark of the selection.

              pathName text selection to index
                     Sets the unanchored end (mark) of the selection.

       pathName toggle tagOrId
              Opens or closes the node given by tagOrId.  If  the  corresponding
              -opencommand  or -closecommand option is set, then that command is
              also invoked.

       pathName xview args
              This command is used to query and change the  horizontal  position
              of the information in the widget&apos;s window.  It can take any of the
              following forms:

              pathName xview
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is  a
                     real  fraction between 0 and 1;  together they describe the
                     horizontal span that is visible in the window.   For  exam&#8208;
                     ple,  if  the first element is .2 and the second element is
                     .6, 20% of the treeview widget&apos;s text is off-screen to  the
                     left,  the  middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of
                     the text is off-screen to the right.  These  are  the  same
                     values passed to scrollbars via the -xscrollcommand option.

              pathName xview tagOrId
                     Adjusts  the view in the window so that the character posi&#8208;
                     tion given by tagOrId is displayed at the left edge of  the
                     window.   Character  positions  are defined by the width of
                     the character 0.

              pathName xview moveto fraction
                     Adjusts the view in the window  so  that  fraction  of  the
                     total  width of the treeview widget&apos;s text is off-screen to
                     the left.  fraction must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              pathName xview scroll number what
                     This command shifts the view in the window  left  or  right
                     according  to  number and what.  Number must be an integer.
                     What must be either units or pages or  an  abbreviation  of
                     one  of  these.  If what is units, the view adjusts left or
                     right by number character units (the width of the 0 charac&#8208;
                     ter)  on the display;  if it is pages then the view adjusts
                     by number screenfuls.  If number is negative  then  charac&#8208;
                     ters farther to the left become visible;  if it is positive
                     then characters farther to the right become visible.

       pathName yview ?args?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position  of
              the text in the widget&apos;s window.  It can take any of the following
              forms:

              pathName yview
                     Returns a list containing two elements, both of  which  are
                     real  fractions  between  0 and 1.  The first element gives
                     the position of the node at the top of the window, relative
                     to  the  widget as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through
                     the treeview window,  for  example).   The  second  element
                     gives  the  position of the node just after the last one in
                     the window, relative to the widget as a whole.   These  are
                     the  same  values passed to scrollbars via the -yscrollcom&#8208;
                     mand option.

              pathName yview tagOrId
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the  node  given  by
                     tagOrId is displayed at the top of the window.

              pathName yview moveto fraction
                     Adjusts  the  view  in the window so that the node given by
                     fraction appears at the top of the window.  Fraction  is  a
                     fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first node, 0.33
                     indicates the node one-third the way through  the  treeview
                     widget, and so on.

              pathName yview scroll number what
                     This  command  adjusts  the  view  in the window up or down
                     according to number and what.  Number must be  an  integer.
                     What  must be either units or pages.  If what is units, the
                     view adjusts up or down by number lines;  if  it  is  pages
                     then  the  view adjusts by number screenfuls.  If number is
                     negative then earlier nodes become visible;  if it is posi&#8208;
                     tive then later nodes become visible.

TREEVIEW OPTIONS
       In  addition to the configure operation, widget configuration options may
       also be set by the Tk option command.  The class resource name  is  Tree&#8208;
       View.

       -relief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect for the widget.  Relief specifies how the
              treeview  widget  should  appear  relative  to widget it is packed
              into; for example, raised means the treeview widget should  appear
              to protrude.  The default is sunken.

       -scrollmode mode
              Specifies the style of scrolling to be used.  The following styles
              are valid.  This is the default is hierbox.

              listbox     Like the listbox widget, the last entry can always  be
                          scrolled to the top of the widget window.  This allows
                          the scrollbar thumb to shrink as  the  last  entry  is
                          scrolled upward.

              hierbox     Like  the  hierbox  widget, the last entry can only be
                          viewed at  the  bottom  of  the  widget  window.   The
                          scrollbar stays a constant size.

              canvas      Like  the  canvas widget, the entries are bound within
                          the scrolling area.

              Sets the background color selected node entries.  The  default  is
              #ffffea.

       -selectborderwidth pixels
              Sets the width of the raised 3-D border drawn around the labels of
              selected entries. The default is 0.  -selectcommand string  Speci&#8208;
              fies  a  Tcl  script  to  invoked  when  the set of selected nodes
              changes.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -selectforeground color
              Sets the color of  the  labels  of  selected  node  entries.   The
              default is black.

       -selectmode mode
              Specifies the selection mode. If mode is single, only one node can
              be selected at a time.  If multiple more  than  one  node  can  be
              selected.  The default is single.

       -separator string
              Specifies  the  character  sequence to use when splitting the path
              components.  The separator may be several characters wide (such as
              &quot;::&quot;) Consecutive separators in a pathname are treated as one.  If
              string is the empty string, the pathnames  are  Tcl  lists.   Each
              element is a path component.   The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -showtitles boolean
              If  boolean  is  false,  column  titles are not be displayed.  The
              default is yes.

       -sortselection boolean
              If boolean is true, nodes in the selection are ordered as they are
              currently displayed (depth-first or sorted), not in the order they
              were selected. The default is no.

       -takefocus focus
              Provides information used when moving the  focus  from  window  to
              window via keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If focus
              is 0, this means that this window should be skipped entirely  dur&#8208;
              ing  keyboard  traversal.   1  means  that  the this window should
              always receive the input focus.  An empty  value  means  that  the
              traversal  scripts  make the decision whether to focus on the win&#8208;
              dow.  The default is &quot;1&quot;.

       -trim string
              Specifies a string leading characters to trim from entry pathnames
              before  parsing.   This only makes sense if the -separator is also
              set.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -width pixels
              Sets the requested width of the widget.  If pixels is 0, then  the
              with  is  computed  from the contents of the treeview widget.  The
              default is 200.

       -xscrollcommand string
              Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with  hori&#8208;
              zontal  scrollbars.   Whenever the horizontal view in the widget&apos;s
              window changes, the widget will generate a Tcl command by concate&#8208;
              nating  the scroll command and two numbers.  If this option is not
              specified, then no command will be executed.

       -xscrollincrement pixels
              Sets the horizontal scrolling distance. The default is 20 pixels.

       -yscrollcommand string
              Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with verti&#8208;
              cal  scrollbars.   Whenever the vertical view in the widget&apos;s win&#8208;
              dow changes, the widget will generate a Tcl command by concatenat&#8208;
              ing  the  scroll  command  and two numbers.  If this option is not
              specified, then no command will be executed.

       -yscrollincrement pixels
              Sets the vertical scrolling distance. The default is 20 pixels.

ENTRY OPTIONS
       Many widget configuration options  have  counterparts  in  entries.   For
       example,  there  is  a -closecommand configuration option for both widget
       itself and for individual entries.  Options set at the widget  level  are
       global  for  all entries.  If the entry configuration option is set, then
       it overrides the widget option.  This is done to avoid wasting memory  by
       replicated options.  Most entries will have redundant options.

       There is no resource class or name for entries.

       -activeicons images
              Specifies  images  to  be displayed as the entry&apos;s icon when it is
              active.  This  overrides  the  global  -activeicons  configuration
              option for the specific entry.  Images is a list of two Tk images:
              the first image is displayed when the node  is  open,  the  second
              when it is closed.

       -bindtags tagList
              Specifies  the binding tags for nodes.  TagList is a list of bind&#8208;
              ing tag names.  The tags and their order will determine how events
              are  handled for nodes.  Each tag in the list matching the current
              event sequence will have its Tcl command  executed.   The  default
              value is all.

       -button string
              Indicates whether a button should be displayed on the left side of
              the node entry.  String can be yes, no, or auto.  If auto, then  a
              button  is automatically displayed if the node has children.  This
              is the default.

       -closecommand string
              Specifies a Tcl script to be invoked  when  the  node  is  closed.
              This  overrides  the  global  -closecommand option for this entry.
              The default is &quot;&quot;.  Percent substitutions are performed on  string
              before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

              %W   The pathname of the widget.

              %p   The name of the node.

              %P   The full pathname of the node.

              %#   The id of the node.

              %%   Translates to a single percent.
&#12;       -data string
              Sets  data  fields  for  the node.  String is a list of name-value
              pairs to be set. The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -font fontName
              Sets the font for entry labels.  This overrides the widget&apos;s -font
              option  for  this  node.   The  default is *-Helvetica-Bold-R-Nor&#8208;
              mal-*-12-120-*.

       -foreground color
              Sets the text color of the entry label.  This overrides  the  wid&#8208;
              get&apos;s -foreground configuration option.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -icons images
              Specifies images to be displayed for the entry&apos;s icon.  This over&#8208;
              rides the global -icons configuration option.  Images is a list of
              two Tk images: the first image is displayed when the node is open,
              the second when it is closed.

       -label string
              Sets the text for the entry&apos;s label.  If not set, this defaults to
              the name of the node. The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -opencommand string
              Specifies  a  Tcl  script  to be invoked when the entry is opened.
              This overrides the widget&apos;s -opencommand  option  for  this  node.
              The  default is &quot;&quot;.  Percent substitutions are performed on string
              before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

              %W   The pathname of the widget.

              %p   The name of the node.

              %P   The full pathname of the node.

              %#   The id of the node.

              %%   Translates to a single percent.

BUTTON OPTIONS
       Button configuration options may also be set by the option command.   The
       resource subclass is Button.   The resource name is always button.

              option add *TreeView.Button.Foreground white
              option add *TreeView.button.Background blue

       The following are the configuration options available for buttons.

       -activebackground color
              Sets  the  background  color  of active buttons.  A button is made
              active when the mouse passes over it or  by  the  button  activate
              operation.

       -activeforeground color
              Sets  the  foreground  color  of active buttons.  A button is made
              active when the mouse passes over it or  by  the  button  activate
              operation.

       -background color
              Sets the background of the button.  The default is white.

       -borderwidth pixels
              Sets  the  width of the 3-D border around the button.  The -relief
              option determines if a border is to be drawn.  The default is 1.

       -closerelief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect for the closed button.  Relief  indicates
              how  the button should appear relative to the widget; for example,
              raised means the button should appear to protrude.  The default is
              solid.

       -cursor cursor
              Sets the widget&apos;s cursor.  The default cursor is &quot;&quot;.
&#12;       -foreground color
              Sets the foreground color of buttons.  The default is black.

       -images images
              Specifies images to be displayed for the button.  Images is a list
              of two Tk images: the first image is displayed when the button  is
              open,  the  second  when it is closed.  If the images is the empty
              string, then a plus/minus gadget is drawn.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -openrelief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect of the open button.  Relief indicates how
              the  button  should  appear  relative  to the widget; for example,
              raised means the button should appear to protrude.  The default is
              flat.

       -size pixels
              Sets the requested size of the button.  The default is 0.

COLUMN OPTIONS
       Column  configuration options may also be set by the option command.  The
       resource subclass is Column.   The resource name is the name of the  col&#8208;
       umn.

              option add *TreeView.Column.Foreground white
              option add *TreeView.treeView.Background blue

       The following configuration options are available for columns.

       -background color
              Sets  the background color of the column.  This overrides the wid&#8208;
              get&apos;s -background option. The default is white.

       -borderwidth pixels
              Sets the width of the 3-D  border  of  the  column.   The  -relief
              option determines if a border is to be drawn.  The default is 0.

       -edit boolean
              Indicates if the column&apos;s data fields can be edited. If boolean is
              false, the data fields in the  column  may  not  be  edited.   The
              default is yes.

       -foreground color
              Specifies  the  foreground  color of the column.  You can override
              this for individual entries with the entry&apos;s  -foreground  option.
              The default is black.

       -font fontName
              Sets  the font for a column.  You can override this for individual
              entries with the entry&apos;s -font  option.   The  default  is  *-Hel&#8208;
              vetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-12-120-*.

       -hide boolean
              If  boolean  is true, the column is not displayed.  The default is
              yes.

       -justify justify
              Specifies how the column data fields  title  should  be  justified
              within  the  column.   This  matters only when the column is wider
              than the data field to be display.  Justify must be  left,  right,
              or center.  The default is left.

       -pad pad
              Specifies  how  much  padding  for the left and right sides of the
              column.  Pad is a list of one or two screen distances.  If pad has
              two  elements,  the left side of the column is padded by the first
              distance and the right side by the second.  If pad  has  just  one
              distance,  both  the  left and right sides are padded evenly.  The
              default is 2.

       -relief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect of the column.  Relief specifies how  the
              column  should  appear relative to the widget; for example, raised
              means the column should appear to protrude.  The default is flat.
&#12;       -state state
              Sets the state of the column. If state is disable then the  column
              title can not be activated nor invoked.  The default is normal.

       -text string
              Sets the title for the column.  The default is &quot;&quot;.

       -titleforeground color
              Sets  the  foreground  color  of the column title.  The default is
              black.

       -titleshadow color
              Sets the color of the  drop  shadow  of  the  column  title.   The
              default is &quot;&quot;.

       -width pixels
              Sets  the  requested width of the column.  This overrides the com&#8208;
              puted with of the column.  If pixels is 0, the width  is  computed
              as from the contents of the column. The default is 0.

TEXT EDITING OPTIONS
       Text edit window configuration options may also be set by the option com&#8208;
       mand. The resource class is TreeViewEditor.  The resource name is  always
       edit.

              option add *TreeViewEditor.Foreground white
              option add *edit.Background blue

       The  following are the configuration options available for the text edit&#8208;
       ing window.

       -background color
              Sets the background of the  text  edit  window.   The  default  is
              white.

       -borderwidth pixels
              Sets  the  width  of  the  3-D border around the edit window.  The
              -relief option determines if a border is to be drawn.  The default
              is 1.

       -exportselection boolean
              Indicates  if  the text selection is exported.  If the edit window
              is exporting its selection then it will observe the  standard  X11
              protocols for handling the selection.  Selections are available as
              type STRING.  The default is no.

       -relief relief
              Specifies the 3-D effect of the edit window.  Relief indicates how
              the  background  should  appear  relative  to the edit window; for
              example, raised means the background should  appear  to  protrude.
              The default is solid.

       -selectbackground color
              Sets  the background of the selected text in the edit window.  The
              default is white.

       -selectborderwidth pixels
              Sets the width of the 3-D border around the selected text  in  the
              edit  window.   The -selectrelief option determines if a border is
              to be drawn.  The default is 1.

       -selectforeground color
              Sets the foreground of the selected text in the edit window.   The
              default is white.

       -selectrelief relief
              Specifies  the 3-D effect of the selected text in the edit window.
              Relief indicates how the text should appear relative to  the  edit
              window;  for  example, raised means the text should appear to pro&#8208;
              trude.  The default is flat.

DEFAULT BINDINGS
       Tk automatically creates class bindings  for  treeviews  that  give  them
       Motif-like behavior.  Much of the behavior of a treeview widget is deter&#8208;
       mined by its -selectmode option, which selects one of two ways of dealing
       with the selection.

       If the selection mode is single, only one node can be selected at a time.
       Clicking button 1 on an node selects it and deselects any other  selected
       item.

       If  the selection mode is multiple, any number of entries may be selected
       at once, including discontiguous ranges.  Clicking Control-Button-1 on  a
       node  entry  toggles  its  selection  state  without  affecting any other
       entries.  Pressing Shift-Button-1 on a node entry selects it, extends the
       selection.

       [1]    In  extended  mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing
              button 1 with the Shift key down:  this modifies the selection  to
              consist  of the entries between the anchor and the entry under the
              mouse, inclusive.  The un-anchored end of this new  selection  can
              also be dragged with the button down.

       [2]    In  extended  mode,  pressing  button  1 with the Control key down
              starts a toggle operation: the anchor is set to  the  entry  under
              the  mouse,  and  its  selection state is reversed.  The selection
              state of other entries isn&apos;t changed.  If  the  mouse  is  dragged
              with  button  1  down,  then  the  selection  state of all entries
              between the anchor and the entry under the mouse is set  to  match
              that  of  the  anchor  entry;   the  selection  state of all other
              entries remains what it was before the toggle operation began.

       [3]    If the mouse leaves the treeview window with button  1  down,  the
              window  scrolls  away  from  the mouse, making information visible
              that used to  be  off-screen  on  the  side  of  the  mouse.   The
              scrolling continues until the mouse re-enters the window, the but&#8208;
              ton is released, or the end of the hierarchy is reached.

       [4]    Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If  it  is  pressed  and
              dragged  over  the  treeview widget, the contents of the hierarchy
              drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       [5]    If the Up or Down key is  pressed,  the  location  cursor  (active
              entry)  moves  up  or  down  one  entry.  If the selection mode is
              browse or extended then the new active entry is also selected  and
              all other entries are deselected.  In extended mode the new active
              entry becomes the selection anchor.

       [6]    In extended mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor
              (active  entry) up or down one entry and also extend the selection
              to that entry in a fashion similar to dragging with  mouse  button
              1.

       [7]    The  Left  and Right keys scroll the treeview widget view left and
              right by the width of the character 0.  Control-Left and  Control-
              Right  scroll the treeview widget view left and right by the width
              of the window.  Control-Prior and Control-Next  also  scroll  left
              and right by the width of the window.

       [8]    The  Prior  and  Next  keys scroll the treeview widget view up and
              down by one page (the height of the window).

       [9]    The Home and End keys scroll the treeview widget  horizontally  to
              the left and right edges, respectively.

       [10]   Control-Home  sets  the  location  cursor  to the the first entry,
              selects that entry, and deselects everything else in the widget.

       [11]   Control-End sets the  location  cursor  to  the  the  last  entry,
              selects that entry, and deselects everything else in the widget.

       [12]   In  extended mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the
              first entry and Control-Shift-End extends  the  selection  to  the
              last entry.

       [13]   In  multiple mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the location cursor to
              the first entry and Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to
              the last entry.

       [14]   The  space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor
              (active entry) just as if mouse button 1  had  been  pressed  over
              this entry.

       [15]   In  extended mode, Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the
              selection to the active entry just as if button 1 had been pressed
              with the Shift key down.

       [16]   In extended mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection
              and restores all the entries in the selected range to their previ&#8208;
              ous selection state.

       [17]   Control-slash  selects  everything in the widget, except in single
              and browse modes, in which case it selects the  active  entry  and
              deselects everything else.

       [18]   Control-backslash  deselects  everything  in the widget, except in
              browse mode where it has no effect.

       [19]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many  Sun  workstations)  or  Meta-w
              copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
              selection.

       The behavior of treeview widgets can be changed by defining new  bindings
       for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.

   WIDGET BINDINGS
       In  addition  to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is
       defined by the default widget class (TreeView) bindings.

       &lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;
              Starts scanning.

       &lt;B2-Motion&gt;
              Adjusts the scan.

       &lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;
              Stops scanning.

       &lt;B1-Leave&gt;
              Starts auto-scrolling.

       &lt;B1-Enter&gt;
              Starts auto-scrolling

       &lt;KeyPress-Up&gt;
              Moves the focus to the previous entry.

       &lt;KeyPress-Down&gt;
              Moves the focus to the next entry.

       &lt;Shift-KeyPress-Up&gt;
              Moves the focus to the previous sibling.

       &lt;Shift-KeyPress-Down&gt;
              Moves the focus to the next sibling.

       &lt;KeyPress-Prior&gt;
              Moves the focus to first entry.   Closed  or  hidden  entries  are
              ignored.

       &lt;KeyPress-Next&gt;
              Move  the  focus  to  the last entry. Closed or hidden entries are
              ignored.

       &lt;KeyPress-Left&gt;
              Closes the entry.  It is not an error if the entry  has  no  chil&#8208;
              dren.

       &lt;KeyPress-Right&gt;
              Opens  the  entry, displaying its children.  It is not an error if
              the entry has no children.
&#12;       &lt;KeyPress-space&gt;
              In &quot;single&quot; select mode this selects  the  entry.   In  &quot;multiple&quot;
              mode, it toggles the entry (if it was previous selected, it is not
              deselected).

       &lt;KeyRelease-space&gt;
              Turns off select mode.

       &lt;KeyPress-Return&gt;
              Sets the focus to the current entry.

       &lt;KeyRelease-Return&gt;
              Turns off select mode.

       &lt;KeyPress&gt;
              Moves to the next entry whose label starts with the letter typed.

       &lt;KeyPress-Home&gt;
              Moves the focus to first entry.   Closed  or  hidden  entries  are
              ignored.

       &lt;KeyPress-End&gt;
              Move  the  focus  to  the last entry. Closed or hidden entries are
              ignored.

       &lt;KeyPress-F1&gt;
              Opens all entries.

       &lt;KeyPress-F2&gt;
              Closes all entries (except root).

   BUTTON BINDINGS
       Buttons have bindings.  There are associated with the &quot;all&quot; bindtag  (see
       the  entry&apos;s  -bindtag option).  You can use the bind operation to change
       them.

       &lt;Enter&gt;
              Highlights the button of the current entry.

       &lt;Leave&gt;
              Returns the button back to its normal state.

       &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;
              Adjust the view so that the current entry is visible.

   ENTRY BINDINGS
       Entries have default bindings.  There are associated with the &quot;all&quot; bind&#8208;
       tag (see the entry&apos;s -bindtag option).  You can use the bind operation to
       modify them.

       &lt;Enter&gt;
              Highlights the current entry.

       &lt;Leave&gt;
              Returns the entry back to its normal state.

              ???

       &lt;Control-Shift-Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;
              Place holder. Does nothing.

       &lt;Control-Shift-B1-Motion&gt;
              Place holder. Does nothing.

   COLUMN BINDINGS
       Columns have bindings too.  They are associated with the  column&apos;s  &quot;all&quot;
       bindtag  (see  the  column -bindtag option).  You can use the column bind
       operation to change them.

       &lt;Enter&gt;
              Highlights the current column title.

       &lt;Leave&gt;
              Returns the column back to its normal state.

       &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;
              Adjust the size of the column, based upon the  resize  anchor  and
              mark positions.

EXAMPLE
       The treeview command creates a new widget.

              treeview .h -bg white

       A  new Tcl command .h is also created.  This command can be used to query
       and modify the treeview widget.  For example, to  change  the  background
       color  of  the table to &quot;green&quot;, you use the new command and the widget&apos;s
       configure operation.

              # Change the background color.
              .h configure -background &quot;green&quot;

       By default, the treeview widget will  automatically  create  a  new  tree
       object  to contain the data.  The name of the new tree is the pathname of
       the widget.  Above, the new tree object name is &quot;.h&quot;.  But  you  can  use
       the -tree option to specify the name of another tree.

              # View the tree &quot;myTree&quot;.
              .h configure -tree &quot;myTree&quot;

       When  a  new  tree is created, it contains only a root node.  The node is
       automatically opened.  The id of the root node is always 0 (you  can  use
       also  use  the special id root). The insert operation lets you insert one
       or more new entries into the tree.  The last argument is the node&apos;s path&#8208;
       name.

              # Create a new entry named &quot;myEntry&quot;
              set id [.h insert end &quot;myEntry&quot;]

       This  appends a new node named &quot;myEntry&quot;.  It will positioned as the last
       child of the root of the tree (using the position &quot;end&quot;).  You can supply
       another position to order the node within its siblings.

              # Prepend &quot;fred&quot;.
              set id [.h insert 0 &quot;fred&quot;]

       Entry  names  do  not need to be unique.  By default, the node&apos;s label is
       its name.  To supply a different text label, add the -label option.

              # Create a new node named &quot;fred&quot;
              set id [.h insert end &quot;fred&quot; -label &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot;]

       The insert operation returns the id of the new node.  You  can  also  use
       the index operation to get this information.

              # Get the id of &quot;fred&quot;
              .h index &quot;fred&quot;

       To insert a node somewhere other than root, use the -at switch.  It takes
       the id of the node where the new child will be added.

              # Create a new node &quot;barney&quot; in &quot;fred&quot;.
              .h insert -at $id end &quot;barney&quot;

       A pathname describes the path to an entry in the hierarchy.  It&apos;s a  list
       of  entry  names  that  compose the path in the tree.  Therefore, you can
       also add &quot;barney&quot; to &quot;fred&quot; as follows.

              # Create a new sub-entry of &quot;fred&quot;
              .h insert end &quot;fred barney&quot;

       Every name in the list is ancestor  of  the  next.   All  ancestors  must
       already  exist.   That means that an entry &quot;fred&quot; is an ancestor of &quot;bar&#8208;
       ney&quot; and must already exist.  But you can use the -autocreate  configura&#8208;
       tion option to force the creation of ancestor nodes.

              # Force the creation of ancestors.
              .h configure -autocreate yes
              .h insert end &quot;fred barney wilma betty&quot;

       Sometimes  the  pathname  is  already  separated  by a character sequence
       rather than formed as a list.  A file name is a  good  example  of  this.
       You  can use the -separator option to specify a separator string to split
       the path into its components.  Each pathname  inserted  is  automatically
       split using the separator string as a separator.  Multiple separators are
       treated as one.

              .h configure -separator /
              .h insert end &quot;/usr/local/tcl/bin&quot;

       If the path is prefixed by extraneous characters, you  can  automatically
       trim  it off using the -trim option.  It removed the string from the path
       before it is parsed.

              .h configure -trim C:/windows -separator /
              .h insert end &quot;C:/window/system&quot;

       You can insert more than one entry at a time with the  insert  operation.
       This can be much faster than looping over a list of names.

              # The slow way
              foreach f [glob $dir/*] {
                  .h insert end $f
              }
              # The fast way
              eval .h insert end [glob $dir/*]

       In  this  case, the insert operation will return a list of ids of the new
       entries.

       You can delete entries with the delete operation.  It takes one  or  more
       tags of ids as its argument. It deletes the entry and all its children.

              .h delete $id

       Entries  have several configuration options.  They control the appearance
       of the entry&apos;s icon and label.  We have already seen  the  -label  option
       that  sets  the  entry&apos;s text label.   The entry configure operation lets
       you set or modify an entry&apos;s configuration options.

              .h entry configure $id -color red -font fixed

       You can hide an entry and its children using the -hide option.

              .h entry configure $id -hide yes

       More that one entry can be configured at once.  All entries specified are
       configured with the same options.

              .h entry configure $i1 $i2 $i3 $i4 -color brown

       An  icon  is displayed for each entry.  It&apos;s a Tk image drawn to the left
       of the label.  You can set the icon with the entry&apos;s -icons  option.   It
       takes a list of two image names: one to represent the open entry, another
       when it is closed.

              set im1 [image create photo -file openfolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              .h entry configure $id -icons &quot;$im1 $im2&quot;

       If -icons is set to the empty string, no icons are display.

       If an entry has children, a button is displayed to the left of the  icon.
       Clicking the mouse on this button opens or closes the sub-hierarchy.  The
       button is normally a + or - symbol, but can be configured in a variety of
       ways using the button configure operation.  For example, the + and - sym&#8208;
       bols can be replaced with Tk images.

              set im1 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file downarrow.gif]
              .h button configure $id -images &quot;$im1 $im2&quot; \
                  -openrelief raised -closerelief raised

       Entries can contain an arbitrary number of data fields.  Data fields  are
       name-value  pairs.   Both  the  value  and name are strings.  The entry&apos;s
       -data option lets you set data fields.

              .h entry configure $id -data {mode 0666 group users}

       The -data takes a list of name-value pairs.

       You can display these data fields as columns in the treeview widget.  You
       can create and configure columns with the column operation.  For example,
       to add a new column to the widget, use the column insert operation.   The
       last argument is the name of the data field that you want to display.

              .h column insert end &quot;mode&quot;

       The column title is displayed at the top of the column.  By default, it&apos;s
       is the field name.  You  can  override  this  using  the  column&apos;s  -text
       option.

              .h column insert end &quot;mode&quot; -text &quot;File Permissions&quot;

       Columns  have several configuration options.  The column configure opera&#8208;
       tion lets you query or modify column options.
&#12;              .h column configure &quot;mode&quot; -justify left

       The -justify option says how the data is justified within in the  column.
       The -hide option indicates whether the column is displayed.

              .h column configure &quot;mode&quot; -hide yes

       Entries  can  be selected by clicking on the mouse.  Selected entries are
       drawn using the colors specified by the  -selectforeground  and  -select&#8208;
       background configuration options.  The selection itself is managed by the
       selection operation.

              # Clear all selections
              .h selection clear 0 end
              # Select the root node
              .h selection set 0

       The curselection operation returns a list of  ids  of  all  the  selected
       entries.

              set ids [.h curselection]

       You can use the get operation to convert the ids to their pathnames.

              set names [eval .h get -full $ids]

       If  a  treeview  is  exporting  its selection (using the -exportselection
       option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the
       selection.   Treeview  selections are available as type STRING; the value
       of the selection will be the pathnames of the selected entries, separated
       by newlines.

       The  treeview  supports  two modes of selection: single and multiple.  In
       single select mode, only one entry can be selected at a time, while  mul&#8208;
       tiple select mode allows several entries to be selected.  The mode is set
       by the widget&apos;s -selectmode option.

              .h configure -selectmode &quot;multiple&quot;

       You can be notified when the list of selected entries changes.  The  wid&#8208;
       get&apos;s  -selectcommand  specifies  a Tcl procedure that is called whenever
       the selection changes.

              proc SelectNotify { widget } {
                 set ids [$widget curselection]
              }
              .h configure -selectcommand &quot;SelectNotify .h&quot;

       The widget supports the standard Tk scrolling  and  scanning  operations.
       The  treeview  can  be  both  horizontally and vertically. You can attach
       scrollbars to the treeview the same way as the listbox or canvas widgets.

              scrollbar .xbar -orient horizontal -command &quot;.h xview&quot;
              scrollbar .ybar -orient vertical -command &quot;.h yview&quot;
              .h configure -xscrollcommand &quot;.xbar set&quot; \
                  -yscrollcommand &quot;.ybar set&quot;

       There are three different modes of scrolling: listbox, canvas, and  hier&#8208;
       box.   In  listbox mode, the last entry can always be scrolled to the top
       of the widget.  In hierbox mode, the last entry is always  drawn  at  the
       bottom of the widget.  The scroll mode is set by the widget&apos;s -selectmode
       option.

              .h configure -scrollmode &quot;listbox&quot;

       Entries can be programmatically opened or closed using the open and close
       operations respectively.

              .h open $id
              .h close $id

       When  an  entry  is opened, a Tcl procedure can be automatically invoked.
       The -opencommand option specifies this  procedure.   This  procedure  can
       lazily insert entries as needed.

              proc AddEntries { dir } {
                 eval .h insert end [glob -nocomplain $dir/*]
              }
              .h configure -opencommand &quot;AddEntries %P&quot;

       Now  when an entry is opened, the procedure AddEntries is called and adds
       children to the entry.  Before the command is invoked, special  &quot;%&quot;  sub&#8208;
       stitutions  (like  bind)  are  performed.  Above, %P is translated to the
       pathname of the entry.

       The same feature exists when  an  entry  is  closed.   The  -closecommand
       option specifies the procedure.

              proc DeleteEntries { id } {
                 .h entry delete $id 0 end
              }
              .h configure -closecommand &quot;DeleteEntries %#&quot;

       When  an  entry  is  closed,  the  procedure  DeleteEntries is called and
       deletes the entry&apos;s children using the entry delete operation (%# is  the
       id of entry).
