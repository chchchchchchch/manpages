TRIAL(1)                                                                TRIAL(1)



NAME
       trial - run unit tests

SYNOPSIS
       trial [ options ] [ file | package | module | TestCase | testmethod ] ...

       trial --help | -h

DESCRIPTION
       trial  loads  and  executes a suite of unit tests, obtained from modules,
       packages and files listed on the command line.

       trial will take either filenames or fully qualified Python names as argu&#8208;
       ments.   Thus  `trial myproject/foo.py&apos;, `trial myproject.foo&apos; and `trial
       myproject.foo.SomeTestCase.test_method&apos; are  all  valid  ways  to  invoke
       trial.

       After  running  the  given test suite, the default test reporter prints a
       summary of the test run. This consists of the word &quot;PASSED&quot; (if all tests
       ran  as expected) or &quot;FAILED&quot; (if any test behaved unexpectedly) followed
       by a count of the different kinds of test results encountered. The possi&#8208;
       ble kinds of test results includes:

       successes
              Tests  that  passed  all  their  assertions  and completed without
              error.  These are marked &quot;PASSED&quot; in the normal test output.

       failures
              Tests that failed an assertion, called self.fail()  or  explicitly
              raised  self.failureException  for  some  reason. These are marked
              &quot;FAILED&quot; in the normal test output.

       errors Tests that raised an unexpected  exception  (including  Assertion&#8208;
              Error), tests that caused the tearDown() method to raise an excep&#8208;
              tion, tests that run for longer than the timeout  interval,  tests
              that  caused  something  to  call twisted.python.log.err() without
              subsequently calling self.flushLoggedErrors(),  tests  that  leave
              the  reactor in an unclean state, etc. These are marked &quot;ERROR&quot; in
              the normal test output.

              Note that because errors can  be  caused  after  the  actual  test
              method returns, it is possible for a single test to be reported as
              both an error and a failure, and hence the total  number  of  test
              results can be greater than the total number of tests executed.

       skips  Tests  that were skipped, usually because of missing dependencies.
              These are marked &quot;SKIPPED&quot; in the normal test output.

       expectedFailures
              Tests that failed, but were expected to fail, usually because  the
              test  is for a feature that hasn&apos;t been implemented yet. These are
              marked &quot;TODO&quot; in the normal test output.

       unexpectedSuccesses
              Tests that should have been listed under expectedFailures,  except
              that  for  some  reason the test succeeded. These are marked &quot;SUC&#8208;
              CESS!?!&quot; in the normal test output.

OPTIONS
       -b, --debug
              Run the tests in the Python debugger. Also does post-mortem debug&#8208;
              ging  on  exceptions. Will load `.pdbrc&apos; from current directory if
              it exists.

       -B, --debug-stacktraces
              Report Deferred creation and callback stack traces

       --coverage
              Generate coverage information in the  `coverage&apos;  subdirectory  of
              the  trial  temp  directory  (`_trial_temp&apos;  by default). For each
              Python module touched by the execution of the given tests, a  file
              will  be  created in the coverage directory named for the module&apos;s
              fully-qualified name  with  the  suffix  `.cover&apos;.   For  example,
              because  the  trial test runner is written in Python, the coverage
              directory   will   almost   always   contain    a    file    named
              `twisted.trial.runner.cover&apos;.

              Each  `.cover&apos;  file  contains  a copy of the Python source of the
              module in question, with a prefix at the beginning  of  each  line
              containing  coverage  information.   For  lines  that are not exe&#8208;
              cutable (blank lines, comments, etc.)  the prefix is  blank.   For
              executable  lines  that  were run in the course of the test suite,
              the prefix is a number indicating the number of  times  that  line
              was  executed.  The string `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&apos; prefixes executable lines that
              were not executed in the course of the test suite.

              Note that this functionality uses  Python&apos;s  sys.settrace()  func&#8208;
              tion,  so  tests that call sys.settrace() themselves are likely to
              break trial&apos;s coverage functionality.

       --disablegc
              Disable the garbage collector for the duration of the test run. As
              each  test is run, trial saves the TestResult objects, which means
              that Python&apos;s garbage collector has more  non-garbage  objects  to
              wade  through, making each garbage-collection run slightly slower.
              Disabling garbage collection entirely will make some  test  suites
              complete  faster  (contrast  --force-gc,  below),  at  the cost of
              increasing (possibly greatly) memory consumption. This option also
              makes  tests  slightly more deterministic, which might help debug&#8208;
              ging in extreme circumstances.

       -e, --rterrors
              Print tracebacks to standard output as soon as they occur

       --force-gc
              Run gc.collect() before and after each test case. This can be used
              to  isolate  errors  that  occur when objects get collected.  This
              option would be the default, except it makes tests run  about  ten
              times slower.

       -h, --help
              Print a usage message to standard output, then exit.

       --help-reporters
              Print  a  list  of  valid reporters to standard output, then exit.
              Reporters can be selected with  the  --reporter  option  described
              below.

       --help-reactors
              Print  a  list of possible reactors to standard output, then exit.
              Not all listed reactors are available on every platform.  Reactors
              can be selected with the --reactor option described below.

       -l, --logfile logfile
              Direct   the  log  to  a  different  file.  The  default  file  is
              `test.log&apos;.  logfile is relative to _trial_temp.

       -n, --dry-run
              Go through all the tests and make them pass without running.
&#12;       -N, --no-recurse
              By default, trial recurses through packages to find  every  module
              inside  every  subpackage.   Unless,  that  is,  you  specify this
              option.

       --nopm Don&apos;t automatically jump into debugger for post-mortem analysis of
              exceptions.  Only usable in conjunction with --debug.

       --profile
              Run tests under the Python profiler.

       -r, --reactor reactor
              Choose which reactor to use.  See --help-reactors for a list.

       --recursionlimit
              Set Python&apos;s recursion limit. See sys.setrecursionlimit()

       --reporter
              Select  the  reporter  to use for trial&apos;s output.  Use the --help-
              reporters option to see a list of valid reporters.

       --spew Print an insanely verbose log of everything that  happens.  Useful
              when debugging freezes or locks in complex code.

       --tbformat format
              Format   to   display   tracebacks  with.  Acceptable  values  are
              `default&apos;, `brief&apos; and `verbose&apos;. `brief&apos; produces tracebacks that
              play nicely with Emacs&apos; GUD.

       --temp-directory directory
              WARNING:  Do  not  use  this  options unless you know what you are
              doing.  By default, trial creates a directory  called  _trial_temp
              under  the  current  working directory.  When trial runs, it first
              deletes this directory, then creates it,  then  changes  into  the
              directory  to  run  the tests. The log file and any coverage files
              are stored here. Use this option if you wish to have trial run  in
              a  directory  other than _trial_temp. Be warned, trial will delete
              the directory before re-creating it.

       --testmodule filename
              Ask trial to look into filename and run any tests specified  using
              the Emacs-style buffer variable `test-case-name&apos;.

       --unclean-warnings
              As  of  Twisted  8.0, trial will report an error if the reactor is
              left unclean at the end of the test. This option  is  provided  to
              assist  in  migrating  from  Twisted 2.5 to Twisted 8.0 and later.
              Enabling this option will turn the errors into warnings.

       -u, --until-failure
              Keep looping the tests until one of them  raises  an  error  or  a
              failure.  This is particularly useful for reproducing intermittent
              failures.

       --version
              Prints the Twisted version number and exit.

       --without-module modulenames
              Simulate the lack of the specified comma-separated  list  of  mod&#8208;
              ules.  This  makes it look like the modules are not present in the
              system, causing tests to check the behavior  for  that  configura&#8208;
              tion.

       -z, --random [seed]
              Run the tests in random order using the specified seed.
