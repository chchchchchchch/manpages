DESCRIPTION
       trident  is an Xorg driver for Trident video cards.  The driver is accel&#8208;
       erated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths: 1,  4,
       8,  15, 16, and 24. Multi-head configurations are supported.  The XvImage
       extension is supported on TGUI96xx and greater cards.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The trident driver supports PCI,AGP and ISA video cards based on the fol&#8208;
       lowing Trident chips:

       Blade       Blade3D, CyberBlade series i1, i7 (DSTN), i1, i1 (DSTN), Ai1,
                   Ai1 (DSTN),  CyberBlade/e4,  CyberBladeXP,  CyberBladeAi1/XP,
                   BladeXP

       Image       3DImage975,   3DImage985,  Cyber9520,  Cyber9525,  Cyber9397,
                   Cyber9397DVD

       ProVidia    9682, 9685, Cyber9382, Cyber9385, Cyber9388

       TGUI        9440AGi, 9660, 9680

       ISA/VLBus   8900C, 8900D,  9000,  9200CXr,  Cyber9320,  9400CXi,  9440AGi
                   These cards have been ported but need further testing and may
                   not work.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option &quot;PciRetry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;CyberShadow&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              For  Cyber  chipsets  only, turn off shadow registers. If you only
              see a partial display - this may be the option for  you.  Default:
              on.

       Option &quot;CyberStretch&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              For  Cyber  chipsets only, turn on stretching. When the resolution
              is lower than the LCD&apos;s  screen,  this  option  will  stretch  the
              graphics mode to fill the entire LCD. Default: off.

              default the values are assigned based on the video card.  Default:
              0.

       Option &quot;XvRskew&quot; &quot;integer&quot;

              trol  is turned off.  Note: This is not supported on all chipsets.
              Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;  Choose  acceleration  architecture,
              either  &quot;XAA&quot; or &quot;EXA&quot;.  XAA is the old (but stable) XFree86 based
              acceleration architecture.  EXA is a newer and  simpler  accelera&#8208;
              tion  architecture  designed  to  better  accelerate  the X Render
