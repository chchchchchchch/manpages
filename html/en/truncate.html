NAME
       truncate - shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified size

SYNOPSIS
       truncate OPTION... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

       If  a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.  If
       a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the extended part (hole)  reads  as
       zero bytes.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -o, --io-blocks
              treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes

       -r, --reference=RFILE
              base size on RFILE

       -s, --size=SIZE
              set or adjust the file size by SIZE

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE  may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one of follow&#8208;
       ing: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G,  T,  P,
