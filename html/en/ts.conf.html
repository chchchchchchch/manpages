TS.CONF(5)                            tslib                           TS.CONF(5)



NAME
       ts.conf - Configuration file for tslib, controlling touch screens for
       embedded devices.

DESCRIPTION
       The idea of tslib is to have a core library that provides standardised
       services, and a set of plugins to manage the conversion and filtering as
       needed.

       The plugins for a particular touchscreen are loaded automatically by the
       library under the control of a static configuration file, /etc/ts.conf.
       /etc/ts.conf gives the library basic configuration information. Each line
       specifies one module, and the parameters for that module. The modules are
       loaded in order, with the first one processing the touchscreen data
       first. For example:

             module_raw input
             module variance delta=30
             module dejitter delta=100
             module linear


MODULE PARAMETERS
       variance
           Tries to do it&apos;s best in order to filter out random noise coming from
           touchscreen ADC&apos;s. This is achieved by limiting the sample movement
           speed to some value (e.g. the pen is not supposed to move quicker
           than some threshold).

           This is a &apos;greedy&apos; filter, e.g. it gives less samples on output than
           receives on input.

           &#183;   Parameters: delta.

               Set the squared distance in touchscreen units between previous
               and current pen position (e.g. (X2-X1)^2 + (Y2-Y1)^2). This
               defines the criteria for determining whenever two samples are
               &apos;near&apos; or &apos;far&apos; to each other.

               If the distance between previous and current sample is &apos;far&apos;, the
               sample is marked as &apos;potential noise&apos;. This doesn&apos;t mean yet that
               it will be discarded; if the next reading will be close to it,
               this will be considered just a regular &apos;quick motion&apos; event, and
               it will sneak to the next layer. Also, if the sample after the
               &apos;potential noise&apos; is &apos;far&apos; from both previously discussed
               samples, this is also considered a &apos;quick motion&apos; event and the
               sample sneaks into the output stream.

       dejitter
           Removes jitter on the X and Y co-ordinates. This is achieved by
           applying a weighted smoothing filter. The latest samples have most
           weight; earlier samples have less weight. This allows to achieve 1:1
           input-&gt;output rate.

           &#183;   Parameters: delta.

               Squared distance between two samples ((X2-X1)^2 + (Y2-Y1)^2) that
               defines the &apos;quick motion&apos; threshold. If the pen moves quick, it
               is not feasible to smooth pen motion, besides quick motion is not
               precise anyway; so if quick motion is detected the module just
               discards the backlog and simply copies input to output.
&#12;       linear
           Linear scaling module, primarily used for conversion of touch screen
           co-ordinates to screen co-ordinates.

           &#183;   Parameters: xyswap.

               Interchange the X and Y co-ordinates -- no longer used or needed
               if the new linear calibration utility ts_calibrate is used.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Latest versions of the Xorg tslib input driver use hal to configure the
       touchscreen within Xorg. Environment variables are only needed for the
       tslib commands.

       TSLIB_TSDEVICE
           If the default touchscreen device cannot be found, set the
           TSLIB_TSDEVICE environment variable to the touchscreen device to use.

           Default: /dev/input/event0

       TSLIB_CONSOLEDEVICE
           Tslib default console device.

           Default: /dev/tty

       TSLIB_CALIBFILE
           Stores calibration data obtained using ts_calibrate.

           Default: /etc/pointercal

       TSLIB_CONFFILE
           Set a different location for the ts.conf configuration file itself.

           Default; /etc/ts.conf.

       TSLIB_FBDEVICE
           Framebuffer device to use for the touchscreen support.

           Default: /dev/fb0.

       TSLIB_PLUGINDIR
           Plugin directory for tslib.

           Default: /usr/lib/$triplet/ts0/ where triplet is the MultiArch path,
           e.g. arm-linux-gnueabi.
