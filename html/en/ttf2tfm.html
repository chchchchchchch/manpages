DESCRIPTION
       This  program  extracts  the metric and kerning information of a TrueType
       font and converts it into metric files usable by TeX  (quite  similar  to
       afm2tfm which is part of the dvips package; please consult its info files
       for more details on the various parameters (especially encoding files).

       Since a TrueType font often contains more than 256 glyphs, some means are
       necessary  to map a subset of the TrueType glyphs onto a TeX font.  To do
       this, two mapping tables are needed: the first (called `input&apos;  or  `raw&apos;
       encoding) maps the TrueType font to a raw TeX font (this mapping table is
       used by both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk), and  the  second  (called  `output&apos;  or
       `virtual&apos;  encoding) maps the raw TeX font to another (virtual) TeX font,
       providing all kerning and ligature information needed by TeX.

       This two stage mapping has the advantage that one raw  font  can  be  ac&#8208;
       cessed  with  various  LaTeX  encodings (e.g. T1 and OT1) via the virtual
       font mechanism, and just one PK file is necessary.

       For CJKV  (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old  Vietnamese)  fonts,  a  different
       mechanism is provided (see SUBFONT DEFINITION FILES below).

PARAMETERS
       Most of the command line switch names are the same as in afm2tfm for con&#8208;
       venience.  One or more space characters between an option and  its  value
       is mandatory; options can&apos;t be concatenated.  For historical reasons, the
       first parameter can not be a switch but must be the font name.

       -c caps-height-factor
              The height of small caps made with the -V switch.   Default  value
              of this real number is 0.8 times the height of uppercase glyphs.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -e extension-factor
              The  extension factor to stretch the characters horizontally.  De&#8208;
              fault value of this real number is 1.0; if less than 1.0, you  get
              a condensed font.

       -E encoding-id
              The  TrueType encoding ID.  Default value of this non-negative in&#8208;
              teger is 1.

              Will be ignored if -N is used.

       -f font-index
              The font index in a TrueType Collection.   Default  is  the  first
              font  (index 0).   [TrueType collections are usually found in some
              CJK fonts; e.g. the first font index specifies glyphs and  metrics
              for  horizontal  writing,  and the second font index does the same
              for vertical writing.  TrueType collections usually have  the  ex&#8208;
              tension `.ttc&apos;.]

              Will be ignored for ordinary TrueType fonts.

       -l     Create ligatures in subfonts between first and second bytes of all
              the original character  codes.   Example:   Character  code 0xABCD
              maps  to character position 123 in subfont 45.  Then a ligature in
              subfont 45 between position  0xAB  and 0xCD  pointing  to  charac&#8208;
              ter 123  will be produced.  The fonts of the Korean HLaTeX package
              use this feature.  Note that this option generates  correct  liga&#8208;
              tures only for TrueType fonts where the input cmap is identical to
              the output encoding.  In case of HLaTeX, TTFs must  have  platform
              ID 3 and encoding ID 5.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -L ligature-file
              Same  as  -l,  but  character codes for ligatures are specified in
              ligature-file.  For example, `-L KS-HLaTeX&apos; generates correct lig&#8208;
              atures  for  the  Korean HLaTeX package regardless of the platform
              and encoding ID of the used TrueType font (the file  KS-HLaTeX.sfd
              is part of the ttf2pk package).

              Ligature  files  have  the same format and extension as SFD files.
              This option will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -n     Use PS names (of glyphs) of the TrueType font.  Only glyphs with a
              valid entry in the selected cmap are used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -N     Use only PS names of the TrueType font.  No cmap is used, thus the
              switches -E and -P have no effect, causing a warning message.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -O     Use octal values for all character codes in the  VPL  file  rather
              than names; this is useful for symbol or CJK fonts where character
              names such as `A&apos; are meaningless.

       -p inencfile
              The input encoding file name for the  TTF&#8594;raw TeX  mapping.   This
              parameter has to be specified in a map file (default: ttfonts.map)
              recorded in ttf2pk.cfg for successive ttf2pk calls.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -P platform-id
              The TrueType platform ID.  Default value of this non-negative  in&#8208;
              teger is 3.

              Will be ignored if -N is used.

       -q     Make ttf2tfm quiet.  It suppresses any informational output except
              warning and error messages.  For CJK fonts,  the  output  can  get
              quite large if you don&apos;t specify this switch.

       -r old-glyphname new-glyphname
              Replaces  old-glyphname with new-glyphname.  This switch is useful
              if you want to give an unnamed glyph (i.e., a glyph which  can  be
              represented with `.gXXX&apos; or `.cXXX&apos; only) a name or if you want to
              rename an already existing glyph name.  You can&apos;t use the  `.gXXX&apos;
              or  `.cXXX&apos;  glyph name constructs for new-glyphname; multiple oc&#8208;
              currences of -r are possible.
&#12;              If in subfont mode or if  no  encoding  file  is  specified,  this
              switch is ignored.

       -R replacement-file
              Use  this  switch  if you have many replacement pairs; they can be
              collected in a file which should have `.rpl&apos;  as  extension.   The
              syntax  used  in  such replacement files is simple: Each non-empty
              line must contain a pair `old-glyphname  new-glyphname&apos;  separated
              by  whitespace  (without  the  quotation  marks).   A percent sign
              starts a line comment; you can continue a line on  the  next  line
              with a backslash as the last character.

              If  in  subfont  mode  or  if  no encoding file is specified, this
              switch is ignored.

       -s slant-factor
              The obliqueness factor to slant the  font,  usually  much  smaller
              than 1.  Default of this real number is 0.0; if the value is larg&#8208;
              er than zero, the characters slope to the right, otherwise to  the
              left.

       -t outencfile
              The output encoding file name for the virtual font(s).  Only char&#8208;
              acters in the raw TeX font are used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -T inoutencfile
              This is equivalent to `-p inoutencfile -t inoutencfile&apos;.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -u     Use only those characters specified in the output encoding, and no
              others.   By  default,  ttf2tfm tries to include all characters in
              the virtual font, even those not present in the encoding  for  the
              virtual font (it puts them into otherwise-unused positions, rather
              arbitrarily).

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -v vplfile
              Output a VPL file in addition to the TFM file.  If no  output  en&#8208;
              coding  file  is  specified,  ttf2tfm uses a default font encoding
              (cmtt10).  Note: Be careful to use different names for the virtual
              font and the raw font!

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -V scvplfile
              Same  as -v, but the virtual font generated is a pseudo small caps
              font obtained by scaling uppercase letters by 0.8 (resp. the value
              specified  with  -c)  to typeset lowercase.  This font handles ac&#8208;
              cented letters and retains proper kerning.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -w     Generate PostScript encoding  vectors  containing  glyph  indices,
              primarily  used  to embed TrueType fonts in pdfTeX.  ttf2tfm takes
              the TFM names and replaces the suffix  with  .enc;  that  is,  for
              files    foo01.tfm,    foo02.tfm, ...    it   creates   foo01.enc,
              foo02.enc, ... at the same place.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -x     Rotate all glyphs by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  If no  -y  pa&#8208;
              rameter  is  given, the rotated glyphs are shifted down vertically
              by 0.25em.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -y vertical-shift-factor
              Shift down rotated glyphs by the given amount (the unit is em).

              Ignored if not in subfont mode or glyphs are not rotated.

       --version
              Shows the current version of ttf2tfm and the used file search  li&#8208;
              brary (e.g.  kpathsea).

       --help Shows usage information.

       If no TFM file name is given, the name of the TTF file is used, including
       the full path and replacing the extension with `.tfm&apos;.

CMAPS
       Contrary to Type 1 PostScript fonts (but similar to  the  new  CID  Post&#8208;
       Script  font  format), most TrueType fonts have more than one native map&#8208;
       ping table, also called `cmap&apos;, which maps the (internal) TTF  glyph  in&#8208;
       dices  to the (external) TTF character codes.  Common examples are a map&#8208;
       ping table to Unicode encoded character positions, and the standard  Mac&#8208;
       intosh mapping.

       To  specify a TrueType mapping table, use the options -P and -E.  With -P
       you specify the platform ID; defined values are:

           platform              platform ID (pid)

           Apple Unicode                0
           Macintosh                    1
           ISO                          2
           Microsoft                    3

       The encoding ID depends on the platform.  For pid=0, we ignore the -E pa&#8208;
       rameter  (setting  it  to zero) since the mapping table is always Unicode
       version 2.0.  For pid=1, the following table lists the defined values:

         platform ID = 1

           script                encoding ID (eid)

           ISO 8859-1                   2

       And finally, the Microsoft encoding IDs:

         platform ID = 3

           encoding              encoding ID (eid)

           Symbol                       0

       The program will abort if you specify  an  invalid  platform/encoding  ID
       pair.   It  will  then show the possible pid/eid pairs.  Please note that
       most fonts have at most two or three cmaps, usually corresponding to  the
       pid/eid pairs (1,0), (3,0), or (3,1) in case of Latin based fonts.  Valid
       Microsoft fonts should have a (3,1) mapping table, but some  fonts  exist
       (mostly Asian fonts) which have a (3,1) cmap not encoded in Unicode.  The
       reason for this strange behavior is the fact  that  some  old  MS Windows
       versions will reject fonts having a non-(3,1) cmap (since all non-Unicode
       Microsoft encoding IDs are for Asian MS Windows versions).

       The -P and -E options of ttf2tfm must be equally  specified  for  ttf2pk;
       the  corresponding  parameters in a map file are `Pid&apos; and `Eid&apos;, respec&#8208;
       tively.

       The default pid/eid pair is (3,1).

       Similarly, an -f option must be specified as `Fontindex&apos; parameter  in  a
       map file.

       If  you  use  the  -N switch, all cmaps are ignored, using only the Post&#8208;
       Script names in the TrueType font.  The corresponding  option  in  a  map
       file  is  `PS=Only&apos;.   If  you use the -n switch, the default glyph names
       built into ttf2tfm are replaced with the PS  glyph  names  found  in  the
       font.  In many cases this is not what you want because the glyph names in
       the font are often incorrect or non-standard.  The  corresponding  option
       in a map file is `PS=Yes&apos;.

       Single  replacement  glyph names specified with -r must be given directly
       as `old-glyphname new-glyphname&apos; in a map file; -R is equivalent  to  the
       `Replacement&apos; option.

INPUT AND OUTPUT ENCODINGS
       You  must  specify the encoding vectors from the TrueType font to the raw
       TeX font and from the raw TeX font to the virtual  TeX  font  exactly  as
       with  afm2tfm,  but  you have more possibilities to address the character
       codes.  [With `encoding vector&apos; a mapping table with 256 entries in  form
       of a PostScript vector is meant; see the file T1-WGL4.enc of this package
       for an example.]  With afm2tfm, you must access each glyph with its Adobe
       glyph  name,  e.g. `/quotedsingle&apos;  or `/Acircumflex&apos;.  This has been ex&#8208;
       tended with ttf2tfm; now you can (and sometimes  must)  access  the  code
       points  and/or glyphs directly, using the following syntax for specifying
       the character  position  in  decimal,  octal,  or  hexadecimal  notation:
       `/.c&lt;decimal-number&gt;&apos;,  `/.c0&lt;octal-number&gt;&apos;,  or `/.c0x&lt;hexadecimal-num&#8208;
       ber&gt;&apos;.  Examples: `/.c72&apos;, `/.c0646&apos;, `/.c0x48&apos;.  To access a glyph index
       directly, use the character `g&apos; instead of `c&apos; in the just introduced no&#8208;
       tation.  Example: `/.g0x32&apos;.  [Note: The `.cXXX&apos; notation makes no  sense
       if -N is used.]

       For  pid/eid  pairs  (1,0)  and  (3,1), both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk recognize
       built-in default Adobe glyph names; the former follows the names given in
       Appendix E  of the book `Inside Macintosh&apos;, volume 6, the latter uses the
       names given in the TrueType Specification (WGL4, a Unicode subset).  Note
       that  Adobe names for a given glyph are often not unique and do sometimes
       differ, e.g., many PS fonts have the glyph `mu&apos;, whereas  this  glyph  is
       called  `mu1&apos;  in  the WGL4 character set to distinguish it from the real
       Greek letter mu.  Be also aware that OpenType (i.e.  TrueType 2.0)  fonts
       use  an  updated  WGL4  table;  we use the data from the latest published
       TrueType specification (1.66).  You can find those mapping tables in  the
       source code file ttfenc.c.

       On  the  other hand, the switches -n and -N makes ttf2tfm read in and use
       the PostScript names in the TrueType font itself (stored  in  the  `post&apos;
       table) instead of the default Adobe glyph names.

       Use  the  -r  switch to remap single glyph names and -R to specify a file
       containing replacement glyph name pairs.

       If you don&apos;t select an input encoding, the first 256 glyphs of the  True&#8208;
       Type  font  with a valid entry in the selected cmap will be mapped to the
       TeX raw font (without the -q option, ttf2tfm prints this mapping table to
       standard output), followed by all glyphs not yet addressed in the select&#8208;
       ed cmap.  However, some code points for the (1,0) pid/eid pair are  omit&#8208;
       ted  since they do not represent glyphs useful for TeX: 0x00 (null), 0x08
       (backspace), 0x09 (horizontal tabulation), 0x0d  (carriage  return),  and
       0x1d  (group separator).  The `invalid character&apos; with glyph index 0 will
       be omitted too.

       If you select the -N switch, the first 256 glyphs of  the  TrueType  font
       with  a  valid  PostScript name will be used in case no input encoding is
       specified.  Again, some glyphs  are  omitted:   `.notdef&apos;,  `.null&apos;,  and
       `nonmarkingreturn&apos;.

       If  you  don&apos;t  select an  output encoding, ttf2tfm uses the same mapping
       table as afm2tfm would use (you can find  it  in  the  source  code  file
       texenc.c);  it corresponds to TeX typewriter text.  Unused positions (ei&#8208;
       ther caused by empty code points in the mapping table or  missing  glyphs
       in the TrueType font) will be filled (rather arbitrarily) with characters
       present in the input encoding but not specified in  the  output  encoding
       (without  the -q option ttf2tfm prints the final output encoding to stan&#8208;
       dard output).  Use the -u option if you want only glyphs in  the  virtual
       font which are defined in the output encoding file, and nothing more.

       One  feature missing in afm2tfm has been added which is needed by LaTeX&apos;s
       T1 encoding: ttf2tfm will construct the  glyph  `Germandbls&apos;  (by  simply
       concatenating  two `S&apos; glyphs) even for normal fonts if possible.  It ap&#8208;
       pears in the glyph list as the last item, marked with an asterisk.  Since
       this isn&apos;t a real glyph it will be available only in the virtual font.

       For both input and output encoding, an empty code position is represented
       by the glyph name `/.notdef&apos;.

       In encoding files, you can use `\&apos; as the final character of  a  line  to
       indicate that the input is continued on the next line.  The backslash and
       the following newline character will be removed.

SUBFONT DEFINITION FILES
       CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts usually contain  sev&#8208;
       eral  thousand glyphs; to use them with TeX it is necessary to split such
       large fonts into subfonts.  Subfont definition files (usually having  the
       extension `.sfd&apos;) are a simple means to do this smoothly.

       A  subfont file name usually consists of a prefix, a subfont infix, and a
       postfix (which is empty in most cases), e.g.

         ntukai23 &#8594; prefix: ntukai, infix: 23, postfix: (empty)

       Here the syntax of a line in an SFD file, describing one subfont:

       &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;infix&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;ranges&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt;


       &lt;infix&gt; :=
              anything except whitespace.  It is best to use only alphanumerical
              characters.

       &lt;whitespace&gt; :=
              space,  formfeed, carriage return, horizontal and vertical tabs --
              no newline characters.

       &lt;ranges&gt; :=
              &lt;ranges&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;codepoint&gt; |
              &lt;ranges&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;range&gt; |
              &lt;ranges&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;offset&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;range&gt;

       &lt;codepoint&gt; :=
              &lt;number&gt;

       &lt;range&gt; :=
              &lt;number&gt; `_&apos; &lt;number&gt;

       &lt;offset&gt; :=
              &lt;number&gt; `:&apos;

       &lt;number&gt; :=
              hexadecimal (prefix `0x&apos;), decimal, or octal (prefix `0&apos;)

       A line can be continued on the next line  with  a  backslash  ending  the
       line.   The  ranges  must  not  overlap;  offsets have to be in the range
       0-255.

       Example:

         The line

           03   10: 0x2349 0x2345_0x2347

         assigns to the code positions 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the subfont  having
         the  infix  `03&apos; the character codes 0x2349, 0x2345, 0x2346, and 0x2347
         respectively.

       The SFD files in the distribution are customized for the CJK package  for
       LaTeX.

       You  have to embed the SFD file name into the TFM font name (at the place
       where the infix will appear) surrounded by two `@&apos; signs, on the  command
       line  resp. a  map  file;  both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk switch then to subfont
       mode.

       It is possible to use more than a single SFD file by separating them with
       commata and no whitespace; for a given subfont, the first file is scanned
       for an entry, then the next file, and so on.  Later entries override  en&#8208;
       tries  found  earlier  (possibly only partially).  For example, the first
       SFD file sets up range 0x10-0xA0, and the next one modifies entries  0x12
       and  0x25.   As  can be easily seen, this algorithm allows for adding and
       replacing, but not for removing entries.

       Subfont mode disables the options -n, -N, -p, -r, -R, -t, -T, -u, -v,  -V
       and  -w  for ttf2tfm; similarly, no `Encoding&apos; or `Replacement&apos; parameter
       is allowed in a map file.  Single replacement  glyph  names  are  ignored
       too.

       ttf2tfm  will  create  all  subfont  TFM files specified in the SFD files
       (provided the subfont contains glyphs) in one run.

       Example:

         The call

           ttf2tfm ntukai.ttf ntukai@Big5,Big5-supp@

         will use  Big5.sfd  and  Big5-supp.sfd,  producing  all  subfont  files
         ntukai01.tfm, ntukai02.tfm, etc.

RETURN VALUE
       ttf2tfm  returns  0 on success and 1 on error; warning and error messages
       are written to standard error.

SOME NOTES ON FILE SEARCHING
       Both ttf2pk and ttf2tfm use either the kpathsea, emtexdir, or MiKTeX  li&#8208;
       brary  for  searching files (emtexdir will work only on operating systems
       which have an MS-DOSish background, i.e.  MS-DOS, OS/2,  Windows;  MikTeX
       is specific to MS Windows).

       As a last resort, both programs can be compiled without a search library;
       the searched files must be then in the  current  directory  or  specified
       with  a  path.  Default extensions will be appended also (with the excep&#8208;
       tion that only `.ttf&apos; is appended and not `.ttc&apos;).

   kpathsea
       Please note that older versions of kpathsea (&lt;3.2) have no special  means
       to  seach for TrueType fonts and related files, thus we use the paths for
       PostScript related stuff.  The actual version of kpathsea is displayed on
       screen  if  you  call either ttf2pk or ttf2tfm with the --version command
       line switch.

       Here is a table of the file type and  the  corresponding  kpathsea  vari&#8208;
       ables.   TTF2PKINPUTS  and TTF2TFMINPUTS are program specific environment
       variables introduced in kpathsea version 3.2:

           .ttf and .ttc       TTFONTS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TTF2PKINPUTS
           .map                TTF2PKINPUTS
           .enc                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
           .rpl                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
           .tfm                TFMFONTS
           .sfd                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
&#12;       And here the same for pre-3.2-versions of kpathsea:

           .ttf and .ttc       T1FONTS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TEXCONFIG
           .map                TEXCONFIG
           .enc                TEXPSHEADERS
           .rpl                TEXPSHEADERS
           .tfm                TFMFONTS
           .sfd                TEXPSHEADERS

       Finally, the same for pre-3.0-versions (as used e.g. in teTeX 0.4):

           .ttf and .ttc       DVIPSHEADERS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TEXCONFIG
           .map                TEXCONFIG
           .enc                DVIPSHEADERS
           .rpl                DVIPSHEADERS
           .tfm                TFMFONTS
           .sfd                DVIPSHEADERS

       Please consult the info files of kpathsea for details on these variables.
       The decision whether to use the old or the new scheme will be done during
       compilation.

       You should  set  the  TEXMFCNF  variable  to  the  directory  where  your
       texmf.cnf configuration file resides.

       Here is the proper command to find out to which value a kpathsea variable
       is set (we use TTFONTS as an example).  This is especially  useful  if  a
       variable  isn&apos;t  set in texmf.cnf or in the environment, thus pointing to
       the default value which is hard-coded into the kpathsea library.

         kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -expand-var=&apos;$TTFONTS&apos;

       We select the program name also since it is possible to specify variables
       which  are searched only for a certain program -- in our example it would
       be TTFONTS.ttf2tfm.

       A similar but not identical method is to say

         kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -show-path=&apos;truetype fonts&apos;

       [A full list of format types can be obtained by saying `kpsewhich --help&apos;
       on  the  command  line prompt.]  This is exactly how ttf2tfm (and ttf2pk)
       searches for files; the disadvantage is that all variables  are  expanded
       which can cause very long strings.

   emtexdir
       Here  the  list of suffixes and their related environment variables to be
       set in autoexec.bat (resp. in config.sys for OS/2):

           .ttf and .ttc       TTFONTS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TTFCFG
           .map                TTFCFG
           .enc                TTFCFG
           .rpl                TTFCFG
           .tfm                TEXTFM
           .sfd                TTFCFG

       If one of the variables isn&apos;t set, a warning  message  is  emitted.   The
       current  directory  will  always  be searched.  As usual, one exclamation
       mark appended to a directory path causes subdirectories one level deep to
       be  searched,  two  exclamation  marks  cause  all  subdirectories  to be
       searched.  Example:

         TTFONTS=c:\fonts\truetype!!;d:\myfonts\truetype!

       Constructions like `c:\fonts!!\truetype&apos; aren&apos;t possible.

   MiKTeX
       Both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk have been fully integrated into  MiKTeX.   Please
       refer to the documentation of MiKTeX for more details on file searching.

PROBLEMS
       Many  vptovf implementations allow only 100 bytes for the TFM header (the
       limit is 1024 in the TFM file format itself): 8 bytes  for  checksum  and
       design size, 40 bytes for the family name, 20 bytes for the encoding, and
       4 bytes for a face byte.  There remain only 28 bytes for some  additional
       information  which is used by ttf2tfm for an identification string (which
       is essentially a copy of the command line), and this limit is always  ex&#8208;
       ceeded.

       The  optimal solution is to increase the value of max_header_bytes in the
       file vptovf.web (and probably pltotf.web too) to, say, 400 and  recompile
       vptovf (and pltotf).  Otherwise you&apos;ll get some (harmless) error messages
       like

         This HEADER index is too big for my present table size

       which can be safely ignored.
