TTYSLOT(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 TTYSLOT(3)



NAME
       ttyslot - find the slot of the current user&apos;s terminal in some file

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;    /* on BSD-like systems, and Linux */
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;    /* on System V-like systems */

       int ttyslot(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ttyslot():
           _BSD_SOURCE ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_ &lt; 500 &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The  legacy  function  ttyslot()  returns the index of the current user&apos;s
       entry in some file.

       Now &quot;What file?&quot; you ask.  Well, let&apos;s first look at some history.

   Ancient History
       There used to be a file /etc/ttys in  UNIX  V6,  that  was  read  by  the
       init(8)  program  to  find  out what to do with each terminal line.  Each
       line consisted of three characters.  The first character was  either  &apos;0&apos;
       or  &apos;1&apos;, where &apos;0&apos; meant &quot;ignore&quot;.  The second character denoted the ter&#8208;
       minal: &apos;8&apos; stood for &quot;/dev/tty8&quot;.  The third character was an argument to
       getty(8)  indicating  the  sequence of line speeds to try (&apos;-&apos; was: start
       trying 110 baud).  Thus a typical line was &quot;18-&quot;.  A hang  on  some  line
       was  solved  by  changing the &apos;1&apos; to a &apos;0&apos;, signaling init, changing back
       again, and signaling init again.

       In UNIX V7 the format was changed: here  the  second  character  was  the
       argument  to  getty(8) indicating the sequence of line speeds to try (&apos;0&apos;
       was: cycle through 300-1200-150-110 baud; &apos;4&apos; was for the on-line console
       DECwriter)  while  the  rest  of  the line contained the name of the tty.
       Thus a typical line was &quot;14console&quot;.

       Later systems have more elaborate syntax.   System  V-like  systems  have
       /etc/inittab instead.

   Ancient History (2)
       On  the  other  hand, there is the file /etc/utmp listing the people cur&#8208;
       rently logged in.  It is maintained by login(1).  It has  a  fixed  size,
       and  the  appropriate  index in the file was determined by login(1) using
       the ttyslot() call to find the number of the line in /etc/ttys  (counting
       from 1).

   The semantics of ttyslot
       Thus,  the function ttyslot() returns the index of the controlling termi&#8208;
       nal of the calling process in the file /etc/ttys, and that  is  (usually)
       the  same  as  the  index  of  the entry for the current user in the file
       /etc/utmp.  BSD still has the /etc/ttys file, but System  V-like  systems
       do not, and hence cannot refer to it.  Thus, on such systems the documen&#8208;
       tation says that ttyslot() returns the current user&apos;s index in  the  user
       accounting data base.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, this function returns the slot number.  On error (e.g., if
       none of the file descriptors 0, 1 or 2 is associated with a terminal that
       occurs  in  this  data  base) it returns 0 on UNIX V6 and V7 and BSD-like
       systems, but -1 on System V-like systems.

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv1; marked  as  LEGACY  in  SUSv2;  removed  in  POSIX.1-2001.   SUSv2
       requires -1 on error.

NOTES
       The  utmp  file  is  found  various  places  on  various systems, such as
       /etc/utmp, /var/adm/utmp, /var/run/utmp.

       The glibc2 implementation of this function  reads  the  file  _PATH_TTYS,
       defined  in  &lt;ttyent.h&gt;  as  &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;.   It returns 0 on error.  Since
       Linux systems do not usually have &quot;/etc/ttys&quot;, it will always return 0.

       Minix also has fttyslot(fd).
