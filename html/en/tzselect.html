TZSELECT(1)               Debian Timezone Configuration              TZSELECT(1)



NAME
       tzselect - view timezones

SYNOPSIS
       tzselect

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  explains how you can use the tzselect utility to view
       the installed timezone. It comes handy when you want to know what time it
       is in other countries, or if you just wonder what timezones exist.

       tzselect is called without any parameters from the shell. It shows a list
       of about one dozen geographic areas one can roughly recognize  as  conti&#8208;
       nents.  After  choosing  a geographic area by number, a list of countries
       and cities in this area will be shown.

       You can press the Enter key to reprint the list. To  choose  a  timezone,
       just  press  the  number  left to it.  If your input is invalid, the list
       will be reprinted.

       You may press Ctrl-C to interrupt the script at any time.

       Note that tzselect will not actually change the  timezone  for  you.  Use
       &apos;dpkg-reconfigure tzdata&apos; to achieve this.
