NAME
       uae - The Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator


SYNOPSIS
       uae [ -h ] [ -f file ] { -s opt=val }


PRELIMINARIES
       This  manual  page  was produced for uae 0.8.12.  It is only provided for
       convenience by the maintainer of the Debian package of  uae.  Please  see
       /usr/share/doc/uae for a thorough description. The following chapters are
       simply snippets from the upstream README.

       Btw, in my experience, the &quot;-h&quot; switch for some reasons does not work for
       uae 0.8.x.


OVERVIEW
       An  emulator is a program which enables you to run software for a machine
       which has non-native hardware and a non-native operating system, on  your
       computer.  UAE allows you to run most of the available Amiga software. It
       is a software emulation, meaning that no extra  or  special  hardware  is
       needed  to  do  this. The hardware of an Amiga is emulated accurately, so
       that Amiga software is tricked into thinking it is running  on  the  real
       thing,  with your computer&apos;s display, keyboard, harddisk and mouse taking
       the parts of their emulated counterparts.

       UAE was developed for Unixoid systems. Meanwhile, it has been  ported  to
       the  Mac,  DOS,  the BeBox, NextStep, the XFree86/OS2 environment and the
       Amigas (it can run itself by now). You should have received several other
       files along with this document with details on how to install and use the
       version for your operating system.

       This section is just what it says: an overview. Please read _all_ of this
       file,  especially  if  you have problems. UAE has many, many features and
       equally many configuration options. If you don&apos;t know  about  them,  it&apos;s
       likely  that  UAE  doesn&apos;t  work  for  you, or doesn&apos;t work as good as it
       could.

       Please read also the file &quot;FAQ&quot;  which  contains  some  Frequently  Asked
       Questions  (and  even  the  answers!) You should also look for a document
       describing the specific port of UAE  to  the  operating  system  you  are
       using, for example &quot;BeOS/README&quot; or &quot;DOS/README&quot;.

       People  have  complained  that the UAE documentation contains only &quot;weird
       jargon&quot;.  Sorry about this. Despite what MessySoft and Tomato  tell  you,
       computer programs aren&apos;t always easy to use. UAE does require some assis&#8208;
       tance from you, and therefore you should at least understand a bit  about
       computers.  After  all,  you  are an Amiga fan, so you should know what a
       Workbench is, don&apos;t you think?



INVOKING UAE
       First, read the system-specific documents for information how to  set  up
       UAE.   You should have an executable program called &quot;uae&quot;. You can simply
       execute it, but you can also optionally give it one or more of  the  fol&#8208;
       lowing parameters:

        -h              : Print out a help text.
        -f file         : Load a configuration file.
        -s opt=val      : Set the emulator&apos;s option &quot;opt&quot; to value &quot;val&quot;.

       Configuration  files consist of several lines of the form &quot;opt=val&quot;, just
       as with the &quot;-s&quot; parameter.  You can use the following options  with  the
       &quot;-s&quot;  option,  or in a config file.  [Here, &quot;=n&quot; means the option takes a
       number as value.  &quot;=bool&quot; means the option takes a value of either  &quot;yes&quot;
       or  &quot;no&quot;  (or  &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or abbreviations of any of these).  There
       are other classes as well.]

       General options:

       accuracy=n [default=2]

       Set emulator accuracy to n. The default is n = 2, which means the  emula&#8208;
       tor  will  try to be as accurate as possible. This no longer does much in
       this version, and I&apos;ll probably remove it.

       framerate=n [default=1]

       Sets the frame rate to 1/n. Only every nth screen will be drawn.  Using a
       higher  value can speed up the emulator, at the expense of graphics qual&#8208;
       ity.

       autoconfig=bool [default=yes]

       If this is enabled, all expansion devices provided by the emulation  will
       be  automounted. You should only disable this if you have a Kickstart ROM
       earlier than 1.3 which can&apos;t cope with this. Some badly written games and
       demos might also be incompatible with this.

       kbd_lang=lang [default=us]

       Set  the  keyboard language. Currently, the following values can be used:
       &quot;us&quot; for U.S. keyboard (default), &quot;se&quot; for swedish, &quot;fr&quot; for french, &quot;it&quot;
       for italian, &quot;es&quot; for spanish, or &quot;de&quot; for german keyboard.  This setting
       only affects the X11 version.

       floppy0=file [default=df0.adf]

       Try to use the specified file as diskfile for drive 0 instead of df0.adf.
       The options floppy1, floppy2, and floppy3 also exist.

       kickstart_rom_file=file [default=kick.rom]

       Use the specified file instead of kick.rom as Kickstart image.

       joyport0=mode [default=mouse]

       Specify  how  to emulate joystick port 0. You can use &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;joy0&quot;, or
       &quot;joy1&quot; to use the corresponding input devices of your machine, or you can
       select several different keyboard replacements for a joystick: &quot;kbd1&quot; for
       the numeric pad with &apos;0&apos; as fire button, &quot;kbd2&quot; for the cursor keys  with
       right control as fire button and c is T/F/H/B with Alt as fire button.

       joyport1=mode [default=joy0]

       Like joyport0, but for the Amiga&apos;s joystick port 1.

       use_gui=bool [default=yes]

       Show a user-interface that enables changing these options at run-time.

       32bit_blits=bool [default=no]

       If  enabled,  the blitter emulation will use 32 bit operations where that
       seems profitable (note that this will cause  bus  errors  on  most   RISC
       machines)

       immediate_blits=bool [default=no]

       If  enabled,  all  blits  will  finish immediately, which can be nice for
       speed, but may cause incompatibilities.

       cpu_speed=speed [default=4]

       This can have a value of &quot;real&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, or an integer between 1  and  20.
       &quot;real&quot;  will  try to give the CPU emulation exactly as many cycles, rela&#8208;
       tive to the other chips, as on a real A500.  &quot;max&quot; will try to  give  you
       the maximum CPU emulation speed achievable on your machine.  Numeric val&#8208;
       ues specify a fixed relation between CPU and custom chip emulation, where
       lower  values  prioritize  CPU  emulation, while higher values prioritize
       custom chip emulation.

       cpu_type=type [default=68000]

       Controls which CPU is emulated. This can be &quot;68000&quot;, &quot;68010&quot;, &quot;68020&quot;  or
       &quot;68020/68881&quot;.   In  some  cases,  you  may  need  to  use  &quot;68ec020&quot;  or
       &quot;68ec020/68881&quot; to emulate a crippled variant of the 68020 that has  only
       a  24 bit address bus.  Some software, including some Kickstart versions,
       does not work with a normal 68020 that has a 32 bit address  bus.   Care&#8208;
       ful:  using  an &quot;ec&quot; variant has harmful side effects, and should be dis&#8208;
       abled unless absolutely needed (you lose Z3  memory  and  Picasso  emula&#8208;
       tion).

       cpu_compatible=bool [default=no]

       If enabled, a slower but slightly more accurate variant of the CPU emula&#8208;
       tion will be used.  This is needed for some  types  of  copy  protection,
       among other things. This is only meaningful for a CPU type of &quot;68000&quot;.

       Emulating external devices (harddisk, CD-ROM, printer, serial port):

       filesystem=access,volume:path [default=no filesystems mounted]

       Mount the host&apos;s file system at &quot;path&quot; as an Amiga filesystem with volume
       name &quot;VOLUME:&quot;.  &quot;access&quot; can be either &quot;ro&quot; (for readonly), or &quot;rw&quot; (for
       read-write).   If  you  want to mount a CD-ROM, you should use a readonly
       mount.  You can mount multiple file systems.  See below.

       hardfile=access,secs,heads,reserved,bsize,file   [default=no    hardfiles
       mounted]

       Mount  the  hardfile  &quot;file&quot; as an emulated harddisk, using a geometry of
       &quot;secs&quot; sectors per track, &quot;heads&quot;  surfaces  and  &quot;nr&quot;  reserved  blocks.
       Each sector should have &quot;bsize&quot; bytes. This can be abused to mount floppy
       images.  You can mount multiple hardfiles.  See below.

       Sound options:

       sound_output=type [default=none]

       The type of sound output can be &quot;none&quot; (no sound  at  all),  &quot;interrupts&quot;
       (emulated  for the internal side effects that can be noticed by programs,
       but no sound output), &quot;normal&quot; (emulated, and sound output),  &quot;exact&quot;  (a
       slightly more accurate emulation that may be necessary in some cases, but
       can also be slower).

       sound_channels=type [default=mono]

       Can be &quot;mono&quot; or &quot;stereo&quot;.

       sound_bits=n [default varies across UAE versions on different OS types]

       Common values are 8 (low quality) or 16 (high quality)

       sound_frequency=n [default varies across UAE  versions  on  different  OS
       types]

       Common  values  are 22050 or 44100. The quality of sound output increases
       with the frequency.

       sound_min_buff=n

       sound_max_buff=n [default varies across  UAE  versions  on  different  OS
       types]

       You  can  specify  the  minimum  and  maximum  size  of the sound buffer.
       Smaller buffers reduce latency.  Usually only the minimum size is used.

       sound_interpol=type [default none]

       Normally, sound samples are output exactly as they are computed,  without
       any  post-processing.   This can generate errors in the sound output when
       the output frequency isn&apos;t an  even  multiple  of  the  input  frequency.
       These  errors are usuable perceived as a high-frequency noise.  There are
       currently two types of interpolation available, both  under  experimenta&#8208;
       tion.   You can use either &quot;rh&quot; or &quot;crux&quot; as value for this option.  Note
       that no interpolation is supported for 8 bit output; you need to  use  16
       bit  output  to  hear  a  difference.  If you have any comments about the
       effects of either method on audio quality, I&apos;d be very interested to hear
       them.

       Memory options:

       bogomem_size=n [default=0]

       Emulate n*256K slow memory at 0xC00000. Some demos/games need this.

       fastmem_size=n [default=0]

       Emulate n megabytes of fast memory as an expansion board.

       z3mem_size=n [default=0]

       Emulate n megabytes of Zorro III fast memory as an expansion board.

       chipmem_size=n [default=4]

       Emulate  n*512K  chip  memory.  Some  very  broken programs need specific
       amounts of chip mem to work properly. The  largest  valid  value  is  16,
       which means 8MB chip memory.

       Display options:

       gfx_width=n [default=800]

       Use a window that is n pixels wide for displaying the Amiga screen.

       gfx_height=n [default=300]

       Use a window that is n pixels high for displaying the Amiga screen.

       gfx_lores=bool [default=no]

       Enable  this option if you use a very small window width (320 to 400 pix&#8208;
       els) to shrink the display horizontally.

       gfx_linemode=type [default=none]

       The type can be none (every line is drawn once), &quot;double&quot; (every line  is
       drawn twice), and &quot;scanlines&quot; (every line is drawn once, but the image is
       stretched vertically by inserting a black line every other line to  simu&#8208;
       late  the  display  on  an  old  monitor).   The &quot;double&quot; mode gives best
       results, but slows down the emulation quite a lot. Don&apos;t use  the  &quot;none&quot;
       mode  if  you  want a decent interlace emulation.  If you use &quot;double&quot; or
       &quot;scanlines&quot;, your window needs to be twice as  high  as  when  using  the
       &quot;none&quot; mode.

       gfx_correct_aspect=bool [default=none]

       Try  to fit the image into the specified window dimensions by leaving out
       certain lines.  Useful if you want to fit a 640x512 Amiga  display  in  a
       640x480 window.

       gfx_center_vertical=bool [default=no]

       gfx_center_horizontal=bool [default=no]

       If you use a smaller window than 800x300 (400x300 with &quot;gfx_lores&quot; option
       or 800x600 with a gfx_linemode other than &quot;none&quot;), not all parts  of  the
       display  will  fit  on  the  screen.  By enabling the necessary centering
       options, you can ask the emulator to try and move the screen contents  so
       that the relevant parts are displayed. If you are unlucky, this can cause
       the contents to jump around a bit in certain cases.

       gfx_fullscreen_amiga=bool [default=no]

       Enable if you want to use the full screen, not a window on  the  desktop,
       for  the  Amiga display.  Some ports (DOS, SVGAlib) always use fullscreen
       mode.

       gfx_fullscreen_picasso=bool [default=no]

       Like gfx_fullscreen_amiga, but for the Picasso graphics card display.

       gfx_color_mode=mode [default=8bit]

       Select a color mode to use.  Color modes: 8bit (256 colors), 15bit (32768
       colors),  16bit (65536 colors), 8bit_dithered (256 colors, with dithering
       to improve quality), 4bit_dithered (16 colors, dithered); 32bit (16  mil&#8208;
       lion colors)

       gfxcard_size=n [default=0]

       Emulate  a Picasso 96 compatible graphics card with n MB graphics memory.
       This requires that you use set the CPU type to  &quot;68020&quot;  or  higher,  and
       that you do not use 24 bit addressing.

       Debugging options (not interesting for most users):

       use_debugger=bool [default=no]

       If enabled, don&apos;t start the emulator at once, use the built-in debugger.

       log_illegal_mem [default=no]

       If enabled, print illegal memory accesses
