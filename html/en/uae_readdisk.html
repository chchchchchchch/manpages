NAME
       uae_readdisk - Tool for reading *.adf (Amiga Disk Format) files


SYNOPSIS
       uae [ -h ] [ -f file ] { -s opt=val }


PRELIMINARIES
       This  manual  page  was produced for uae 0.8.12.  It is only provided for
       convenience by the maintainer of the Debian package of  uae.  Please  see
       /usr/share/doc/uae for a thorough description. The following chapters are
       simply snippets from the upstream README.


Retrieving files from a disk image
       If you have a disk image file, and you want to retrieve  the  files  from
       it, you can use the &quot;readdisk&quot; tool. It is automatically built by &quot;make&quot;.
       If you have a disk image of a disk called &quot;Workbench1.3D&quot; as df0.adf, and
       you do
          readdisk  df0.adf the whole directory structure of the disk image will
       be stored in a newly created subdirectory called &quot;Workbench1.3D&quot;. You can
       optionally give a second parameter to specify a directory where to create
       the output other than the current directory.  readdisk  only  understands
       about  the  OFS right now. FFS disks will cheerfully be regarded as being
       unreadable. Use the unixfs.device from within the emulator if you want to
       transfer files from FFS disks.
