UALARM(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  UALARM(3)



NAME
       ualarm - schedule signal after given number of microseconds

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       useconds_t ualarm(useconds_t usecs, useconds_t interval);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ualarm():
           Since glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
                       _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &amp;&amp;
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700)
           Before glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The ualarm() function causes the signal SIGALRM to be sent to the  invok&#8208;
       ing  process  after (not less than) usecs microseconds.  The delay may be
       lengthened slightly by any system activity or by the time spent  process&#8208;
       ing the call or by the granularity of system timers.

       Unless caught or ignored, the SIGALRM signal will terminate the process.

       If the interval argument is nonzero, further SIGALRM signals will be sent
       every interval microseconds after the first.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns the number of microseconds remaining for any  alarm
       that was previously set, or 0 if no alarm was pending.

ERRORS
       EINTR  Interrupted by a signal.

       EINVAL usecs  or interval is not smaller than 1000000.  (On systems where
              that is considered an error.)

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD,  POSIX.1-2001.   POSIX.1-2001   marks   ualarm()   as   obsolete.
       POSIX.1-2008  removes  the specification of ualarm().  4.3BSD, SUSv2, and
       POSIX do not define any errors.

NOTES
       The type useconds_t is an unsigned integer type capable of holding  inte&#8208;
       gers  in  the range [0,1000000].  On the original BSD implementation, and
       in glibc before version 2.1, the arguments to ualarm() were instead typed
       as  unsigned  int.   Programs will be more portable if they never mention
       useconds_t explicitly.

       The interaction of this function  with  other  timer  functions  such  as
       alarm(2),    sleep(3),   nanosleep(2),   setitimer(2),   timer_create(2),
       timer_delete(2), timer_getoverrun(2), timer_gettime(2), timer_settime(2),
       usleep(3) is unspecified.

       This  function  is  obsolete.   Use setitimer(2) or POSIX interval timers
       (timer_create(2), etc.)  instead.
