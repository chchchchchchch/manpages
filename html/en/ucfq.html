UCFQ(1)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               UCFQ(1)



NAME
       ucfq - query the ucf database

SYNOPSIS
        usage: ucfq [options] (/path/to/file|package)[/path/to/file|package  ...]

OPTIONS
       --help h Print out a usage message.
       --debug -d Turn on debugging mode.
       --verbose -v Make the script more verbose..
       --with-colons -w
            Normally, the script presents the information in a human readable
            tabular format, but that may be harder for a machine to parse. With
            this option, the output is a compact, colon separated line, with no
            dividers, headers, or footer.

       --state-dr dir
            Set the state directory to &quot;/path/to/dir&quot; instead of the default
            &quot;/var/lib/ucf&quot;.  Used mostly for testing.

DESCRIPTION
       This script takes a set of arguments, each of which is a package name
       (and thus does not contain a /) or a full path to a configuration file,
       and outputs the associated package, if any, if the file exists on disk,
       and whether it has been modified by the user.  The output is either a
       human readable tabular form, or a compact colon-separated machine
       friendly format.

       This script can potentially be used in package &quot;postrm&quot; scripts during
       purge to query the system for configuration files that may still exist on
       the system, and whether these files have been locally modified by the
       user -- assuming that the package registered all the configuration files
       with ucf using &quot;ucfr&quot;.

CAVEATS
       This is very inchoate, at the moment, and needs testing.

BUGS
       None Known so far.
