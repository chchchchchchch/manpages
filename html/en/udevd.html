UDEVD(8)                              udevd                             UDEVD(8)



NAME
       udevd - event managing daemon

SYNOPSIS
       udevd [--daemon] [--debug] [--children-max=] [--exec-delay=]
             [--resolve-names=early|late|never] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       udevd listens to kernel uevents. For every event, udevd executes matching
       instructions specified in udev rules. See udev(7).

       On startup the content of the directory /lib/udev/devices is copied to
       /dev. If kernel modules specify static device nodes, these nodes are
       created even without a corresponding kernel device, to allow on-demand
       loading of kernel modules. Matching permissions specified in udev rules
       are applied to these static device nodes.

       The behavior of the running daemon can be changed with udevadm control.

OPTIONS
       --daemon
           Detach and run in the background.

       --debug
           Print debug messages to stderr.

       --children-max=
           Limit the number of parallel executed events.

       --exec-delay=
           Number of seconds to delay the execution of RUN instructions. This
           might be useful when debugging system crashes during coldplug cause
           by loading non-working kernel modules.

       --resolve-names=
           Specify when udevd should resolve names of users and groups. When set
           to early (the default) names will be resolved when the rules are
           parsed. When set to late names will be resolved for every event. When
           set to never names will never be resolved and all devices will be
           owned by root.

       --version
           Print version number.

       --help
           Print help text.

ENVIRONMENT
       UDEV_LOG=
           Set the logging priority.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       udev.log-priority=
           Set the logging priority.

       udev.children-max=
           Limit the number of parallel executed events.

       udev.exec-delay=
           Number of seconds to delay the execution of RUN instructions. This
           might be useful when debugging system crashes during coldplug cause
           by loading non-working kernel modules.
