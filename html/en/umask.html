UMASK(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   UMASK(2)



NAME
       umask - set file mode creation mask

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       mode_t umask(mode_t mask);

DESCRIPTION
       umask()  sets  the  calling  process&apos;s file mode creation mask (umask) to
       mask &amp; 0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of mask are  used),  and
       returns the previous value of the mask.

       The  umask is used by open(2), mkdir(2), and other system calls that cre&#8208;
       ate files to modify the permissions placed  on  newly  created  files  or
       directories.   Specifically, permissions in the umask are turned off from
       the mode argument to open(2) and mkdir(2).

       The constants that should be used to specify  mask  are  described  under
       stat(2).

       The  typical  default  value  for  the process umask is S_IWGRP | S_IWOTH
       (octal 022).  In the usual case where the mode  argument  to  open(2)  is
       specified as:

           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH

       (octal  0666)  when creating a new file, the permissions on the resulting
       file will be:

           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH

       (because 0666 &amp; ~022 = 0644; i.e., rw-r--r--).

RETURN VALUE
       This system call always succeeds and the previous value of  the  mask  is
       returned.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       A  child  process  created  via fork(2) inherits its parent&apos;s umask.  The
       umask is left unchanged by execve(2).

       The umask setting also affects the  permissions  assigned  to  POSIX  IPC
       objects  (mq_open(3),  sem_open(3),  shm_open(3)), FIFOs (mkfifo(3)), and
       UNIX domain sockets (unix(7)) created by the process.  The umask does not
       affect  the  permissions  assigned to System V IPC objects created by the
       process (using msgget(2), semget(2), shmget(2)).

SEE ALSO
       chmod(2), mkdir(2), open(2), stat(2)
