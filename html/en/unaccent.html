unaccent(1)                                                          unaccent(1)



NAME
       unaccent - remove accents from input stream or a string


SYNOPSIS
       unaccent [--debug_low] [--debug_high] [-h] charset [string] [expected]

DESCRIPTION
       With a single argument, unaccent reads data from stdin, replaces accented
       letters by their unaccented equivalent and writes the result  on  stdout.
       If  the  second argument (&apos;string&apos;) is provided unaccent transforms it by
       replacing accented letters by their unaccented equivalent. The result  is
       printed  on  the standard output.  The charset of the input string or the
       data read from stdin is specified by the &apos;charset&apos; argument  (ISO-8859-15
       for instance). The output is printed using the same charset.

       If  the &apos;expected&apos; argument is provided, the output string is compared to
       it. If they are not equal unaccent exits on error.

       unaccent relies on the iconv(3) library to  convert  from  the  specified
       charset  to UTF-16BE (or UTF-16 if UTF-16BE is not available). You should
       check the manual pages for available charsets. On GNU/Linux the command

       iconv -l

       shows all available charsets.


OPTIONS
       --debug_low
              Prints  human  readable  information  about   the   unaccentuation
              process. See unac(3) for more information.


       --debug_high
              Prints very detailed information about the unaccentuation process.
              See unac(3) for more information.


       --help -h
              Prints a short usage and exits.


EXAMPLES
       Remove accents from the string &#233;t&#233; and check that the result is ete.

       unaccent ISO-8859-1 &#233;t&#233; ete


       Remove accents from file myfile and put the result in  file  myfile.unac&#8208;
       cent

       unaccent ISO-8859-1 &lt; myfile &gt; myfile.unaccent
