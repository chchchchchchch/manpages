UNFLATTEN(1)                                                        UNFLATTEN(1)



NAME
       unflatten - adjust directed graphs to improve layout aspect ratio

SYNOPSIS
       unflatten [-f] [-llen] [-clen ] [ -o outfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       unflatten  is  a  preprocessor  to dot that is used to improve the aspect
       ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected nodes.  The usual lay&#8208;
       out  for  such a graph is generally very wide or tall.  unflatten inserts
       invisible edges or adjusts the minlen on edges  to  improve  layout  com&#8208;
       paction.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -l len The minimum length of leaf edges is staggered between 1 and len (a
              small integer).

       -f     Enables the staggering of the -l  option  to  fanout  nodes  whose
              indegree and outdegree are both 1. This helps with structures such
              as a -&gt; {w x y z} -&gt; b.  This option only works if the -l flag  is
              set.

       -c len Form disconnected nodes into chains of up to len nodes.

       -o outfile
              causes the output to be written to the specified file; by default,
              output is written to stdout.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If  no
               files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.
