NAME
       unicode::data - unicode data tables, generated, internal

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.3

       package require unicode::data  1.0.0

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  unicode::data package is a helper for unicode, providing it with the
       data tables needed to perform its functions. It is  an  internal  package
       which  should  not be accessed on its own. Because of that it has no pub&#8208;
       licly documented API either. Its implementation is generated by a script.
