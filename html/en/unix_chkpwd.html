NAME
       unix_chkpwd - Helper binary that verifies the password of the current
       user

SYNOPSIS
       unix_chkpwd [...]

DESCRIPTION
       unix_chkpwd is a helper program for the pam_unix module that verifies the
       password of the current user. It also checks password and account
       expiration dates in shadow. It is not intended to be run directly from
       the command line and logs a security violation if done so.

       It is typically installed setuid root or setgid shadow.

       The interface of the helper - command line options, and input/output data
       format are internal to the pam_unix module and it should not be called
       directly from applications.
