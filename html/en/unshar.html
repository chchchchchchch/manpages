UNSHAR(1)                                                              UNSHAR(1)



NAME
       unshar - unpack a shar file

SYNOPSIS
       unshar [ options ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Unshar  scans mail messages looking for the start of a shell archive.  It
       then passes the archive through a copy of the shell  to  unpack  it.   It
       will  accept  multiple  files.   If no files are given, standard input is
       used.

OPTIONS
       Options have a one letter version starting  with  -  or  a  long  version
       starting  with --.  The exception is --help and --version, which does not
       have a short version.

       --version
              Print the version number of the program on standard  output,  then
              immediately exits.

       --help Print a help summary on standard output, then immediately exits.

       -d DIRECTORY  --directory=DIRECTORY
              Change directory to DIRECTORY before unpacking any files.

       -c  --overwrite
              Passed  as an option to the shar file.  Many shell archive scripts
              (including those produced by `shar&apos; 3.40 and newer) accepts  a  -c
              argument to indicate that existing files should be overwritten.

       -e  --exit-0
              This  option  exists  mainly for people who collect many shell ar&#8208;
              chives into a single mail folder.  With this option, `unshar&apos; iso&#8208;
              lates each different shell archive from the others which have been
              put in the same file, unpacking each in turn, from  the  beginning
              of  the  file towards its end.  Its proper operation relies on the
              fact that many shar files are terminated by  a  `exit  0&apos;  at  the
              beginning of a line.

              Option -e is internally equivalent to -E &quot;exit 0&quot;.

       -E STRING  --split-at=STRING
              This option works like -e, but it allows you to specify the string
              that separates archives if `exit 0&apos; isn&apos;t appropriate.

              For example, noticing that most `.signatures&apos; have  a  `--&apos;  on  a
              line  right before them, one can sometimes use `--split-at=--&apos; for
              splitting shell archives which lack the `exit 0&apos; line at end.  The
              signature  will then be skipped altogether with the headers of the
              following message.

       -f  --force
              The same as -c.
