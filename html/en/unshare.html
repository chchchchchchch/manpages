UNSHARE(2)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 UNSHARE(2)



NAME
       unshare - disassociate parts of the process execution context

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;

       int unshare(int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       unshare() allows a process to disassociate parts of its execution context
       that are currently being shared with other processes.  Part of the execu&#8208;
       tion  context,  such  as the mount namespace, is shared implicitly when a
       new process is created using fork(2) or vfork(2), while other parts, such
       as  virtual  memory,  may  be  shared by explicit request when creating a
       process using clone(2).

       The main use of unshare() is to allow a process  to  control  its  shared
       execution context without creating a new process.

       The flags argument is a bit mask that specifies which parts of the execu&#8208;
       tion context should be unshared.  This argument  is  specified  by  ORing
       together zero or more of the following constants:

       CLONE_FILES
              Reverse  the effect of the clone(2) CLONE_FILES flag.  Unshare the
              file descriptor table, so  that  the  calling  process  no  longer
              shares its file descriptors with any other process.

       CLONE_FS
              Reverse  the  effect  of the clone(2) CLONE_FS flag.  Unshare file
              system attributes, so that the calling process  no  longer  shares
              its  root  directory,  current directory, or umask attributes with
              any other process.  chroot(2), chdir(2), or umask(2)

       CLONE_NEWIPC (since Linux 2.6.19)
              This flag has the same effect as the clone(2)  CLONE_NEWIPC  flag.
              Unshare  the  System  V IPC namespace, so that the calling process
              has a private copy of the System V  IPC  namespace  which  is  not
              shared with any other process.  Specifying this flag automatically
              implies CLONE_SYSVSEM as well.  Use of CLONE_NEWIPC  requires  the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       CLONE_NEWNET (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This  flag  has the same effect as the clone(2) CLONE_NEWNET flag.
              Unshare the network namespace, so  that  the  calling  process  is
              moved  into  a  new network namespace which is not shared with any
              previously   existing   process.    CLONE_NEWNET   requires    the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       CLONE_NEWNS
              This  flag  has  the same effect as the clone(2) CLONE_NEWNS flag.
              Unshare the mount namespace, so that the  calling  process  has  a
              private  copy  of its namespace which is not shared with any other
              process.  Specifying this flag automatically implies  CLONE_FS  as
              well.  Use of CLONE_NEWNS requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       CLONE_SYSVSEM (since Linux 2.6.26)
              This  flag reverses the effect of the clone(2) CLONE_SYSVSEM flag.
              Unshare System V  semaphore  undo  values,  so  that  the  calling
              process  has  a  private  copy  which is not shared with any other
              process.  Use of CLONE_SYSVSEM requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabil&#8208;
              ity.

       CLONE_NEWUTS (since Linux 2.6.19)
              This  flag  has the same effect as the clone(2) CLONE_NEWUTS flag.
              Unshare the UTS IPC namespace, so that the calling process  has  a
              private  copy  of  the  UTS namespace which is not shared with any
              other process.  Use of  CLONE_NEWUTS  requires  the  CAP_SYS_ADMIN
              capability.

       If  flags is specified as zero, then unshare() is a no-op; no changes are
       made to the calling process&apos;s execution context.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and errno  is  set
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid bit was specified in flags.

       ENOMEM Cannot  allocate  sufficient memory to copy parts of caller&apos;s con&#8208;
              text that need to be unshared.

       EPERM  The calling process did not have the required privileges for  this
              operation.

VERSIONS
       The unshare() system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.

CONFORMING TO
       The unshare() system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Not  all  of the process attributes that can be shared when a new process
       is created using clone(2) can be unshared using unshare().   In  particu&#8208;
       lar, as at kernel 2.6.16, unshare() does not implement flags that reverse
       the effects of CLONE_SIGHAND, CLONE_SYSVSEM, CLONE_THREAD,  or  CLONE_VM.
       Such functionality may be added in the future, if required.
