UNWRAPDIFF(1)                       Man pages                      UNWRAPDIFF(1)



NAME
       unwrapdiff - demangle word-wrapped patches

SYNOPSIS
       unwrapdiff [-v] [file...]

       unwrapdiff {[--help] | [--version]}

DESCRIPTION
       unwrapdiff demangles patches that have been word-wrapped, in an attempt
       to make them useful.

       The corrected diff is sent to standard output. Note that you will
       probably need to use the -l option when applying the patch, in order to
       ignore any whitespace differences there may be.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Verbose operation. A list of lines that are modified in a way that
           might be wrong is sent to stderr.

       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
           Display the version number of unwrapdiff.

LIMITATIONS
       Some heuristics are used to decide whether use a space to recombine a
       wrapped line, or just join them together. Currently this is done by
       comparing with last three characters of a line with the first two
       characters of its continuation, and using a space if any of them are
       different.

       The patch needs to have been valid before being word-wrapped.

       The last line of a hunk is nearly always ambiguous. If the next line
       begins &#8220;@@&#8221;, &#8220;Index: &#8221;, &#8220;diff &#8221; or &#8220;--- &#8221; then it is taken to be
       complete; otherwise it is unwrapped using the next line.
