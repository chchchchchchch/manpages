Update-AUCTeX-elisp(8)       Debian GNU/Linux Manual      Update-AUCTeX-elisp(8)



NAME
       update-auctex-elisp  -  Update  AUCTeX automatically generated TeX macros
       and LaTeX styles data

SYNOPSIS
       update-auctex-elisp [--daemon] [--no-act] [FLAVOR ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The update-auctex-elisp script updates the  automatically  generated  TeX
       and  LaTeX  data  used  by AUCTeX and stored in /var/lib/auctex/&lt;FLAVOR&gt;,
       where &lt;FLAVOR&gt; stands for any valid installed Emacs flavor.

       It is called automatically by the Debian auctex package (via  dpkg  trig&#8208;
       gers)  whenever  new  (La)TeX macros and style files are installed in the
       TeX and METAFONT system trees; beside, it is called on GNU AUCTeX and GNU
       Emacs  flavor  upgrades  and installations, to ensure up to date parsing.
       It may and should also be called manually after additions  to  the  local
       TeX and METAFONT system tree.

       If  no  arguments are specified, update-auctex-elisp caters to every sup&#8208;
       ported GNU Emacs flavor installed on the system; else it updates only the
       specified flavors, if they are installed.
