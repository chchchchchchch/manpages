UPDATE-CA-CERTIFICATES(8)                              UPDATE-CA-CERTIFICATES(8)



NAME
       update-ca-certificates - update /etc/ssl/certs and certificates.crt

SYNOPSIS
       update-ca-certificates [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the update-ca-certificates commands.
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution.

       update-ca-certificates  is  a  program   that   updates   the   directory
       /etc/ssl/certs to hold SSL certificates and generates certificates.crt, a
       concatenated single-file list of certificates.

       It reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf. Each line gives  a  pathname
       of  a  CA  certificate  under  /usr/share/ca-certificates  that should be
       trusted.  Lines that begin with &quot;#&quot; are comment lines and  thus  ignored.
       Lines that begin with &quot;!&quot; are deselected, causing the deactivation of the
       CA certificate in question.

       Furthermore all certificates found below /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
       are also included as implicitly trusted.

       Before  terminating, update-ca-certificates invokes run-parts on /etc/ca-
       certificates/update.d and calls each hook with a  list  of  certificates:
       those added are prefixed with a +, those removed are prefixed with a -.
