UPDATE-DEFAULT-WORDLIST(8)                            UPDATE-DEFAULT-WORDLIST(8)



NAME
       update-default-wordlist - update default wordlist

SYNOPSIS
        update-default-wordlist [--dico-postinst] [--triggered]

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: Not to be used from the command line unless you know very well
       what you are doing.

       This program is intended to be called from wordlist package postinst,
       from select-default-wordlist or from dictionaries-common postinst (with
       --dico-postinst).

       When called under dpkg control without the --dico-postinst option, a
       dictionaries-common trigger is enabled to be run later.  In the triggered
       run (or when is called from the command line or with --trigger option),
       reads the system default from the debconf database and set default links
       in /etc/dictionaries-common pointing to the appropriate files in
       /usr/share/dict/.  and rebuilds the
       /var/cache/dictionaries-common/wordlist.db  from the files in
       /var/lib/dictionaries-common/wordlist

       When called from from dictionaries-common postinst with --dico-postinst
       symlinks creation step will be skipped and trigger not enabled.

OPTIONS
       --dico-postinst  Do not enable trigger nor try to set default symlinks.
       --triggered      Run all the code instead of trying to enable
                        update-default-wordlist trigger
