UPDATE-EXIM4.CONF.TEMPLATE(8)                      UPDATE-EXIM4.CONF.TEMPLATE(8)



NAME
       update-exim4.conf.template  -  Regenerate  exim4  configuration file tem&#8208;
       plate.

SYNOPSIS
       update-exim4.conf.template [-h|--help] [-n|--nobackup] [-o|--output file]
       [-r|--run]


OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              Show short help message and exit

       -n|--nobackup
              Overwrite    existing    file,    instead   of   keeping   it   as
              /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.bak.random-number

       -o|--output file
              Write output to file instead of /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.

       -r|--run
              Actually  do  something.  If  this   option   is   not   specified
              update-exim4.conf.template  will exit immediately. This option was
              introduced because update-exim4.conf.template overwrites  configu&#8208;
              ration files.


DESCRIPTION
       The  script update-exim4.conf.template regenerates the main configuration
       file template /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template from the configuration snip&#8208;
       pets in the /etc/exim4/conf.d directory tree.

       This     process     will     overwrite     all    local    changes    in
       /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template and might be useful  if  there  are  local
       changes  in  the  /etc/exim4/conf.d  directory tree, for example by a new
       mail related package dropping its own configuration snippets in there.

       update-exim4.conf.template ignores all files in the conf.d directory that
       have  a  filename which does not consist only of letters, numbers, under&#8208;
       scores and hyphens ([:alnum:]_-),  similar  to  run-parts(8).   For  easy
       interaction     with     packages     extending     Exim     additionally
       /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar.rul       is       used       instead        of
       /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar if it exists!


ENVIRONMENT
       If  CONFDIR  is  set update-exim4.conf.template will search for the input
       files below $CONFDIR/conf.d instead of /etc/exim4/conf.d/ and will  write
       the    output    to    $CONFDIR/exim4.conf.template    instead    of   to
       /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template (unless overridden with -o or --output).



BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody  knows  better  groff
       than  us  and  has  more  experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
