update-fontlang(8)            Debian User&apos;s Manual            update-fontlang(8)



NAME
       update-language,  update-fmtutil,  update-fmtlang  -  update various TeX-
       related configuration files


SYNOPSIS
       update-language [options]
       update-fmtutil [options]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains briefly the usage of the three  TeX  configura&#8208;
       tion update programs update-language and update-fmtutil.

       The  update-fontlang  script  should not be called directly, but only via
       the two described links.  For a more in-depth description, please see the
       document  TeX on Debian in /usr/share/doc/tex-common/TeX-on-Debian.txt.gz
       (also available as HTML and PDF).

       The programs update-language and update-fmtutil create or update the con&#8208;
       figuration files language.dat and fmtutil.cnf, respectively.  These files
       define the hyphenation patterns to be loaded into LaTeX-related TeX  for&#8208;
       mats (language.dat), and the list of formats to be created (fmtutil.cnf).

       These  programs can be used either in system-wide mode if called by root,
       or in a user-specific mode if called by a user without super-user  privi&#8208;
       leges.

OPTIONS
       -c DIR, --conf-dir=DIR
              directory  where  the user-specific configuration files are looked
              for in  user-specific  mode  (default  TEXMFCONFIG/language.d  for
              update-language  and  TEXMFCONFIG/fmt.d  for update-fmtutil, where
              TEXMFCONFIG is usually $HOME/.texmf-config).

       -o FILE, --output-file=FILE
              file to write the output to. Per  default,  in  system-wide  mode,
              update-language  writes  to /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/lan&#8208;
              guage.dat and update-fmtutil writes to  /var/lib/texmf/web2c/fmtu&#8208;
              til.cnf.

       --checks
              perform sanity checks on the generated config file. Don&apos;t use this
              in maintainer scripts.

       --quiet
              don&apos;t write anything to the standard output during  normal  opera&#8208;
              tion

       --help print a summary of the command-line usage and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


USAGE
       In  system-wide  mode,  both  programs  merge those files (&quot;configuration
       snippets&quot;) with a specific  extension  in  the  respective  configuration
       directories  to  produce  the final file. These configuration directories
       and extensions are language.d and .cnf for update-language, and fmt.d and
       .cnf  for  update-fmtutil.   In  system-wide  mode, these directories are
       those under /etc/texmf/. Both TeX add-on packages and  local  administra&#8208;
       tors can add files to these directories.

       If  a  package  that  provides  such  snippets is removed but not purged,
       including the snippet will likely  break  the  system.   To  prevent  the
       inclusion  in these cases, snippets installed by packages have to contain
       a magic header:

       # -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-

       which local administrators should not remove.   From  the  files  with  a
       magic  header, only those files which are also listed in one of the files
       in    /var/lib/tex-common/language-cnf/    for    update-language,    and
       /var/lib/tex-common/fmtutil-cnf/   for   update-fmtutil,   are   actually
       included into the final output file. This way, local changes to the  con&#8208;
       figuration  can be preserved while the package is in state &apos;rc&apos; (that is,
       the package is removed, but its configuration files are  still  present).
       For  details about this mechanism, package maintainers should consult the
       Debian TeX Policy.  As a special case, the files for JadeTeX  and  xmlTeX
       are  only  included  if there is already a file for the LaTeX format (see
       TeX on Debian for details).

       The user-specific mode provides a way for a non-admin  user  to  override
       system-wide  settings.   In  this  mode, update-language writes to TEXMF&#8208;
       VAR/tex/generic/config/language.dat, and update-fmtutil writes to  TEXMF&#8208;
       VAR/web2c/fmtutil.cnf,  where TEXMFVAR is usually $HOME/.texmf-var.  Fur&#8208;
       thermore, files present within the user-specific  configuration  directo&#8208;
       ries  are  included  in  addition to the files present in the system-wide
       configuration directories.  In case the same filename exists in the  sys&#8208;
       tem-wide  configuration  directory  and  the  user-specific configuration
       directory, the user-specific file is used instead of the system-wide one.
       The  user-specific  configuration  directories are TEXMFCONFIG/language.d
       for update-language and TEXMFCONFIG/fmt.d for update-fmtutil, where TEXM&#8208;
       FCONFIG  is  usually  $HOME/.texmf-config.  The system-wide configuration
       directories have the same names, but are located in  /etc/texmf/  instead
       of TEXMFCONFIG.

       Note that changes introduced by updates of packages are not propagated to
       the user&apos;s configuration files. This has to be done by hand.

              a debhelper-like script for managing  the  installation  of  files
              into  the system-wide configuration directories; this script helps
              to write Debian packages  containing  TeX-related  resources  that
              conform to the Debian TeX Policy.
