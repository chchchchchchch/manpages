update-fonts-dir(8)                                          update-fonts-dir(8)



NAME
       update-fonts-dir - compile fonts.dir files

SYNOPSIS
       update-fonts-dir [OPTION] directory ...

DESCRIPTION
       update-fonts-dir  creates  a  fonts.dir  file  in  an X font directory by
       invoking mkfontdir(1x) with the appropriate arguments.  It  is  typically
       invoked  only  from  the  post-installation and post-removal scripts of a
       package containing fonts for the X Window System, but may be  invoked  at
       any  time  to  reconstruct fonts.dir files.  For each directory, which is
       simply the last component of  its  path  (such  as  &#8216;75dpi&#8217;  or  &#8216;misc&#8217;),
       update-fonts-dir    will    generate   either   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/direc&#8208;
       tory/fonts.dir  or  /usr/share/fonts/X11/directory/fonts.dir   from   the
       fonts.scale and font files found within it.

       This  enables  multiple  packages  to provide names for fonts in the same
       directory.  No font package actually provides the fonts.dir file in the X
       font directory itself, so there is no danger of overwriting one package&apos;s
       font names with those of another.

       For instance, the two packages &#8216;xfonts-base&#8217;  (real)  and  &#8216;xfonts-nifty&#8217;
       (hypothetical)    may    both    install   fonts   into   the   directory
       /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc,  and  update-fonts-dir  will  ensure  that   the
       fonts.dir  file  in  that  directory  contains information about the font
       files provided by both packages.

       The format of fonts.dir files is described in  the  mkfontdir(1x)  manual
       page.

       An  example  of how to use update-fonts-dir in package maintainer scripts
       is provided in the Debian Policy Manual.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help displays a brief usage message and exits.

       -7, --x11r7-layout switches the font layout  to  the  one  introduced  in
       X11R7:  fonts  in  /usr/share/fonts/X11/directory  (default  is: fonts in
       /usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory)

OPERANDS
       update-fonts-dir takes one or more X font directory names to  operate  on
       as  operands.  Only the final path component of the directory name should
       be specified; e.g.,
              update-fonts-dir 75dpi
       is correct, while &#8216;update-fonts-dir  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&#8217;  and
       &#8216;update-fonts-dir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&#8217; are not.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS
              indicates  the  width  of  the terminal device in character cells.
              This value is used for formatting  diagnostic  messages.   If  not
              set, the terminal is queried using stty(1) to determine its width.
              If that fails, a value of &#8216;80&#8217; is assumed.

DIAGNOSTICS
   Errors
       usage error: one or more font directories must be provided
              update-fonts-dir was invoked without operands.  Supply one or more
              X font directory names to operate on.
&#12;       usage error: unrecognized option
              update-fonts-dir was invoked with an unrecognized option argument.
              Use only the options documented in &#8220;OPTIONS&#8221;, above.

       fatal error: path to X font directory must be used
              A directory name was supplied that was not  an  X  font  directory
              name.  Supply X font directory names only.

   Warnings
       warning: absolute path directory was provided
              Usage  of absolute paths is deprecated.  Use only the final compo&#8208;
              nent of the X font directory name for directory.

       warning: directory does not exist or is not a directory
              The supplied directory was invalid.  update-fonts-dir skipped it.

EXIT STATUS
       0      update-fonts-dir ran successfully.

       1      update-fonts-dir experienced a fatal error;  see  the  section  on
              diagnostic messages above.

       2      update-fonts-dir was invoked with invalid arguments.
