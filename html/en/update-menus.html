UPDATE-MENUS(1)                                                  UPDATE-MENUS(1)



NAME
       update-menus - generate Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS
       update-menus  [-v]  [-d]  [-h|--help]  [--version] [--menufilesdir &lt;dir&gt;]
       [--menumethod &lt;method&gt;] [--nodefaultdirs] [--stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Before  the  advent  of  update-menus,  when  the  system  administrators
       installed a package onto a Debian system, they would need to edit various
       window manager configuration files to make the new program  show  up  on,
       for example, fvwm&apos;s menus. The menus could easily become out of sync with
       what programs were actually available, with some menu items  that  didn&apos;t
       work,  and  other  programs  that  lacked a menu entry.  update-menus and
       Debian&apos;s menu package aim to solve this problem.

       update-menus automatically generates menus of installed programs for win&#8208;
       dow  managers  and other menu programs. It should be run whenever a menu&#8208;
       file(5) or menu-method file is changed.  update-menus will be  run  auto&#8208;
       matically  when  Debian packages that contain menu files are installed on
       or removed from the system.

       update-menus   uses   the   package-supplied   menu   entry   files   (in
       /usr/share/menu)  for  its  information  about the menus (but this can be
       overruled by the system administrator/user; see below). If a  menu  entry
       file  is  executable, update-menus executes the menu entry file, and uses
       its stdout to generate the menu database.


OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose output. Shows all arguments to the /etc/menu-methods  pro&#8208;
              grams.

       -d     Debug output. Generates loads of unintelligible output.

       -h, --help
              Display usage help and exit.

       --menufilesdir &lt;dir&gt;
              Adds directory &lt;dir&gt; to the list of directories to search for menu
              files in.

       --menumethod &lt;method&gt;
              Process only the menu method &lt;method&gt;  instead  of  all  the  menu
              methods found.

       --nodefaultdirs
              Disables the search of menu entries in system menu directories.

       --nodpkgcheck
              Do  not  discard  menu entries for packages that are not installed
              according to dpkg.

       --remove
              Remove the menus by calling the menu-methods with --remove.

       --stdout
              Output the menu list in a format suitable as  input  for  install-
              menu or a menu method file.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.
&#12;CONFIGURATION
       There are several ways to tune the operation of update-menus:

       per menu entry, in /etc/menu/$package
              In these directories the system administrator or user can override
              the default menu files (If a file /etc/menu/$package exists,  than
              the  corresponding  /usr/share/menu/$package  file  isn&apos;t read any
              more). Users who want to override the  system  wide  defaults  put
              their files in ~/.menu. See also menufile(5)
       per window-manager in /etc/menu-methods/$wm
              In   these  configuration  files,  one  can  tune  generated  sys&#8208;
              tem.${wm}rc files for each individual window manager. For example,
              one can specify that the wm should ignore any icons that the pack&#8208;
              ages may supply, or set the default wrapper for text-only applica&#8208;
              tions (usually, an xterm is started to run a text-only application
              like vi). Users who want to override the system wide defaults  put
              their    files    in   ~/.menu-methods.   For   more   info,   see
              /usr/share/doc/menu/html.
       globally, in /etc/menu-methods/translate_menus
              This file contains translations that will  be  performed  for  all
              menu entries and all window managers. You can specify things like:
              `All sections that start with &quot;Games&quot; should be mapped to  &quot;Appli&#8208;
              cations/Games&quot;&apos;,  or  `menuentry  &quot;gnuplot&quot; should have a title of
              &quot;GnuTeken&quot;&apos;. Look at the default /etc/menu-methods/translate_menus
              for  an  example.  Users  who  want to override the system default
              translate file, put one in ~/.menu-methods/translate_menus.  Note:
              This should not be used for a full translation of the menu. Use po
              files as explained in the source package.
       error report configuring, in /etc/menu-methods/menu.config
              This file contains general information for the  overall  behaviour
              of  update-menus. At the moment you can only configure how verbose
              the output of update-menus is, and where it sends the output.  The
              amount   of  information  is  specified  by  `verbosity=VAL&apos;.  Use
              VAL=quiet to stop update-menu from reporting anything but the most
              important  errors, VAL=normal, VAL=verbose, VAL=debug for progres&#8208;
              sively more output.

              To specify  where  the  output  should  go,  use  `method=stdout&apos;,
              `method=stderr&apos;,  or `method=syslog facility priority&apos;. `Facility&apos;
              is one of auth, authpriv, authcron, authdaemon, authkern,  authlo&#8208;
              cal0,  authlocal1, authlocal2, authlocal3, authlocal4, authlocal5,
              authlocal6, authlocal7, authlpr, authmail,  authnews,  authsyslog,
              authuser,  authuucp. `priority&apos; is one of emerg, alert, crit, err,
              warning, notice, info, debug.


FILES
       Menu files: (Earlier listed directories override those listed later.)
              ~/.menu/*
                     Menu files added by the user.  (Isn&apos;t  read  if  root  runs
                     update-menus)
              /etc/menu/*
                     Menu files added by the system administrator.
              /usr/lib/menu/*
                     Architecture-dependant  menu files provided by other Debian
                     packages.
              /usr/share/menu/*
                     Architecture-independant  menu  files  provided  by   other
                     Debian packages.
              /usr/share/menu/default/*
                     Menu files provided by the menu package.
       Menu methods:
              /etc/menu-methods/
                     Executable  configuration  files  that  are added by window
                     managers and other menu programs, these files  are  run  by
                     update-menus  to generate menus for the different programs.
                     Also in this directory is the  translate_menus  file,  used
                     for local configuration of the shape of the menu trees.
              ~/.menu-methods/
                     For  users  to  override  the system-defaults of /etc/menu-
                     methods.  If this directory exists, no files in  /etc/menu-
                     methods are read any more.

BUGS
       update-menus may not work properly when run by a normal user, to generate
       menus for that user. This is usually because the window  manager  doesn&apos;t
       expect  the system.${wm}rc files in the directory (usually ~/.${wm}, con&#8208;
       figurable in /etc/menu-methods). If you see such a thing, and you find  a
       solution,  please  mail &lt;menu@packages.debian.org&gt;. It should work OK for
       fvwm and fvwm2: I usually test the package first as an ordinary user.

THANKS
       To Joey Hess, for a lot of good ideas and pre-release testing, and to Tom
       Lees for a update-menus in pure C (of which I only used one function, but
       that&apos;s life).
