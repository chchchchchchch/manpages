UPDATE-PASSWD(8)                                                UPDATE-PASSWD(8)



NAME
       update-passwd - safely update /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group

SYNOPSIS
       update-passwd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       update-passwd  handles updates of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group
       on running Debian systems.  It  compares  the  current  files  to  master
       copies,  distributed  in the base-passwd package, and updates all entries
       in the global system range (that is, 0&#8211;99).

OPTIONS
       update-passwd follows the  usual  GNU  command  line  syntax,  with  long
       options starting with two dashes (&#8216;-&#8217;).

       -p, --passwd-master=FILE
              Use  FILE  as the master copy of the passwd database.  The default
              value is /usr/share/base-passwd/passwd.master.

       -g, --group-master=FILE
              Use FILE as the master copy of the group  database.   The  default
              value is /usr/share/base-passwd/group.master.

       -P, --passwd=FILE
              Use  FILE  as  the  system  passwd database.  The default value is
              /etc/passwd.

       -S, --shadow=FILE
              Use FILE as the system shadow  database.   The  default  value  is
              /etc/shadow.

       -G, --group=FILE
              Use  FILE  as  the  system  group  database.  The default value is
              /etc/group.

       -s, --sanity-check
              Only perform sanity-checks but don&apos;t do anything.

       -v, --verbose
              Give detailed information about what we are doing.   A  second  -v
              gives additional detail.

       -n, --dry-run
              Don&apos;t do anything but only show what we would do.

       -L, --no-locking
              Don&apos;t  attempt  to lock the account database.  This should only be
              used for debugging purposes.  I repeat: do not do this unless  you
              are really sure you need this!

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of how to use update-passwd.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number

BUGS
       At  this moment update-passwd does not verify the shadow-file.  It should
       check if the entries in the passwd are also in shadow and vice versa, and
       that passwords are not present in both files.
