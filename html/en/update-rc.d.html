UPDATE-RC.D(8)                       sysv-rc                      UPDATE-RC.D(8)



NAME
       update-rc.d - install and remove System-V style init script links

SYNOPSIS
       update-rc.d [-n] [-f] name remove

       update-rc.d [-n] name defaults [NN | SS KK]

       update-rc.d [-n] name start|stop NN runlevel [runlevel]...  .  start|stop
              NN runlevel [runlevel]...  . ...

       update-rc.d [-n] name disable|enable [ S|2|3|4|5 ]

DESCRIPTION
       update-rc.d updates the System V  style  init  script  links  /etc/rcrun&#8208;
       level.d/NNname  whose target is the script /etc/init.d/name.  These links
       are run by init when it changes runlevels; they  are  generally  used  to
       start  and  stop system services such as daemons.  runlevel is one of the
       runlevels supported by init, namely, 0123456789S, and NN is the two-digit
       sequence  number  that determines where in the sequence init will run the
       scripts.

       This manpage documents only the usage and behaviour of update-rc.d.   For
       a  discussion  of  the System V style init script arrangements please see
       init(8) and the Debian Policy Manual.


INSTALLING INIT SCRIPT LINKS
       update-rc.d has two modes of operation for installing  scripts  into  the
       boot  sequence.   A  legacy mode where command line arguments are used to
       decide the sequence and runlevel  configuration,  and  the  default  mode
       where  dependency  and runlevel information in the init.d script LSB com&#8208;
       ment header is used instead.  Such header is required to  be  present  in
       init.d scripts.  See the insserv(8) manual page for details about the LSB
       header format.  The boot sequencing method is decided during installation
       or  upgrades.  During upgrades, if there are no loops in the dependencies
       declared by LSB headers of all installed init.d scripts and  no  obsolete
       init.d  scripts,  the  boot  system is converted to dependency based boot
       sequencing.  The  conversion  to  dependency  based  boot  sequencing  is
       one-way.    The   machines  using  the  legacy  mode  will  have  a  file
       /etc/init.d/.legacy-bootordering .

       Packages installing init.d scripts should make sure  both  methods  work,
       for compatiblity with systems where the migration have not been done yet.

       For legacy mode, the following section documents the old behaviour.

       When  run  with  either the defaults, start, or stop options, update-rc.d
       makes  links  /etc/rcrunlevel.d/[SK]NNname  that  point  to  the   script
       /etc/init.d/name.

       If  any files /etc/rcrunlevel.d/[SK]??name already exist then update-rc.d
       does nothing.  The program was written this way so  that  it  will  never
       change  an  existing configuration, which may have been customized by the
       system administrator.  The program will only install links  if  none  are
       present,  i.e.,  if  it appears that the service has never been installed
       before.

       A common system administration error is to  delete  the  links  with  the
       thought  that  this will &quot;disable&quot; the service, i.e., that this will pre&#8208;
       vent the service from being started.  However, if  all  links  have  been
       deleted  then  the  next  time  the  package  is  upgraded, the package&apos;s
       postinst script will run update-rc.d again and this will reinstall  links
       at  their factory default locations.  The correct way to disable services
       is to configure the service as stopped in all runlevels in  which  it  is
       started  by default.  In the System V init system this means renaming the
       service&apos;s symbolic links from S to K.

       If defaults is used then update-rc.d will make links to start the service
       in  runlevels  2345 and to stop the service in runlevels 016.  By default
       all the links will have sequence number 20, but this should be overridden
       if  there  are dependencies. For example if daemon B depends on A, then A
       must be started before B and B must be killed before  A.  You  accomplish
       this by supplying two NN arguments. In general, core daemons should start
       early and be killed late, whilst  applications  can  start  late  and  be
       killed early. See EXAMPLES below.

       The  first  NN argument supplies the start sequence number and the second
       NN argument supplies the kill sequence number.  Kill scripts  are  called
       first,  passing  a stop argument. Then start scripts are called passing a
       start argument. In either case, calls happen in ascending sequence number
       order.

       Supplying  a  single  NN argument will use the same number for both start
       and kill links. This is supported for backward compatibility but is  dis&#8208;
       couraged, as it may lead to inconsistent settings. As a rule of thumb, if
       you increase the start sequence number you should also decrease the  stop
       sequence number, and vice-versa.

       As  a  rule  of thumb, the sequence number of the stop link should be 100
       minus the sequence number of the start link; this causes services  to  be
       stopped  in  the opposite order to that in which they are started.  Obvi&#8208;
       ously,  therefore,  the  default  stop  sequence  number  should  be  80.
       Defaulting to 20, as update-rc.d does, is an old bug that cannot be fixed
       because of the risk of breaking things.

       Instead of defaults one can give one or more sets of arguments specifying
       particular  runlevels  in  which  to  start or stop the service.  Each of
       these sets of arguments starts with the  keyword  start  or  stop  and  a
       sequence number NN, followed by one or more runlevel numbers.  The set is
       terminated by a solitary full stop character.  When  explicit  specifica&#8208;
       tion,  rather  than defaults, is used there will usually be one start and
       one stop set.  If different sequence codes are required in different run&#8208;
       levels then several start sets or several stop sets may be specified.  If
       this is done and the same runlevel is named in multiple  sets  then  only
       the  last  one  counts.   Therefore it is not possible to create multiple
       start or multiple stop links for a service in a  single  runlevel  direc&#8208;
       tory.

       The  script /etc/init.d/name must exist before update-rc.d is run to cre&#8208;
       ate the links.

REMOVING SCRIPTS
       When invoked with the remove option, update-rc.d removes any links in the
       /etc/rcrunlevel.d directories to the script /etc/init.d/name.  The script
       must have been deleted already.  If the  script  is  still  present  then
       update-rc.d aborts with an error message.

       update-rc.d  is  usually called from a package&apos;s post-removal script when
       that script is given the purge argument.  Any files  in  the  /etc/rcrun&#8208;
       level.d   directories   that   are  not  symbolic  links  to  the  script
       /etc/init.d/name will be left untouched.

DISABLING INIT SCRIPT START LINKS
       When run with the disable [ S|2|3|4|5  ]  options,  update-rc.d  modifies
       existing runlevel links for the script /etc/init.d/name by renaming start
       links to stop links with a sequence number equal to the difference of 100
       minus the original sequence number.

       When  run  with  the  enable  [ S|2|3|4|5 ] options, update-rc.d modifies
       existing runlevel links for the script /etc/init.d/name by renaming  stop
       links to start links with a sequence number equal to the positive differ&#8208;
       ence of current sequence number minus 100, thus returning to the original
       sequence  number that the script had been installed with before disabling
       it.

       Both of these options only operate on start runlevel links of S, 2, 3,  4
       or  5. If no start runlevel is specified after the disable or enable key&#8208;
       words, the script will attempt to modify links in all start runlevels.


OPTIONS
       -n     Don&apos;t do anything, just show what we would do.

       -f     Force removal of symlinks even if /etc/init.d/name still exists.

EXAMPLES
       Insert links using the defaults:
          update-rc.d foobar defaults
       The equivalent dependency header would have start and stop
       dependencies on $remote_fs and $syslog, and start in
       runlevels 2-5 and stop in runlevels 0, 1 and 6.
       Equivalent command using explicit argument sets:
          update-rc.d foobar start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 .
       More typical command using explicit argument sets:
          update-rc.d foobar start 30 2 3 4 5 . stop 70 0 1 6 .
       Insert links at default runlevels when B requires A
          update-rc.d script_for_A defaults 80 20
          update-rc.d script_for_B defaults 90 10
       Insert a link to a service that (presumably) will not be  needed  by  any
       other daemon
          update-rc.d top_level_app defaults 98 02
       Insert  links  for  a  script  that  requires services that start/stop at
       sequence number 20
          update-rc.d script_depends_on_svc20 defaults 21 19
       Remove all links for a script (assuming foobar has been deleted already):
          update-rc.d foobar remove
       Example of disabling a service:
          update-rc.d -f foobar remove
          update-rc.d foobar stop 20 2 3 4 5 .
       Example of a command for installing a system  initialization-and-shutdown
       script:
          update-rc.d foobar start 45 S . stop 31 0 6 .
       Example  of  a command for disabling a system initialization-and-shutdown
       script:
          update-rc.d -f foobar remove
          update-rc.d foobar stop 45 S .
