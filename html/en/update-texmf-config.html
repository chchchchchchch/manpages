NAME
       update-texmf-config  -  script used in maintainer scripts to trigger tex-
       common actions

SYNOPSIS
       update-texmf-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the update-texmf-config command.  This
       manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
       original script was designed for Debian packaging system.

       update-texmf-config is a shell script  that  is  called  from  maintainer
       scripts  shipping  new  map files, hyphenation patterns, or any other TeX
       input file.

       The script simply activates the respective trigger, namely texmf-map  for
       font  map files, texmf-hyphen for hyphenation patterns, and texmf-lsr for
       updates to the lsr database. All the necessary action will then  be  car&#8208;
       ried out by the tex-common package.

OPTIONS
       map    Activate the texmf-map trigger.

       hyphen Activate the texmf-hyphen trigger.

       lsr    Activate the texmf-lsr trigger.
