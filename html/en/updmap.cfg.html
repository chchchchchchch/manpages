UPDMAP.CFG(5)                       TeX Live                       UPDMAP.CFG(5)



NAME
       updmap.cfg  -  configuration  of  font  mapping/inclusion  for  dvips and
       friends.

DESCRIPTION
       The file updmap.cfg is the central font configuration  file  of  a  teTeX
       system  and is read by updmap(1). It describes if and how fonts should be
       included (or not included) into PS-/PDF-files.  This  works  for  Outline
       (Postscript Type1) and Bitmap Fonts (Postscript Type3) mostly coming from
       MetaFont.

       updmap is a utility that creates font configuration files  for  dvips(1),
       pdftex(1),  xdvi(1),  ps2pk(1), gsftopk(1), and dvipdfmx(1).  In an ideal
       world, updmap would be unnecessary -- each of these programs  would  read
       the  same  configuration  file  to learn what fonts are available and how
       they should be treated.  As things stand, however, each  of  these  tools
       has subtly different requirements and thereby needs its own font configu&#8208;
       ration file.  updmap creates font configuration files for  all  of  these
       programs  from  several  sources,  namely all updmap.cfg, allowing you to
       easily keep all the different configuration files in sync.

       dvipsPreferOutline
       Configures if dvips (by default) should prefer bitmap  fonts  or  outline
       fonts if both are available? Independent of this setting, outlines can be
       forced by putting &quot;p psfonts_t1.map&quot; into a config file that dvips reads.
       Bitmaps  can  be forced by putting &quot;p psfonts_pk.map&quot; into a config file.
       We provide such config files which can be  enabled  via  dvips  -Poutline
       (resp. dvips -Ppk).
       Valid settings for dvipsPreferOutline are true / false.

       LW35
       Which  fonts  of  the &quot;Basic 35 Laserwriter Fonts&quot; do you want to use and
       how are the filenames chosen? Valid settings:
       URW:     URW fonts with &quot;vendor&quot; filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
       URWkb:   URW fonts with &quot;berry&quot; filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
       ADOBE:   Adobe fonts with &quot;vendor&quot; filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)
       ADOBEkb: Adobe fonts with  &quot;berry&quot; filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)

       dvipsDownloadBase35
       Configures if dvips (by default) should download the standard  35  Laser&#8208;
       Writer  fonts  into the document (set true) or should these fonts be used
       from the ps interpreter / printer (set false).
       The user can override the default by specifying dvips -Pdownload35 (resp.
       dvips  -Pbuiltin35)  to  download  the LW35 fonts (resp. use the built-in
       fonts).
       Valid settings are true / false.

       pdftexDownloadBase14
       Should pdftex download the base 14 pdf fonts? Since  some  configurations
       (ps  /  pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to down&#8208;
       load the fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though.
       Valid settings are true (download the fonts) or false (don&apos;t download the
       fonts). Adobe recommends to embed all fonts.

       pxdviUse
       Should  special  map  files for pxdvi be created? pxdvi is an adaption of
       xdvi with support for reading and displaying files generated by the  ptex
       family of engines.
       Valid   settings   are   true  (generate  configuration)  or  false.  See
       http://www.tug.org/texlive/updmap-kanji.html for detailed discussion.

       kanjiEmbed
       kanjiVariant
       The options kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant specify special  replacements  in
       the map lines.  If a map contains the string @kanjiEmbed@, then this will
       be replaced by the value of that option; similarly for kanjiVariant.   In
       this way, users of Japanese TeX can select different fonts to be included
       in the final output.

       Map
       Points to a map file, which describes a mapping from a  font  (called  in
       the TeX document) to the pfb file containing the Postscript code.
       Usage: Map filename.map

       The  syntax  of  map files is the same as dvips(1) uses, see section 6.4,
       &quot;&apos;psfonts.map&apos;: PostScript font  catalog&quot;  in  the  manual  of  dvips(1),
       available as info and pdf file.

       MixedMap
       Similar to Map. It should be used when there is Type1 and a bitmap imple&#8208;
       mentation of the font (the latter mostly  coming  from  MetaFont).  These
       entries  will  not be used in the default map of dvips if dvipsPreferOut&#8208;
       line is set to false.
       Usage: MixedMap filename.map

       KanjiMap
       Similar to Map. It should be used for kanji fonts.
       Usage: KanjiMap filename.map

       The sign # precedes a comment.

       Not used Map files should be commented out using the  string  #!  at  the
       beginning  of  the line. These entries can be (de-)activated using updmap
       with the options --enable and --disable.
