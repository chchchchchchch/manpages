NAME
       uptime - Tell how long the system has been running.

SYNOPSIS
       uptime [options]

DESCRIPTION
       uptime  gives  a one line display of the following information.  The cur&#8208;
       rent time, how long the system has been running, how many users are  cur&#8208;
       rently  logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15
       minutes.

       This is the same information contained in the header  line  displayed  by
       w(1).

       System  load  averages is the average number of processes that are either
       in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is
       either  using  the  CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninter&#8208;
       ruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.   The
       averages  are taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not
       normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a  load  average  of  1
       means  a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system
       it means it was idle 75% of the time.
