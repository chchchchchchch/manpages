NAME
       uri, url, urn - uniform resource identifier (URI), including a URL or URN

SYNOPSIS
       URI = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ &quot;#&quot; fragment ]

       absoluteURI = scheme &quot;:&quot; ( hierarchical_part | opaque_part )

       relativeURI = ( net_path | absolute_path | relative_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]

       scheme = &quot;http&quot; | &quot;ftp&quot; | &quot;gopher&quot; | &quot;mailto&quot; | &quot;news&quot; | &quot;telnet&quot; |
                  &quot;file&quot; | &quot;man&quot; | &quot;info&quot; | &quot;whatis&quot; | &quot;ldap&quot; | &quot;wais&quot; | ...

       hierarchical_part = ( net_path | absolute_path ) [ &quot;?&quot; query ]

       net_path = &quot;//&quot; authority [ absolute_path ]

       absolute_path = &quot;/&quot;  path_segments

       relative_path = relative_segment [ absolute_path ]

DESCRIPTION
       A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a short string of characters iden&#8208;
       tifying an abstract or physical resource (for example, a  web  page).   A
       Uniform  Resource  Locator  (URL)  is  a  URI  that identifies a resource
       through its primary access  mechanism  (e.g.,  its  network  &quot;location&quot;),
       rather  than by name or some other attribute of that resource.  A Uniform
       Resource Name (URN) is a URI that must remain globally unique and persis&#8208;
       tent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.

       URIs  are  the standard way to name hypertext link destinations for tools
       such as web browsers.  The string &quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot; is  a  URL
       (and  thus  it is also a URI).  Many people use the term URL loosely as a
       synonym for URI (though technically URLs are a subset of URIs).

       URIs can be absolute or relative.  An absolute  identifier  refers  to  a
       resource  independent of context, while a relative identifier refers to a
       resource by describing the difference from the current context.  Within a
       relative  path  reference,  the  complete path segments &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; have
       special meanings: &quot;the current hierarchy level&quot; and &quot;the level above this
       hierarchy  level&quot;,  respectively, just like they do in UNIX-like systems.
       A path segment which contains a colon character  can&apos;t  be  used  as  the
       first  segment  of  a  relative  URI path (e.g., &quot;this:that&quot;), because it
       would be mistaken for a scheme name; precede such segments with ./ (e.g.,
       &quot;./this:that&quot;).   Note  that  descendants of MS-DOS (e.g., Microsoft Win&#8208;
       dows) replace devicename colons with the vertical bar (&quot;|&quot;) in  URIs,  so
       &quot;C:&quot; becomes &quot;C|&quot;.

       A  fragment identifier, if included, refers to a particular named portion
       (fragment) of a resource; text after a &apos;#&apos; identifies  the  fragment.   A
       URI beginning with &apos;#&apos; refers to that fragment in the current resource.

   Usage
       There are many different URI schemes, each with specific additional rules
       and meanings, but they are intentionally made to be as similar as  possi&#8208;
       ble.   For  example, many URL schemes permit the authority to be the fol&#8208;
       lowing format, called here an  ip_server  (square  brackets  show  what&apos;s
       optional):

       ip_server = [user [ : password ] @ ] host [ : port]

       This format allows you to optionally insert a username, a user plus pass&#8208;
       word, and/or a port number.  The host is the name of the  host  computer,
       either  its name as determined by DNS or an IP address (numbers separated
       by periods).  Thus the URI &lt;http://fred:fredpassword@xyz.com:8080/&gt;  logs
       into a web server on host xyz.com as fred (using fredpassword) using port
       8080.  Avoid including a password in a URI if  possible  because  of  the
       many  security  risks of having a password written down.  If the URL sup&#8208;
       plies a username but no password, and the remote server requests a  pass&#8208;
       word, the program interpreting the URL should request one from the user.

       Here are some of the most common schemes in use on UNIX-like systems that
       are understood by many tools.  Note that many tools using URIs also  have
       internal  schemes  or specialized schemes; see those tools&apos; documentation
       for information on those schemes.

       http - Web (HTTP) server

       http://ip_server/path
       http://ip_server/path?query

       This is a URL accessing a web (HTTP) server.  The default port is 80.  If
       the  path  refers  to  a  directory,  the  web server will choose what to
       return; usually if there is a file named &quot;index.html&quot; or &quot;index.htm&quot;  its
       content is returned, otherwise, a list of the files in the current direc&#8208;
       tory (with appropriate links) is generated and returned.  An  example  is
       &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;.

       A  query  can  be  given in the archaic &quot;isindex&quot; format, consisting of a
       word or phrase and not including an equal sign (=).  A query can also  be
       in  the  longer  &quot;GET&quot; format, which has one or more query entries of the
       form key=value separated by the ampersand character (&amp;).  Note  that  key
       can  be repeated more than once, though it&apos;s up to the web server and its
       application programs to determine if there&apos;s any meaning to that.   There
       is  an  unfortunate interaction with HTML/XML/SGML and the GET query for&#8208;
       mat; when such URIs with more than one key are embedded in SGML/XML docu&#8208;
       ments  (including  HTML), the ampersand (&amp;) has to be rewritten as &amp;amp;.
       Note that not all queries use this format; larger forms may be  too  long
       to  store as a URI, so they use a different interaction mechanism (called
       POST) which does not include the data in the URI.  See the Common Gateway
       Interface specification at &#10216;http://www.w3.org/CGI&#10217; for more information.

       ftp - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

       ftp://ip_server/path

       This  is a URL accessing a file through the file transfer protocol (FTP).
       The default port (for control) is 21.  If no username  is  included,  the
       username  &quot;anonymous&quot;  is supplied, and in that case many clients provide
       as the password the requestor&apos;s Internet email address.   An  example  is
       &lt;ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt&gt;.

       gopher - Gopher server

       gopher://ip_server/gophertype selector
       gopher://ip_server/gophertype selector%09search
       gopher://ip_server/gophertype selector%09search%09gopher+_string

       The default gopher port is 70.  gophertype is a single-character field to
       denote the Gopher type of the resource to  which  the  URL  refers.   The
       entire  path  may also be empty, in which case the delimiting &quot;/&quot; is also
       optional and the gophertype defaults to &quot;1&quot;.

       selector is the Gopher selector string.  In the Gopher  protocol,  Gopher
       selector  strings  are  a sequence of octets which may contain any octets
       except 09 hexadecimal (US-ASCII HT  or  tab),  0A  hexadecimal  (US-ASCII
       character LF), and 0D (US-ASCII character CR).
&#12;       mailto - Email address

       mailto:email-address

       This  is  an  email  address,  usually  of  the  form name@hostname.  See
       mailaddr(7) for more information  on  the  correct  format  of  an  email
       address.  Note that any % character must be rewritten as %25.  An example
       is &lt;mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com&gt;.

       news - Newsgroup or News message

       news:newsgroup-name
       news:message-id

       A  newsgroup-name  is  a  period-delimited  hierarchical  name,  such  as
       &quot;comp.infosystems.www.misc&quot;.    If   &lt;newsgroup-name&gt;   is   &quot;*&quot;  (as  in
       &lt;news:*&gt;), it is used to refer to &quot;all available news groups&quot;.  An  exam&#8208;
       ple is &lt;news:comp.lang.ada&gt;.

       A   message-id   corresponds   to   the   Message-ID  of  IETF  RFC 1036,
       &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1036.txt&#10217; without the enclosing &quot;&lt;&quot; and  &quot;&gt;&quot;;
       it  takes  the form unique@full_domain_name.  A message identifier may be
       distinguished from a news group name by the presence of the  &quot;@&quot;  charac&#8208;
       ter.

       telnet - Telnet login

       telnet://ip_server/

       The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive text services that
       may be accessed by the Telnet protocol.  The final &quot;/&quot; character  may  be
       omitted.     The   default   port   is   23.    An   example   is   &lt;tel&#8208;
       net://melvyl.ucop.edu/&gt;.

       file - Normal file

       file://ip_server/path_segments
       file:path_segments

       This represents a file or directory accessible  locally.   As  a  special
       case,  host  can  be  the string &quot;localhost&quot; or the empty string; this is
       interpreted as &quot;the machine from which the URL is being interpreted&quot;.  If
       the  path  is  to  a directory, the viewer should display the directory&apos;s
       contents with links to each containee; not all viewers currently do this.
       KDE  supports  generated  files  through the URL &lt;file:/cgi-bin&gt;.  If the
       given file isn&apos;t found, browser writers may want to  try  to  expand  the
       filename via filename globbing (see glob(7) and glob(3)).

       The  second  format  (e.g.,  &lt;file:/etc/passwd&gt;)  is a correct format for
       referring to a local file.  However, older standards did not permit  this
       format, and some programs don&apos;t recognize this as a URI.  A more portable
       syntax is to use an  empty  string  as  the  server  name,  for  example,
       &lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;;  this form does the same thing and is easily recog&#8208;
       nized by pattern matchers and older programs as a URI.  Note that if  you
       really  mean  to say &quot;start from the current location,&quot; don&apos;t specify the
       scheme at all; use a relative address like &lt;../test.txt&gt;, which  has  the
       side-effect  of  being  scheme-independent.  An example of this scheme is
       &lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;.

       man - Man page documentation

       man:command-name
       man:command-name(section)

       This refers to local online manual (man) reference  pages.   The  command
       name  can optionally be followed by a parenthesis and section number; see
       man(7) for more information on the meaning of the section numbers.   This
       URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not cur&#8208;
       rently registered by the IETF.  An example is &lt;man:ls(1)&gt;.

       info - Info page documentation

       info:virtual-filename
       info:virtual-filename#nodename
       info:(virtual-filename)
       info:(virtual-filename)nodename

       This scheme refers to online info reference pages (generated from texinfo
       files),  a  documentation  format used by programs such as the GNU tools.
       This URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not
       currently registered by the IETF.  As of this writing, GNOME and KDE dif&#8208;
       fer in their URI syntax and do not accept the other&apos;s syntax.  The  first
       two  formats are the GNOME format; in nodenames all spaces are written as
       underscores.  The second two formats are the KDE format; spaces in  node&#8208;
       names must be written as spaces, even though this is forbidden by the URI
       standards.  It&apos;s hoped that in the future most tools will understand  all
       of  these  formats and will always accept underscores for spaces in node&#8208;
       names.  In both GNOME and KDE, if the form without the nodename  is  used
       the  nodename  is  assumed to be &quot;Top&quot;.  Examples of the GNOME format are
       &lt;info:gcc&gt; and &lt;info:gcc#G++_and_GCC&gt;.  Examples of the  KDE  format  are
       &lt;info:(gcc)&gt; and &lt;info:(gcc)G++ and GCC&gt;.

       whatis - Documentation search

       whatis:string

       This  scheme  searches  the  database of short (one-line) descriptions of
       commands and returns a list of descriptions containing that string.  Only
       complete  word  matches are returned.  See whatis(1).  This URI scheme is
       unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not  currently  regis&#8208;
       tered by the IETF.

       ghelp - GNOME help documentation

       ghelp:name-of-application

       This loads GNOME help for the given application.  Note that not much doc&#8208;
       umentation currently exists in this format.

       ldap - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

       ldap://hostport
       ldap://hostport/
       ldap://hostport/dn
       ldap://hostport/dn?attributes
       ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope
       ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope?filter
       ldap://hostport/dn?attributes?scope?filter?extensions

       This scheme supports queries to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
       (LDAP), a protocol for querying a set of servers for hierarchically orga&#8208;
       nized information (such as people and computing resources).  See RFC 2255
       &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt&#10217;  for  more  information on the LDAP
       URL scheme.  The components of this URL are:

       hostport    the LDAP server to query, written as  a  hostname  optionally
                   followed  by  a  colon and the port number.  The default LDAP
                   port is TCP port 389.  If empty, the client determines  which
                   the LDAP server to use.

       dn          the LDAP Distinguished Name, which identifies the base object
                   of the LDAP  search  (see  RFC 2253  &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc
                   /rfc2253.txt&#10217; section 3).

       attributes  a  comma-separated  list  of  attributes  to be returned; see
                   RFC 2251 section 4.1.5.  If omitted, all attributes should be
                   returned.

       scope       specifies the scope of the search, which can be one of &quot;base&quot;
                   (for a base object search), &quot;one&quot; (for a  one-level  search),
                   or &quot;sub&quot; (for a subtree search).  If scope is omitted, &quot;base&quot;
                   is assumed.

       filter      specifies the search filter (subset of  entries  to  return).
                   If  omitted,  all  entries  should be returned.  See RFC 2254
                   &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt&#10217; section 4.

       extensions  a comma-separated list of type=value pairs, where the  =value
                   portion  may  be  omitted  for  options not requiring it.  An
                   extension prefixed with a &apos;!&apos; is critical (must be  supported
                   to be valid), otherwise it is noncritical (optional).

       LDAP queries are easiest to explain by example.  Here&apos;s a query that asks
       ldap.itd.umich.edu for information about the University  of  Michigan  in
       the U.S.:

       ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US

       To just get its postal address attribute, request:

       ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US?postalAddress

       To ask a host.com at port 6666 for information about the person with com&#8208;
       mon name (cn) &quot;Babs Jensen&quot; at University of Michigan, request:

       ldap://host.com:6666/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)

       wais - Wide Area Information Servers

       wais://hostport/database
       wais://hostport/database?search
       wais://hostport/database/wtype/wpath

       This scheme designates a WAIS database, search,  or  document  (see  IETF
       RFC 1625  &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1625.txt&#10217;  for  more information on
       WAIS).  Hostport is the hostname, optionally followed by a colon and port
       number (the default port number is 210).

       The first form designates a WAIS database for searching.  The second form
       designates a particular search of the WAIS database database.  The  third
       form  designates  a  particular  document  within  a  WAIS database to be
       retrieved.  wtype is the WAIS designation of the type of the  object  and
       wpath is the WAIS document-id.

       other schemes

       There  are many other URI schemes.  Most tools that accept URIs support a
       set of internal URIs (e.g., Mozilla has the about:  scheme  for  internal
       information,  and  the GNOME help browser has the toc: scheme for various
       starting locations).  There are many schemes that have been  defined  but
       are  not  as widely used at the current time (e.g., prospero).  The nntp:
       scheme is deprecated in favor of the news: scheme.  URNs are to  be  sup&#8208;
       ported  by  the  urn:  scheme,  with  a  hierarchical  name  space (e.g.,
       urn:ietf:... would identify IETF documents); at this time  URNs  are  not
       widely implemented.  Not all tools support all schemes.

   Character Encoding
       URIs  use a limited number of characters so that they can be typed in and
       used in a variety of situations.

       The following characters are reserved, that is, they may appear in a  URI
       but their use is limited to their reserved purpose (conflicting data must
       be escaped before forming the URI):

                 ; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,

       Unreserved characters may be included in a  URI.   Unreserved  characters
       include  upper  and  lower  case English letters, decimal digits, and the
       following limited set of punctuation marks and symbols:

               - _ . ! ~ * &apos; ( )

       All other characters must be escaped.  An escaped octet is encoded  as  a
       character  triplet,  consisting  of the percent character &quot;%&quot; followed by
       the two hexadecimal digits representing the octet code (you can use upper
       or  lower case letters for the hexadecimal digits).  For example, a blank
       space must be escaped as &quot;%20&quot;, a tab character as &quot;%09&quot;, and the &quot;&amp;&quot;  as
       &quot;%26&quot;.  Because the percent &quot;%&quot; character always has the reserved purpose
       of being the escape indicator, it must be escaped as &quot;%25&quot;.  It is common
       practice to escape space characters as the plus symbol (+) in query text;
       this practice isn&apos;t uniformly defined in the relevant RFCs (which  recom&#8208;
       mend  %20  instead) but any tool accepting URIs with query text should be
       prepared for them.  A URI is always shown in its &quot;escaped&quot; form.

       Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing  the  semantics  of
       the  URI,  but  this should not be done unless the URI is being used in a
       context that does not allow the unescaped character to appear.  For exam&#8208;
       ple,  &quot;%7e&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;~&quot; in an HTTP URL path, but the
       two are equivalent for an HTTP URL.

       For URIs which must handle characters outside the US ASCII character set,
       the  HTML  4.01  specification  (section  B.2) and IETF RFC 2718 (section
       2.2.5) recommend the following approach:

       1.  translate the character  sequences  into  UTF-8  (IETF  RFC 2279)&#8212;see
           utf-8(7)&#8212;and then

       2.  use  the  URI  escaping  mechanism, that is, use the %HH encoding for
           unsafe octets.

   Writing a URI
       When  written,  URIs  should  be  placed  inside  double  quotes   (e.g.,
       &quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot;),   enclosed   in   angle   brackets  (e.g.,
       &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;), or placed on a line  by  themselves.   A  warning  for
       those  who  use double-quotes: never move extraneous punctuation (such as
       the period ending a sentence or the comma in a list) inside a URI,  since
       this  will  change  the  value  of  the URI.  Instead, use angle brackets
       instead, or switch to a quoting system  that  never  includes  extraneous
       characters  inside quotation marks.  This latter system, called the &apos;new&apos;
       or &apos;logical&apos; quoting system by &quot;Hart&apos;s Rules&quot; and the &quot;Oxford  Dictionary
       for  Writers  and  Editors&quot;,  is  preferred practice in Great Britain and
       hackers worldwide (see the Jargon File&apos;s section on Hacker Writing Style,
       &#10216;http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWritingStyle.html&#10217;,  for  more
       information).  Older documents suggested inserting the prefix &quot;URL:&quot; just
       before the URI, but this form has never caught on.

       The  URI  syntax  was  designed to be unambiguous.  However, as URIs have
       become commonplace, traditional  media  (television,  radio,  newspapers,
       billboards,  etc.) have increasingly used abbreviated URI references con&#8208;
       sisting of only  the  authority  and  path  portions  of  the  identified
       resource  (e.g., &lt;www.w3.org/Addressing&gt;).  Such references are primarily
       intended for human interpretation rather than machine, with  the  assump&#8208;
       tion  that  context-based  heuristics  are sufficient to complete the URI
       (e.g., hostnames beginning with &quot;www&quot; are likely to have a URI prefix  of
       &quot;http://&quot;  and  hostnames beginning with &quot;ftp&quot; likely to have a prefix of
       &quot;ftp://&quot;).  Many client implementations heuristically resolve these  ref&#8208;
       erences.   Such  heuristics  may  change over time, particularly when new
       schemes are introduced.  Since an abbreviated URI has the same syntax  as
       a relative URL path, abbreviated URI references cannot be used where rel&#8208;
       ative URIs are permitted, and can only be used when there is  no  defined
       base  (such as in dialog boxes).  Don&apos;t use abbreviated URIs as hypertext
       links inside a document; use the standard format as described here.

CONFORMING TO
       (IETF   RFC 2396)   &#10216;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt&#10217;,   (HTML   4.0)
       &#10216;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40&#10217;.

NOTES
       Any tool accepting URIs (e.g., a web browser) on a Linux system should be
       able to handle (directly or indirectly)  all  of  the  schemes  described
       here,  including  the  man: and info: schemes.  Handling them by invoking
       some other program is fine and in fact encouraged.

       Technically the fragment isn&apos;t part of the URI.

       For information on how to embed URIs (including URLs) in a  data  format,
       see  documentation  on  that format.  HTML uses the format &lt;A HREF=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;
       text &lt;/A&gt;.  Texinfo files use the format @uref{uri}.  Man and  mdoc  have
       the recently added UR macro, or just include the URI in the text (viewers
       should be able to detect :// as part of a URI).

       The GNOME and KDE desktop environments currently vary in  the  URIs  they
       accept,  in  particular  in  their respective help browsers.  To list man
       pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:man&gt; while KDE uses  &lt;man:(index)&gt;,  and  to  list
       info pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:info&gt; while KDE uses &lt;info:(dir)&gt; (the author
       of this man page prefers the KDE approach here,  though  a  more  regular
       format would be even better).  In general, KDE uses &lt;file:/cgi-bin/&gt; as a
       prefix to a set of generated files.  KDE prefers documentation  in  HTML,
       accessed  via  the  &lt;file:/cgi-bin/helpindex&gt;.   GNOME  prefers the ghelp
       scheme to store and find documentation.  Neither  browser  handles  file:
       references  to  directories at the time of this writing, making it diffi&#8208;
       cult to refer to an entire directory with  a  browsable  URI.   As  noted
       above,  these  environments  differ  in how they handle the info: scheme,
       probably the most important variation.  It is expected that GNOME and KDE
       will  converge  to  common  URI formats, and a future version of this man
       page will describe the converged result.  Efforts to aid this convergence
       are encouraged.

   Security
       A  URI  does  not  in itself pose a security threat.  There is no general
       guarantee that a URL, which at one time located a  given  resource,  will
       continue to do so.  Nor is there any guarantee that a URL will not locate
       a different resource at some later point in time; such  a  guarantee  can
       only  be  obtained  from the person(s) controlling that namespace and the
       resource in question.

       It is sometimes possible to construct a URL such that an attempt to  per&#8208;
       form  a  seemingly harmless operation, such as the retrieval of an entity
       associated with the resource, will in  fact  cause  a  possibly  damaging
       remote  operation  to  occur.  The unsafe URL is typically constructed by
       specifying a port number other than that reserved for the network  proto&#8208;
       col  in question.  The client unwittingly contacts a site that is in fact
       running a different protocol.  The content of the URL  contains  instruc&#8208;
       tions  that,  when interpreted according to this other protocol, cause an
       unexpected operation.  An example has been the use of  a  gopher  URL  to
       cause  an  unintended  or  impersonating  message  to  be sent via a SMTP
       server.

       Caution should be used when using any URL that specifies  a  port  number
       other  than  the default for the protocol, especially when it is a number
       within the reserved space.

       Care should be taken when a URI contains escaped delimiters for  a  given
       protocol  (for  example,  CR and LF characters for telnet protocols) that
       these are not unescaped before transmission.  This might violate the pro&#8208;
       tocol,  but  avoids the potential for such characters to be used to simu&#8208;
       late an extra operation or parameter in that protocol, which  might  lead
       to an unexpected and possibly harmful remote operation to be performed.

       It  is  clearly  unwise  to  use  a URI that contains a password which is
       intended to be secret.  In particular, the use of a password  within  the
       &quot;userinfo&quot;  component  of a URI is strongly recommended against except in
       those rare cases where the &quot;password&quot; parameter is intended to be public.

BUGS
       Documentation may be placed in a variety of locations, so there currently
       isn&apos;t  a  good  URI  scheme for general online documentation in arbitrary
       formats.  References of the form &lt;file:///usr/doc/ZZZ&gt; don&apos;t work because
       different distributions and local installation requirements may place the
       files in different directories (it may be in /usr/doc, or /usr/local/doc,
       or  /usr/share,  or  somewhere  else).   Also,  the directory ZZZ usually
       changes when a version changes (though filename globbing could  partially
       overcome  this).   Finally, using the file: scheme doesn&apos;t easily support
       people who dynamically load documentation from the Internet  (instead  of
       loading  the files onto a local file system).  A future URI scheme may be
       added (e.g., &quot;userdoc:&quot;) to permit programs to  include  cross-references
       to  more detailed documentation without having to know the exact location
       of that documentation.  Alternatively, a future version of the  file-sys&#8208;
       tem  specification  may  specify  file locations sufficiently so that the
       file: scheme will be able to locate documentation.

       Many programs and file formats don&apos;t include  a  way  to  incorporate  or
       implement links using URIs.

       Many  programs  can&apos;t  handle  all  of these different URI formats; there
       should be a standard mechanism to load an arbitrary  URI  that  automati&#8208;
       cally  detects  the  users&apos;  environment (e.g., text or graphics, desktop
       environment, local user preferences, and currently executing  tools)  and
       invokes the right tool for any URI.
