USCAN(1)                                                                USCAN(1)



NAME
       uscan - scan/watch upstream sources for new releases of software

SYNOPSIS
       uscan [options] [path-to-debian-source-packages ...]

DESCRIPTION
       uscan  scans  the given directories (or the current directory if none are
       specified) and all of their subdirectories for packages containing a con&#8208;
       trol  file  debian/watch.   Parameters  are  then read from those control
       files and upstream ftp or http sites are inspected  for  newly  available
       updates  (as compared with the upstream version number retrieved from the
       debian/changelog file in the same directory).   The  newest  updates  are
       retrieved  (as  determined  by their version numbers) and if specified in
       the watch file, a program may then be executed on  the  newly  downloaded
       source.

       The  traditional  debian/watch  files  can still be used, but the current
       format offers both  simpler  and  more  flexible  services.   We  do  not
       describe  the  old  format  here; for their documentation, see the source
       code for uscan.


FORMAT of debian/watch files
       The following demonstrates the type of entries  which  can  appear  in  a
       debian/watch  file.  Obviously, not all of these would appear in one such
       file; usually, one would have one line for the current package.


       # format version number, currently 3; this line is compulsory!
       version=3

       # Line continuations are performed with \

       # This is the format for an FTP site:
       # Full-site-with-pattern  [Version  [Action]]
       ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/web/c_cpp/cweb/cweb-(.+)\.tar\.gz \
         debian  uupdate

       # This is the format for an FTP site with regex special characters in
       # the filename part
       ftp://ftp.worldforge.org/pub/worldforge/libs/Atlas-C++/transitional/Atlas-C\+\+-(.+)\.tar\.gz

       # This is the format for an FTP site with directory pattern matching
       ftp://ftp.nessus.org/pub/nessus/nessus-([\d\.]+)/src/nessus-core-([\d\.]+)\.tar\.gz

       # This can be used if you want to override the PASV setting
       # for a specific site
       # opts=pasv ftp://.../...

       # This is one format for an HTTP site, which is the same
       # as the FTP format.  uscan starts by downloading the homepage,
       # obtained by removing the last component of the URL; in this case,
       # http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Text/
       http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Text/Text-CSV_XS-(.+)\.tar\.gz

       # This is a variant HTTP format which allows direct specification of
       # the homepage:
       # Homepage  Pattern  [Version  [Action]]
       http://www.dataway.ch/~lukasl/amph/amph.html \
         files/amphetamine-([\d\.]*).tar.bz2
&#12;       # This one shows that recursive directory scanning works, in either of
       # two forms, as long as the website can handle requests of the form
       # http://site/inter/mediate/dir/
       http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/(\d\.\d)/ \
         Twisted-([\d\.]*)\.tar\.bz2
       http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/(\d\.\d)/Twisted-([\d\.]*)\.tar\.bz2

       # qa.debian.org runs a redirector which allows a simpler form of URL
       # for SourceForge based projects. The format below will automatically
       # be rewritten to use the redirector.
       http://sf.net/audacity/audacity-src-(.+)\.tar\.gz

       # githubredir.debian.net is a redirector for GitHub projects
       # It can be used as following:
       http://githubredir.debian.net/github/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt; (.+).tar.gz

       # This is the format for a site which has funny version numbers;
       # the parenthesised groups will be joined with dots to make a
       # sanitised version number
       http://www.site.com/pub/foobar/foobar_v(\d+)_(\d+)\.tar\.gz

       # This is another way of handling site with funny version numbers,
       # this time using mangling.  (Note that multiple groups will be
       # concatenated before mangling is performed, and that mangling will
       # only be performed on the basename version number, not any path
       # version numbers.)
       opts=&quot;uversionmangle=s/^/0.0./&quot; \
         ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/wine/development/Wine-(.+)\.tar\.gz

       # Similarly, the upstream part of the Debian version number can be
       # mangled:
       opts=dversionmangle=s/\.dfsg\.\d+$// \
         http://some.site.org/some/path/foobar-(.+)\.tar\.gz

       # The filename is found by taking the last component of the URL and
       # removing everything after any &apos;?&apos;.  If this would not make a usable
       # filename, use filenamemangle.  For example,
       # &lt;A href=&quot;http://foo.bar.org/download/?path=&amp;download=foo-0.1.1.tar.gz&quot;&gt;
       # could be handled as:
       # opts=filenamemangle=s/.*=(.*)/$1/ \
       #     http://foo.bar.org/download/\?path=&amp;download=foo-(.+)\.tar\.gz
       #
       # &lt;A href=&quot;http://foo.bar.org/download/?path=&amp;download_version=0.1.1&quot;&gt;
       # could be handled as:
       # opts=filenamemangle=s/.*=(.*)/foo-$1\.tar\.gz/ \
       #    http://foo.bar.org/download/\?path=&amp;download_version=(.+)

       # The option downloadurlmangle can be used to mangle the URL of the file
       # to download.  This can only be used with http:// URLs.  This may be
       # necessary if the link given on the web page needs to be transformed in
       # some way into one which will work automatically, for example:
       # opts=downloadurlmangle=s/prdownload/download/ \
       #   http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2051 \
       #   http://prdownload.berlios.de/softdevice/vdr-softdevice-(.+).tgz


       Comment lines may be introduced with a `#&apos; character.  Continuation lines
       may be indicated by terminating a line with a backslash character.

       The  first  (non-comment)  line of the file must begin `version=3&apos;.  This
       allows for future extensions without having to change  the  name  of  the
       file.

       There  are  two  possibilities for the syntax of an HTTP watch file line,
       and only one for an FTP line.  We begin with  the  common  (and  simpler)
       format.   We describe the optional opts=... first field below, and ignore
       it in what follows.

       The first field gives the full pattern of URLs being  searched  for.   In
       the  case  of an FTP site, the directory listing for the requested direc&#8208;
       tory will be requested and this will be scanned for  files  matching  the
       basename  (everything  after  the  trailing `/&apos;).  In the case of an HTTP
       site, the URL obtained by stripping everything after the  trailing  slash
       will  be  downloaded  and  searched  for  hrefs  (links  of  the  form &lt;a
       href=...&gt;) to either the full URL pattern given, or to the absolute  part
       (everything without the http://host.name/ part), or to the basename (just
       the part after the final `/&apos;).  Everything up to the final slash is taken
       as  a  verbatim URL, as long as there are no parentheses (`(&apos; and &apos;)&apos;) in
       this part of the URL: if it does, the directory name will be  matched  in
       the same way as the final component of the URL as described below.  (Note
       that regex metacharacters such as `+&apos; are regarded literally unless  they
       are in a path component containing parentheses; see the Atlas-C++ example
       above.  Also, the parentheses must match within each path component.)

       The pattern (after the final slash) is a Perl regexp (see  perlre(1)  for
       details of these).  You need to make the pattern so tight that it matches
       only the upstream software you are interested in and nothing else.  Also,
       the  pattern will be anchored at the beginning and at the end, so it must
       match the full filename.  (Note that for HTTP URLs, the href may  include
       the absolute path or full site and path and still be accepted.)  The pat&#8208;
       tern must contain at least one Perl group as explained in the next  para&#8208;
       graph.

       Having  got a list of `files&apos; matching the pattern, their version numbers
       are extracted by treating the  part  matching  the  Perl  regexp  groups,
       demarcated  by  `(...)&apos;,  joining them with `.&apos; as a separator, and using
       the result as the version number of the file.  The  version  number  will
       then be mangled if required by the uversionmangle option described below.
       Finally, the file versions are then compared to find  the  one  with  the
       greatest  version number, as determined by dpkg --compare-versions.  Note
       that if you need Perl groups which are not to be used in the version num&#8208;
       ber,  either  use  `(?:...)&apos; or use the uversionmangle option to clean up
       the mess!

       The current (upstream) version can be specified as the  second  parameter
       in  the  watch  file line.  If this is debian or absent, then the current
       Debian version (as determined by debian/changelog) is used  to  determine
       the  current  upstream version.  The current upstream version may also be
       specified by the command-line option --upstream-version, which  specifies
       the upstream version number of the currently installed package (i.e., the
       Debian version number without epoch and Debian revision).   The  upstream
       version  number  will  then be mangled using the dversionmangle option if
       one is specified, as described below.  If the newest version available is
       newer  than  the  current  version, then it is downloaded into the parent
       directory, unless the --report or --report-status option has  been  used.
       Once  the  file  has  been downloaded, then a symlink to the file is made
       from &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.{gz|bz2|lzma|xz} as  described  by  the
       help for the --symlink option.

       Finally,  if  a  third  parameter  (an action) is given in the watch file
       line, this is taken as the name of a command, and the command
           command --upstream-version version filename
       is executed, using either the original file or the symlink name.  A  com&#8208;
       mon  such command would be uupdate(1).  (Note that the calling syntax was
       slightly different when using watch file without  a  `version=...&apos;  line;
       there  the command executed was `command filename version&apos;.)  If the com&#8208;
       mand is uupdate, then the --no-symlink option is given to  uupdate  as  a
       first  option,  since  any  requested  symlinking will already be done by
       uscan.

       The alternative version of the watch file syntax for HTTP URLs is as fol&#8208;
       lows.   The first field is a homepage which should be downloaded and then
       searched for hrefs matching  the  pattern  given  in  the  second  field.
       (Again, this pattern will be anchored at the beginning and the end, so it
       must match the whole href.  If you want to match just the basename of the
       href, you can use a pattern like &quot;.*/name-(.+)\.tar\.gz&quot; if you know that
       there is a full URL, or  better  still:  &quot;(?:.*/)?name-(.+)\.tar\.gz&quot;  if
       there may or may not be.  Note the use of (?:...) to avoid making a back&#8208;
       reference.)  If any  of  the  hrefs  in  the  homepage  which  match  the
       (anchored)  pattern  are relative URLs, they will be taken as being rela&#8208;
       tive to the base URL of the homepage (i.e.,  with  everything  after  the
       trailing  slash  removed),  or  relative to the base URL specified in the
       homepage itself with a &lt;base  href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;  tag.   The  third  and  fourth
       fields are the version number and action fields as before.

PER-SITE OPTIONS
       A watch file line may be prefixed with `opts=options&apos;, where options is a
       comma-separated list  of  options.   The  whole  options  string  may  be
       enclosed  in  double  quotes,  which is necessary if options contains any
       spaces.  The recognised options are as follows:

       active and passive (or pasv)
              If used on an FTP line, these override the choice  of  whether  to
              use  PASV mode or not, and force the use of the specified mode for
              this site.

       uversionmangle=rules
              This is used to mangle the upstream version number as  matched  by
              the  ftp://...  or  http://  rules  as  follows.  First, the rules
              string is split into  multiple  rules  at  every  `;&apos;.   Then  the
              upstream  version  number  is mangled by applying rule to the ver&#8208;
              sion, in a similar way to executing the Perl command:
                  $version =~ rule;
              for each rule.  Thus, suitable rules might be `s/^/0./&apos; to prepend
              `0.&apos;  to  the  version  number and `s/_/./g&apos; to change underscores
              into periods.  Note that the rules string may not contain  commas;
              this should not be a problem.

              rule  may only use the &apos;s&apos;, &apos;tr&apos; and &apos;y&apos; operations.  When the &apos;s&apos;
              operation is used, only the &apos;g&apos;, &apos;i&apos; and &apos;x&apos; flags  are  available
              and  rule may not contain any expressions which have the potential
              to execute code (i.e. the (?{}) and (??{}) constructs are not sup&#8208;
              ported).

              If the &apos;s&apos; operation is used, the replacement can contain backref&#8208;
              erences to expressions within parenthesis in the matching  regexp,
              like `s/-alpha(\d*)/.a$1/&apos;. These backreferences must use the `$1&apos;
              syntax, as the `\1&apos; syntax is not supported.

       dversionmangle=rules
              This is used to mangle the Debian version number of the  currently
              installed  package  in  the same way as the uversionmangle option.
              Thus, a suitable rule might  be  `s/\.dfsg\.\d+$//&apos;  to  remove  a
              `.dfsg.1&apos;  suffix  from  the  Debian  version number, or to handle
              `.pre6&apos; type version numbers.  Again, the  rules  string  may  not
              contain commas; this should not be a problem.

       versionmangle=rules
              This  is  a syntactic shorthand for uversionmangle=rules,dversion&#8208;
              mangle=rules, applying the same rules to  both  the  upstream  and
              Debian version numbers.

       filenamemangle=rules
              This is used to mangle the filename with which the downloaded file
              will be saved, and is parsed in the same way as the uversionmangle
              option.   Examples  of  its  use are given in the examples section
              above.
&#12;       downloadurlmangle=rules
              This is used to mangle the URL to be used for the  download.   The
              URL  is  first  computed  based on the homepage downloaded and the
              pattern matched, then the version number is determined  from  this
              URL.   Finally,  any rules given by this option are applied before
              the actual download attempt is made. An  example  of  its  use  is
              given in the examples section above.

Directory name checking
       Similarly  to  several  other  scripts  in  the devscripts package, uscan
       explores the requested directory trees looking for  debian/changelog  and
       debian/watch files.  As a safeguard against stray files causing potential
       problems, and in order to promote efficiency, it will examine the name of
       the  parent  directory once it finds the debian/changelog file, and check
       that the directory name corresponds to the package name.   It  will  only
       attempt  to  download  newer versions of the package and then perform any
       requested action if the directory name matches the  package  name.   Pre&#8208;
       cisely how it does this is controlled by two configuration file variables
       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL  and  DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX,  and
       their   corresponding   command-line  options  --check-dirname-level  and
       --check-dirname-regex.

       DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL can take the following values:

       0      Never check the directory name.

       1      Only check the directory name if we have had to  change  directory
              in  our  search  for debian/changelog, that is, the directory con&#8208;
              taining debian/changelog is not the directory from which uscan was
              invoked.  This is the default behaviour.

       2      Always check the directory name.

       The  directory  name  is checked by testing whether the current directory
       name (as determined by pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the  configura&#8208;
       tion  file  option  DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line
       option --check-dirname-regex regex.  Here regex  is  a  Perl  regex  (see
       perlre(3perl)),  which will be anchored at the beginning and the end.  If
       regex contains a &apos;/&apos;, then it must match the  full  directory  path.   If
       not,  then  it must match the full directory name.  If regex contains the
       string &#180;PACKAGE&apos;, this will be replaced by the source  package  name,  as
       determined  from  the  changelog.   The  default  value for the regex is:
       &#180;PACKAGE(-.+)?&apos;, thus matching directory names such as PACKAGE and  PACK&#8208;
       AGE-version.

EXAMPLE
       This script will perform a fully automatic upstream update.

       #!/bin/sh -e
       # called with &apos;--upstream-version&apos; &lt;version&gt; &lt;file&gt;
       uupdate &quot;$@&quot;
       package=`dpkg-parsechangelog | sed -n &apos;s/^Source: //p&apos;`
       cd ../$package-$2
       debuild

       Note  that we don&apos;t call dupload or dput automatically, as the maintainer
       should perform sanity checks on  the  software  before  uploading  it  to
       Debian.

OPTIONS
       --report, --no-download
              Only  report  about  available  newer versions but do not download
              anything.

       --report-status
              Report on the status of all packages, even those which are  up-to-
              date, but do not download anything.

       --download
              Report and download.  (This is the default behaviour.)

       --destdir
              Path  of directory to which to download.  If the specified path is
              not absolute, it will be relative to one of the current  directory
              or,  if directory scanning is enabled, the package&apos;s source direc&#8208;
              tory.

       --force-download
              Download upstream even if up to date  (will  not  overwrite  local
              files, however)

       --pasv Force PASV mode for FTP connections.

       --no-pasv
              Do not use PASV mode for FTP connections.

       --timeout N
              Set timeout to N seconds (default 20 seconds).

       --symlink
              Make  orig.tar.gz symlinks to any downloaded files if their exten&#8208;
              sions are .tar.gz or .tgz.  This is also handled for  orig.tar.bz2
              (for  upstream  .tar.bz2,  .tbz,  and  .tbz2),  orig.tar.lzma (for
              upstream .tar.lzma, .tlz, .tlzm, and .tlzma), and orig.tar.xz (for
              upstream .tar.xz and .txz).  (This is the default behaviour.)

       --rename
              Instead of symlinking, rename the downloaded files to their Debian
              orig.tar.gz, orig.tar.bz2, orig.tar.lzma, or orig.tar.xz names  as
              described above.

       --repack
              After  having  downloaded an lzma tar, xz tar, bzip tar or zip ar&#8208;
              chive, repack it to a gzip tar archive, which is  still  currently
              required  as  a member of a Debian source package. Does nothing if
              the downloaded archive is not an lzma tar archive, xz tar archive,
              bzip  tar  archive or a zip archive (i.e. it doesn&apos;t match a .tlz,
              .tlzm, .tlzma, .tar.lzma, .txz, .tar.xz, .tbz, .tbz2, .tar.bz2  or
              .zip  extension).  The unzip package must be installed in order to
              repack .zip archives, the xz-utils package must  be  installed  to
              repack lzma or xz tar archives.

       --no-symlink
              Don&apos;t make these symlinks and don&apos;t rename the files.

       --dehs Use an XML format for output, as required by the DEHS system.

       --no-dehs
              Use the traditional uscan output format.  (This is the default be&#8208;
              haviour.)

       --package package
              Specify the name of the package to check for rather than examining
              debian/changelog;  this  requires the --upstream-version (unless a
              version is specified in the watch file) and --watchfile options as
              well.  Furthermore, no directory scanning will be done and nothing
              will be downloaded.  This option is probably most useful  in  con&#8208;
              junction with the DEHS system (and --dehs).

       --upstream-version upstream-version
              Specify the current upstream version rather than examine the watch
              file or changelog to determine it.  This is ignored if a directory
              scan is being performed and more than one watch file is found.
&#12;       --watchfile watchfile
              Specify  the  watchfile  rather  than  perform a directory scan to
              determine it.  If this option  is  used  without  --package,  then
              uscan  must  be  called from within the Debian package source tree
              (so that debian/changelog can  be  found  simply  by  stepping  up
              through the tree).

       --download-version version
              Specify the version which the upstream release must match in order
              to be considered, rather than using the release with  the  highest
              version.

       --download-current-version
              Download the currently packaged version

       --verbose
              Give verbose output.

       --no-verbose
              Don&apos;t give verbose output.  (This is the default behaviour.)

       --debug
              Dump  the  downloaded web pages to stdout for debugging your watch
              file.

       --check-dirname-level N
              See the above section Directory name checking for  an  explanation
              of this option.

       --check-dirname-regex regex
              See  the  above section Directory name checking for an explanation
              of this option.

       --user-agent, --useragent
              Override the default user agent header.

       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
              first option given on the command-line.

       --help Give brief usage information.

       --version
              Display version information.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The  two  configuration  files /etc/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
       sourced by a shell in that order to set configuration  variables.   These
       may be overridden by command line options.  Environment variable settings
       are ignored for this purpose.  If the first command line option given  is
       --noconf,  then  these  files will not be read.  The currently recognised
       variables are:

       USCAN_DOWNLOAD
              If this is set to no, then newer upstream files will not be  down&#8208;
              loaded;  this  is  equivalent  to  the  --report  or --no-download
              options.

       USCAN_PASV
              If this is set to yes or no, this will force  FTP  connections  to
              use PASV mode or not to, respectively.  If this is set to default,
              then Net::FTP(3) make the choice (primarily based on the  FTP_PAS&#8208;
              SIVE environment variable).

       USCAN_TIMEOUT
              If  set to a number N, then set the timeout to N seconds.  This is
              equivalent to the --timeout option.

       USCAN_SYMLINK
              If this is set to no, then a pkg_version.orig.tar.{gz|bz2|lzma|xz}
              symlink  will not be made (equivalent to the --no-symlink option).
              If it is set to yes or symlink, then the symlinks  will  be  made.
              If  it is set to rename, then the files are renamed (equivalent to
              the --rename option).

       USCAN_DEHS_OUTPUT
              If this is set to yes, then DEHS-style output will be used.   This
              is equivalent to the --dehs option.

       USCAN_VERBOSE
              If this is set to yes, then verbose output will be given.  This is
              equivalent to the --verbose option.

       USCAN_USER_AGENT
              If set, the specified user agent string will be used in  place  of
              the default.  This is equivalent to the --user-agent option.

       USCAN_DESTDIR
              If  set,  the  downloaded  files will be placed in this directory.
              This is equivalent to the --destdir option.

       USCAN_REPACK
              If this is set to yes, then after having downloaded  a  bzip  tar,
              lzma  tar,  xz tar, or zip archive, uscan will repack it to a gzip
              tar.  This is equivalent to the --repack option.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status gives some indication of  whether  a  newer  version  was
       found or not; one is advised to read the output to determine exactly what
       happened and whether there were any warnings to be noted.

       0      Either --help or --version was used, or for some watch file  which
              was examined, a newer upstream version was located.

       1      No newer upstream versions were located for any of the watch files
              examined.

HISTORY AND UPGRADING
       This section briefly describes the backwards-incompatible watch file fea&#8208;
       tures  which  have  been  added in each watch file version, and the first
       version of the devscripts package which understood them.

       Pre-version 2
              The watch file syntax was significantly different in  those  days.
              Don&apos;t  use  it.   If  you are upgrading from a pre-version 2 watch
              file, you are advised to read  this  manpage  and  to  start  from
              scratch.

       Version 2
              devscripts  version  2.6.90:  The first incarnation of the current
              style of watch files.

       Version 3
              devscripts version 2.8.12: Introduced the following: correct  han&#8208;
              dling of regex special characters in the path part, directory/path
              pattern matching, version number in several parts, version  number
              mangling.  Later versions have also introduced URL mangling.

              If you are upgrading from version 2, the key incompatibility is if
              you have multiple groups in the pattern  part;  whereas  only  the
              first  one  would  be  used in version 2, they will all be used in
              version 3.  To avoid this behaviour, change the non-version-number
              groups to be (?:...) instead of a plain (...) group.
