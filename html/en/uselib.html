USELIB(2)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  USELIB(2)



NAME
       uselib - load shared library

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int uselib(const char *library);

DESCRIPTION
       The  system  call  uselib() serves to load a shared library to be used by
       the calling process.  It is given a pathname.  The address where to  load
       is  found  in  the  library  itself.  The library can have any recognized
       binary format.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       In  addition  to  all of the error codes returned by open(2) and mmap(2),
       the following may also be returned:

       EACCES The library specified by library does not  have  read  or  execute
              permission,  or the caller does not have search permission for one
              of the directories in the path  prefix.   (See  also  path_resolu&#8208;
              tion(7).)

       ENFILE The  system  limit  on  the  total  number  of open files has been
              reached.

       ENOEXEC
              The file specified by library is not an executable of known  type,
              e.g., does not have the correct magic numbers.

CONFORMING TO
       uselib()  is  Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs intended
       to be portable.

NOTES
       uselib() was used by early libc startup code to load the shared libraries
       with names found in an array of names in the binary.

       Since  libc  4.3.2,  startup  code  tries  to  prefix  these  names  with
       &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and &quot;&quot; before giving up.   In  libc  4.3.4  and  later
       these  names  are looked for in the directories found in LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
       and if not found there, prefixes &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are tried.

       From libc 4.4.4 on only the library &quot;/lib/ld.so&quot; is loaded, so that  this
       dynamic library can load the remaining libraries needed (again using this
       call).  This is also the state of affairs in libc5.

       glibc2 does not use this call.
