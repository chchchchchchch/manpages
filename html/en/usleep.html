USLEEP(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  USLEEP(3)



NAME
       usleep - suspend execution for microsecond intervals

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int usleep(useconds_t usec);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       usleep():
           Since glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
                       _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED) &amp;&amp;
                   !(_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700)
           Before glibc 2.12:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

DESCRIPTION
       The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling  thread  for  (at
       least)  usec  microseconds.   The sleep may be lengthened slightly by any
       system activity or by the time spent processing the call or by the granu&#8208;
       larity of system timers.

RETURN VALUE
       0 on success, -1 on error.

ERRORS
       EINTR  Interrupted by a signal; see signal(7).

       EINVAL usec  is not smaller than 1000000.  (On systems where that is con&#8208;
              sidered an error.)

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2001 declares this function obsolete;  use
       nanosleep(2)   instead.    POSIX.1-2008   removes  the  specification  of
       usleep().

       On the original BSD implementation, and in glibc  before  version  2.2.2,
       the return type of this function is void.  The POSIX version returns int,
       and this is also the prototype used since glibc 2.2.2.

       Only the EINVAL error return is documented by SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The type useconds_t is an unsigned integer type capable of holding  inte&#8208;
       gers  in  the  range [0,1000000].  Programs will be more portable if they
       never mention this type explicitly.  Use

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           ...
               unsigned int usecs;
           ...
               usleep(usecs);

       The interaction of this function with the SIGALRM signal, and with  other
       timer  functions  such as alarm(2), sleep(3), nanosleep(2), setitimer(2),
       timer_create(2), timer_delete(2), timer_getoverrun(2),  timer_gettime(2),
       timer_settime(2), ualarm(3) is unspecified.

       ualarm(3), time(7)
