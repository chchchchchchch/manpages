UUPDATE(1)                                                            UUPDATE(1)



NAME
       uupdate - upgrade a source code package from an upstream revision

SYNOPSIS
       uupdate [options] new_upstream_archive [version]
       uupdate [options] --patch|-p patch_file

DESCRIPTION
       uupdate  modifies  an  existing  Debian source code archive to reflect an
       upstream update supplied as a patch or from a wholly new source code  ar&#8208;
       chive.  The utility needs to be invoked from the top directory of the old
       source code directory, and if a relative name is given for  the  new  ar&#8208;
       chive  or  patch file, it will be looked for first relative to the execu&#8208;
       tion directory and then relative to the parent of the source tree.   (For
       example,         if         the         changelog         file         is
       /usr/local/src/foo/foo-1.1/debian/changelog, then the  archive  or  patch
       file  will  be looked for relative to /usr/local/src/foo.)  Note that the
       patch file or archive cannot be within the source tree itself.  The  full
       details of what the code does are given below.

       Currently supported source code file types are .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z,
       .tgz, .tar, .tar.lzma, .tar.xz, .7z and .zip  archives.   Also  supported
       are  already  unpacked  source code archives; simply give the path of the
       source code directory.  Supported patch file types  are  gzip-compressed,
       bzip2-compressed,  lzma-compressed,  xz-compressed and uncompressed patch
       files.  The file types are identified by the file names, so they must use
       the standard suffixes.

       Usually uupdate will be able to deduce the version number from the source
       archive name (as long as it only contains digits and periods).   If  that
       fails,  you  need  to  specify the version number explicitly (without the
       Debian release number which will always be initially &#8220;1&#8221;,  or  &#8220;0ubuntu1&#8221;
       on   Ubuntu-detected   systems).   This  can  be  done  with  an  initial
       --upstream-version or -v option, or in the case of  an  archive,  with  a
       version number after the filename.  (The reason for the latter is so that
       uupdate can be called directly from uscan.)

       Since uupdate uses debuild to clean the current archive before trying  to
       apply a patch file, it accepts a --rootcmd or -r option allowing the user
       to specify a gain-root command to be used.  The default is to  use  fake&#8208;
       root.

       If an archive is being built, the pristine upstream source should be used
       to create the .orig.tar.gz file wherever possible.  This means  that  MD5
       sums  or other similar methods can be used to easily compare the upstream
       source to Debian&apos;s copy of the upstream version.  This is the default be&#8208;
       haviour, and can be switched off using the --no-pristine option below.

OPTIONS
       This is a summary of what was explained above.

       --upstream-version version, -v version
              Specify the version number of the upstream package explicitly.

       --rootcmd gain-root-command, -r gain-root-command
              Specify the command to be used to become root to build the package
              and is passed onto debuild(1) if it is specified.

       --pristine, -u
              Treat the source as pristine upstream source  and  symlink  to  it
              from   &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz  whenever  possible.   This
              option has no meaning for patches.  This is the default behaviour.

       --no-pristine
              Do not attempt to make a &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz symlink.

       --symlink, -s
              Simply create a symlink when moving a new upstream .tar.gz archive
              to  the new &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz location.  This is the
              default behaviour.

       --no-symlink
              Copy the upstream .tar.gz to the new location instead of making  a
              symlink.

       --no-conf, --noconf
              Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
              first option given on the command-line.

       --help, -h
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf  and  ~/.devscripts  are
       sourced  in  that  order  to  set  configuration variables.  Command line
       options can be used to override configuration file settings.  Environment
       variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised
       variables are:

       UUPDATE_PRISTINE
              If this is set to no, then it is the  same  as  the  --no-pristine
              command line parameter being used.

       UUPDATE_SYMLINK_ORIG
              If this is set to no, then it is the same as the --no-symlink com&#8208;
              mand line parameter being used.

       UUPDATE_ROOTCMD
              This is equivalent to the --rootcmd option.

ACTIONS TAKEN ON AN ARCHIVE
       Figure out new version number
              Unless an explicit version number is provided, the archive name is
              analyzed for a sequence of digits separated by dots.  If something
              like that is found, it is taken to be  the  new  upstream  version
              number.  If not, processing is aborted.

       Create the .orig.tar.gz archive
              If  the  --pristine or -u option is specified and the upstream ar&#8208;
              chive is a .tar.gz or .tgz  archive,  then  this  will  be  copied
              directly to &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz.

       Unpacking
              The archive is unpacked and placed in a directory with the correct
              name according to  Debian  policy:  package-upstream_version.orig.
              Processing is aborted if this directory already exists.

       Patching
              The  .diffs.gz from the current version are applied to the unpack&#8208;
              aged archive.  A non-zero exit status  and  warning  message  will
              occur if the patches did not apply cleanly or if no patch file was
              found.  Also, the list of rejected patches  will  be  shown.   The
              file  debian/rules  is  made executable and all of the .orig files
              created by patch are deleted.
&#12;       Changelog update
              A changelog entry with the new version number  is  generated  with
              the text &#8220;New upstream release&#8221;.

              When  used on Ubuntu systems, dpkg-vendor detection is used to set
              the   Debian   revision   to   &#8220;0ubuntu1&#8221;.    You    may    change
              debian/changelog manually afterwards.

ACTIONS TAKEN ON A PATCH FILE
       Figure out new version number
              Unless an explicit version number is provided, the patch file name
              is analyzed for a sequence of digits separated by dots.  If  some&#8208;
              thing  like that is found, it is taken to be the new upstream ver&#8208;
              sion number.  If not, processing is aborted.

       Clean the current source tree
              The command debuild clean is executed within  the  current  Debian
              source  archive  to clean it.  If a -r option is given to uupdate,
              it is passed on to debuild.

       Patching
              The current source archive  (.orig.tar.gz)  is  unpacked  and  the
              patch  applied  to  the  original sources.  If this is successful,
              then the .orig directory is renamed to  reflect  the  new  version
              number  and  the  current  Debian  source directory is copied to a
              directory with the new version  number,  otherwise  processing  is
              aborted.   The patch is then applied to the new copy of the Debian
              source directory.  The file debian/rules is  made  executable  and
              all of the .orig files created by patch are deleted.  If there was
              a problem with the patching, a warning is issued and  the  program
              will eventually exit with non-zero exit status.

       Changelog update
              A  changelog  entry  with the new version number is generated with
              the text &#8220;New upstream release&#8221;.

              When used on Ubuntu systems, dpkg-vendor detection is used to  set
              the    Debian    revision   to   &#8220;0ubuntu1&#8221;.    You   may   change
              debian/changelog manually afterwards.
