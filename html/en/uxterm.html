uxterm(1)                                                              uxterm(1)



NAME
       uxterm - X terminal emulator for Unicode (UTF-8) environments

SYNOPSIS
       uxterm [ xterm-options ]

DESCRIPTION
       uxterm  is  a wrapper around the xterm(1) program that invokes the latter
       program with the &#8216;UXTerm&#8217; X resource class set.  All arguments to  uxterm
       are passed to xterm without processing; the -class and -u8 options should
       not be specified because they are used by the  wrapper.   See  the  xterm
       manual page for more information on xterm-options.

       The  environment&apos;s  locale settings (see &#8220;ENVIRONMENT&#8221; below) are used to
       discern the locale&apos;s character set.  If no current locale can  be  deter&#8208;
       mined,  the locale &#8216;en_US&#8217; (the English language as used in the territory
       of the United States) is assumed.   The  locale(1)  utility  is  used  to
       determine  whether  the  system supports the selected locale.  If it does
       not, uxterm will exit with an error and report the output of locale.

       Note: uxterm may produce unexpected results if the current locale is  set
       to  one  in  which  the  UTF-8 character encoding is not supported, or if
       fonts using the ISO 10646-1 character set  are  not  available.   In  the
       Debian  system,  the &#8216;xfonts-base&#8217; package provides the fonts that uxterm
       uses by default.  To change the fonts uxterm uses, edit the /etc/X11/app-
       defaults/UXTerm file.

       A similar wrapper, koi8rxterm(1), is available for KOI8-R environments.

ENVIRONMENT
       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
              The  values of these variables are checked, in order, to determine
              the character set used by the current locale.
