STDARG(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  STDARG(3)



NAME
       stdarg, va_start, va_arg, va_end, va_copy - variable argument lists

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

       void va_start(va_list ap, last);
       type va_arg(va_list ap, type);
       void va_end(va_list ap);
       void va_copy(va_list dest, va_list src);

DESCRIPTION
       A  function  may  be called with a varying number of arguments of varying
       types.  The include file &lt;stdarg.h&gt; declares a type va_list  and  defines
       three  macros  for  stepping through a list of arguments whose number and
       types are not known to the called function.

       The called function must declare an object of type va_list which is  used
       by the macros va_start(), va_arg(), and va_end().

   va_start()
       The  va_start()  macro  initializes ap for subsequent use by va_arg() and
       va_end(), and must be called first.

       The argument last is the name of the last argument  before  the  variable
       argument  list,  that is, the last argument of which the calling function
       knows the type.

       Because the address of this argument may be used in the va_start() macro,
       it  should not be declared as a register variable, or as a function or an
       array type.

   va_arg()
       The va_arg() macro expands to an expression that has the type  and  value
       of the next argument in the call.  The argument ap is the va_list ap ini&#8208;
       tialized by va_start().  Each call to va_arg() modifies ap  so  that  the
       next  call  returns  the next argument.  The argument type is a type name
       specified so that the type of a pointer to an object that has the  speci&#8208;
       fied type can be obtained simply by adding a * to type.

       The  first  use  of the va_arg() macro after that of the va_start() macro
       returns the argument after last.  Successive invocations return the  val&#8208;
       ues of the remaining arguments.

       If  there is no next argument, or if type is not compatible with the type
       of the actual next argument (as promoted according to the  default  argu&#8208;
       ment promotions), random errors will occur.

       If ap is passed to a function that uses va_arg(ap,type) then the value of
       ap is undefined after the return of that function.

   va_end()
       Each invocation of va_start() must be matched by a corresponding  invoca&#8208;
       tion  of  va_end()  in  the same function.  After the call va_end(ap) the
       variable ap is undefined.  Multiple traversals of the list,  each  brack&#8208;
       eted by va_start() and va_end() are possible.  va_end() may be a macro or
       a function.

   va_copy()
       An obvious implementation would have a va_list be a pointer to the  stack
       frame of the variadic function.  In such a setup (by far the most common)
       there seems nothing against an assignment

           va_list aq = ap;

       Unfortunately, there are also systems that make it an array  of  pointers
       (of length 1), and there one needs

           va_list aq;
           *aq = *ap;

       Finally,  on  systems  where arguments are passed in registers, it may be
       necessary for va_start() to allocate memory, store the  arguments  there,
       and  also  an  indication of which argument is next, so that va_arg() can
       step through the list.  Now va_end() can free the allocated memory again.
       To  accommodate  this  situation, C99 adds a macro va_copy(), so that the
       above assignment can be replaced by

           va_list aq;
           va_copy(aq, ap);
           ...
           va_end(aq);

       Each invocation of va_copy() must be matched by a  corresponding  invoca&#8208;
       tion  of  va_end() in the same function.  Some systems that do not supply
       va_copy() have __va_copy instead, since that was the  name  used  in  the
       draft proposal.

CONFORMING TO
       The  va_start(),  va_arg(),  and  va_end()  macros  conform  to C89.  C99
       defines the va_copy() macro.

NOTES
       These macros are not compatible with the historic macros they replace.  A
       backward-compatible version can be found in the include file &lt;varargs.h&gt;.

       The historic setup is:

           #include &lt;varargs.h&gt;

           void
           foo(va_alist)
               va_dcl
           {
               va_list ap;

               va_start(ap);
               while (...) {
                   ...
                   x = va_arg(ap, type);
                   ...
               }
               va_end(ap);
           }

       On  some  systems,  va_end  contains  a  closing  &apos;}&apos;  matching  a &apos;{&apos; in
       va_start, so that both macros must occur in the same function, and  in  a
       way that allows this.

BUGS
       Unlike the varargs macros, the stdarg macros do not permit programmers to
       code a function with no fixed arguments.   This  problem  generates  work
       mainly  when  converting varargs code to stdarg code, but it also creates
       difficulties for variadic functions that wish to pass all of their  argu&#8208;
       ments   on  to  a  function  that  takes  a  va_list  argument,  such  as
       vfprintf(3).

EXAMPLE
       The function foo takes a string of format characters and prints  out  the
       argument associated with each format character based on the type.

       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

       void
       foo(char *fmt, ...)
       {
           va_list ap;
           int d;
           char c, *s;

           va_start(ap, fmt);
           while (*fmt)
               switch (*fmt++) {
               case &apos;s&apos;:              /* string */
                   s = va_arg(ap, char *);
                   printf(&quot;string %s\n&quot;, s);
                   break;
               case &apos;d&apos;:              /* int */
                   d = va_arg(ap, int);
                   printf(&quot;int %d\n&quot;, d);
                   break;
               case &apos;c&apos;:              /* char */
                   /* need a cast here since va_arg only
                      takes fully promoted types */
                   c = (char) va_arg(ap, int);
                   printf(&quot;char %c\n&quot;, c);
                   break;
               }
           va_end(ap);
       }
