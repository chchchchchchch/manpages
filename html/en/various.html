Function Documentation
   __extern ssize_t caca_import_canvas_from_memory (caca_canvas_t *cv, void
       const *data, size_tlen, char const *format) Import a memory buffer into
       the given libcaca canvas&apos;s current frame. The current frame is resized
       accordingly and its contents are replaced with the imported data.
       Valid values for format are:

       &#183; &quot;&quot;: attempt to autodetect the file format.

       &#183; &quot;caca&quot;: import native libcaca files.

       &#183; &quot;text&quot;: import ASCII text files.

       &#183; &quot;ansi&quot;: import ANSI files.

       &#183; &quot;utf8&quot;: import UTF-8 files with ANSI colour codes.

       The number of bytes read is returned. If the file format is valid, but
       not enough data was available, 0 is returned.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate canvas.

       &#183; EINVAL Invalid format requested.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas in which to import the file.
           data A memory area containing the data to be loaded into the canvas.
           len The size in bytes of the memory area.
           format A string describing the input format.

       Returns:
           The number of bytes read, or 0 if there was not enough data, or -1 if
           an error occurred.

       caca_import_canvas_from_file().

   __extern ssize_t caca_import_canvas_from_file (caca_canvas_t *cv, char const
       *filename, char const *format) Import a file into the given libcaca
       canvas&apos;s current frame. The current frame is resized accordingly and its
       contents are replaced with the imported data.
       Valid values for format are:

       &#183; &quot;&quot;: attempt to autodetect the file format.

       &#183; &quot;caca&quot;: import native libcaca files.

       &#183; &quot;text&quot;: import ASCII text files.

       &#183; &quot;ansi&quot;: import ANSI files.

       &#183; &quot;utf8&quot;: import UTF-8 files with ANSI colour codes.

       The number of bytes read is returned. If the file format is valid, but
       not enough data was available, 0 is returned.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set accordingly:

       &#183; ENOSYS File access is not implemented on this system.

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate canvas.

       &#183; EINVAL Invalid format requested. caca_import_file() may also fail and
         set errno for any of the errors specified for the routine fopen().

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas in which to import the file.
           filename The name of the file to load.
           format A string describing the input format.

       Returns:
           The number of bytes read, or 0 if there was not enough data, or -1 if
           an error occurred.

       into the given libcaca canvas&apos;s current frame, at the specified position.
       For more information, see caca_import_canvas_from_memory().

       &#183; ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate canvas.

       Parameters:
           cv A libcaca canvas in which to import the file.
           x The leftmost coordinate of the area to import to.

       Returns:
           The number of bytes read, or 0 if there was not enough data, or -1 if

   __extern char const* const* caca_get_import_list (void) Return a list of
       available import formats. The list is a NULL-terminated array of strings,
