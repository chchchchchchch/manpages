VBETOOL(1)                        User Commands                       VBETOOL(1)



NAME
       vbetool - run real-mode video BIOS code to alter hardware state


SYNOPSIS
       vbetool    [[vbestate   save|restore]|[vbemode   set|get]|[vgamode]|[dpms
       on|off|standby|suspend|reduced]|[post [romfile]]|[vgastate on|off]|[vbefp
       panelid|panelsize|getbrightness|setbrightness|invert]]


DESCRIPTION
       vbetool uses lrmi in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently, it
       is able to alter DPMS states, save/restore video card state  and  attempt
       to initialize the video card from scratch.


OPTIONS
       vbetool takes the following options:

       vbestate
              vbetool  will  use  the  VESA 0x4f0f extensions to save or restore
              hardware state. This will be sent to  or  read  from  stdin.  This
              information  is  highly  hardware  specific  -  do  not attempt to
              restore state saved from a different machine.  This  command  will
              not  work unless you are at a text console, as it interferes badly
              with X.


       dpms   vbetool will use the VESA 0x4f10 extensions  to  alter  the  power
              management state of your screen. &quot;On&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;standby&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;
              and &quot;reduced&quot; are acceptable further options and  determine  which
              state will be activated.


       vbemode
              vbetool  will  get or set the current VESA mode. &quot;get&quot; will return
              the current mode number on stdout - &quot;set&quot; will set the mode to the
              next argument.


       vgamode
              vbetool  will  set  the  legacy  VGA mode to the following numeric
              argument.


       post   vbetool will attempt to run BIOS code located at  c000:0003.  This
              is  the  code run by the system BIOS at boot in order to intialise
              the video hardware. Note that on some  machines  (especially  lap&#8208;
              tops),  not  all  of this code is present after system boot - as a
              result, executing this command may result in undefined  behaviour.
              This command must be run from a text console, as it will otherwise
              interfere with the operation of X. This command takes an  optional
              argument  which  is the location of a file containing a ROM image.
              If provided, this image will be mapped to  the  c000  segment  and
              used instead of the system&apos;s video BIOS.


       vgastate
              vbetool  will  enable  or  disable the current video card. On most
              hardware, disabling will cause the  hardware  to  stop  responding
              until  it  is  reenabled.  You  probably  don&apos;t want to do this if
              you&apos;re using a framebuffer.


       vbefp  vbetool will execute a VESA flat panel interface call.

              panelid will provide information about the panel

              panelsize will provide the size of the panel

              getbrightness will provide the current  screen  brightness  as  an
              integer

              setbrightness  accepts  an integer as an argument and will set the
              screen brightness to that

              invert will invert the colours of the screen


BUGS
       Switching dpms modes may interact badly with X on some systems.

       The vbestate command may behave in strange ways.

       The post command may result in the execution of arbitrary code that  hap&#8208;
       pens  to be lying around in the area where chunks of your video BIOS used
       to be.

       The VESA specification does not require that &quot;vbemode get&quot;  provides  the
       correct  mode  if  the current mode was set via some means other than the
       VESA BIOS extensions.

       The VESA flat panel interface ceased development at the  proposal  stage.
       panelid and panelsize will work on many machines, but the other arguments
       are unlikely to be implemented on available hardware.
