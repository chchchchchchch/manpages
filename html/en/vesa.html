DESCRIPTION
       vesa  is  an Xorg driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive most
       VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use  of  the  basic  standard
       VESA  core  that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 8,
       15 16 and 24.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The vesa driver supports most VESA-compatible  video  cards.   There  are
       some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer  to  xorg.conf(5)  for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the presence of  VESA-compatible  hardware.   The
       ChipSet name may optionally be specified in the config file &quot;Device&quot; sec&#8208;
       tion, and will override the auto-detection:

           &quot;vesa&quot;

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer  layer.   Default:
              on.

              This option is recommended for performance reasons.

       Option &quot;ModeSetClearScreen&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Clear the screen on mode set. Some BIOSes seem to be broken in the
              sense that the newly set video mode is bogus if they are asked  to
              clear  the  screen during mode setting. If you experience problems
              try to turn this option off. Default: on.
