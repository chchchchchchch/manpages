vga_blitwait(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_blitwait(3)



NAME
       vga_blitwait - wait for any accelerator operation to finish

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_blitwait(void);


DESCRIPTION
       waits for any accelerator operation to finish. Though already implemented
       not useful because these old style functions do not  allow  for  parallel
       operation  of  the accelerator. A limited use might be to wait for a run&#8208;
       ning operation to complete in a signal(2) handler.

       This is an old style function to access the accelerator of an SVGA  card.
       Before  calling  it  you should check for availability of the function in
       the mode you use with vga_getmodeinfo(3).

       For new applications you might be better of trying  to  use  vga_accel(3)
       instead.

       The  old  vga_bitblt(3),  vga_blitwait(3), vga_fillblt(3), vga_hlinelist&#8208;
       blt(3), and vga_imageblt(3) interface was  originally  designed  for  the
       Cirrus chipsets. Then Mach32 added support too but has problems to resem&#8208;
       ble the unintuitive Cirrus interface. Then these  new  ideas  were  rein&#8208;
       jected and vga_accel(3) was designed. Now Cirrus and Chips &amp; Technologies
       chipset give limited vga_accel(3) support but no longer  this  old  style
       support.  Mach32 is left to use the unintuitive Cirrus interface. At some
       future point the functions might be added for Mach32 too (which should be
       rather  simple),  so  new  applications should use the newer and probably
       more efficient interface.

       It would be fatal if the accelerator would be used while the  console  is
       switched away.  You should use vga_lockvc(3) and vga_unlockvc(3) to avoid
       this, although good implementations of the  accelerator  functions  (like
       Mach32) will already ensure that.

       The testaccel(6) demo utilizes the old style accelerator functions.
