vga_clear(3)                   Svgalib User Manual                  vga_clear(3)



NAME
       vga_clear - clear the screen

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_clear(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Clears  the  screen  and  sets  all visible pixels to 0 (which is usually
       black). This is automatically done by a vga_setmode(3) call.

       The function always returns 0 (on which you should  probably  not  really
       rely).

       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. The exact source of the referenced function as well as of  the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
