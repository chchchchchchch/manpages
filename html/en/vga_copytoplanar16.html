vga_copytoplanar16(3)          Svgalib User Manual         vga_copytoplanar16(3)



NAME
       vga_copytoplanar16 - copy linear pixmap into VGA 16 color mode video mem&#8208;
       ory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_copytoplanar16(unsigned char *virtual, int pitch,  int  voffset,
       int vpitch, int w, int h);


DESCRIPTION
       Similar  to  vga_copytoplanar256(3),  but  for  16  color modes (not well
       tested). Assumes pixels stored in consecutive bytes ranging from 0 to  15
       in the virtual screen.

       Copies  part  of  a linear virtual screen in system memory at *virtual to
       VGA 16 mode video memory.  pitch is the  logical  width  of  the  virtual
       screen  (in  pixels  (which  are one byte large)), voffset is the address
       offset into video memory, vpitch is the logical  scanline  width  of  the
       screen.   (w, h) is the size of the area to copy in pixels (width must be
       multiple of 4).
