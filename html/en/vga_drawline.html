vga_drawline(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_drawline(3)



NAME
       vga_drawline - draw a line on the screen

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_drawline(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);


DESCRIPTION
       draws  a  line  from  (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) on the screen. If you exchange
       start and end of the line you should not expect the exactly identical set
       of pixel be covered by the line.

       This  function is very inefficient as is does a bunch of vga_drawpixel(3)
       calls, you should consider using gl_line(3) which is very  efficient,  or
       doing  direct screen access instead or use vga_drawscansegment(3) to han&#8208;
       dle more than one pixel.

       The color drawn is set with vga_setcolor(3) or vga_setrgbcolor(3) resp.

       The function always returns 0 (on which you should  probably  not  really
       rely).
