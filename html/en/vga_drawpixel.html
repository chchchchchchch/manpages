vga_drawpixel(3)               Svgalib User Manual              vga_drawpixel(3)



NAME
       vga_drawpixel - draw a pixel on the screen

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_drawpixel(int x, int y);


DESCRIPTION
       Read  a  pixels value from the screen. This function is very inefficient,
       you  should  consider  doing  direct  screen  access   instead   or   use
       vga_drawscansegment(3) to handle more than one pixel.

       The color drawn is set with vga_setcolor(3) or vga_setrgbcolor(3) resp.

       The  function  always  returns 0 (on which you should probably not really
       rely).

AUTHOR
       This manual page  was  edited  by  Michael  Weller  &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;.  The exact source of the referenced function as well as of the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due  to  Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally  this  might  be  wrong. I hereby asked to be excused by the
       original author and will happily accept any additions or  corrections  to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
