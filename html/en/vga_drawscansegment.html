vga_drawscansegment(3)         Svgalib User Manual        vga_drawscansegment(3)



NAME
       vga_drawscansegment - draw a horizontal line of pixels

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_drawscansegment(unsigned char *colors, int x, int y, int length);


DESCRIPTION
       draws  a  horizontal  line  of length pixels starting at position (x, y).
       The colors drawn are taken from color[0] .. color[length -  1].   Svgalib
       versions  prior to 1.2.10 required x, y, and length to be multiples of 8.
       This is no longer true.  In high/truecolor  modes,  the  length  must  be
       given in bytes, not pixels.
