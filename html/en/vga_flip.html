vga_flip(3)                    Svgalib User Manual                   vga_flip(3)



NAME
       vga_flip - toggle between text and graphics mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_flip(void);


DESCRIPTION
       switches  between  graphics  and  text mode without destroying the screen
       contents. This makes it possible for your application to  use  both  text
       and graphics output.

       However,  This  is  an old vgalib function. You should really only use it
       for debugging as it runs extremely unstable because svgalib now does  its
       own  virtual console management. If you want to perform a similar action,
       save the current screen contents with ordinary memory copy  operation  to
       the  frame  buffer  or  gl_getbox(3),  set  vga_setmode(TEXT),  then call
       vga_setmode(3) to return to graphics operation  and  restore  the  screen
       contents with memory or gl_putbox(3).

       One  could  also  use  vga_drawscansegment(3)  and  vga_getscansegment(3)
       calls.

       However, avoid any calls to vga_flip() in your applications.

       The function always returns 0, a fact on which you shouldn&apos;t rely.

       It might be useful if you are debugging one of your svgalib  applications
       though.  If your program reaches a breakpoint while in graphics mode, you
       can switch to text mode with the gdb command

       print vga_flip()

       and later restore the graphics screen contents with the same command.  It
       is useful to define the following alias in gdb:

       define flip &lt;Return&gt; print vga_flip() &lt;Return&gt; end &lt;Return&gt;

       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
