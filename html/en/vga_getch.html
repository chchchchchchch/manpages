vga_getch(3)                   Svgalib User Manual                  vga_getch(3)



NAME
       vga_getch - wait for a key

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_getch(void);


DESCRIPTION
       waits for a key press just like getchar(3) would.

       For  a  non  blocking  check  for  a  keypress  use  vga_getkey(3) or use
       vga_waitevent(3) if you want to wait for several events to occur at once.
