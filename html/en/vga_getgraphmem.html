vga_getgraphmem(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_getgraphmem(3)



NAME
       vga_getgraphmem - returns the address of the VGA memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       unsigned char *graph_mem; /* This declaration is already in vga.h */

       unsigned char *vga_getgraphmem(void);


DESCRIPTION
       returns  a  pointer  to the 64K VGA frame buffer window.  vga_setpage(3),
       vga_setreadpage(3) and vga_setwritepage(3) allow to select which page  of
       the  VGA  memory  shows  up at this position.  vga_setlinearaddressing(3)
       maps all VGA memory at a consecutive memory area (if  the  hardware  sup&#8208;
       ports  it).   In this mode, vga_getgraphmem() will return the location of
       this area too. You can also access the global variable  graph_mem,  which
       will also contain this address.

       Most  demos, esp.  vgatest(6) show the simple direct use of this function
       to access screen memory.
