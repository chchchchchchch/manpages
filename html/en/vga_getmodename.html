NAME
       vga_getmodename - return a name for the given video mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       char *vga_getmodename(int mode);


DESCRIPTION
       A  pointer  to  a  static memory buffer is returned. Depending on mode it
       consist of a capital G followed by the amount of x pixels, followed by  a
       lower  case  x,  followed  by the amount of y pixels, followed by a lower
       case x.  Finally the number of different colors  is  appended.  Here  the
       shortcuts  32K,64K,16M,  and 16M4 are used for 32768, 65536, and 16777216
       are used. The last refers also to 16777216 which are  store  in  4  bytes
       (highest address byte unused) for easier screen access.

       For  unsupported  values of mode the empty string &quot;&quot; is returned. In gen&#8208;
       eral the string resembles the corresponding #define for the videomode  in
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;.
