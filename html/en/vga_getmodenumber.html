vga_getmodenumber(3)           Svgalib User Manual          vga_getmodenumber(3)



NAME
       vga_getmodenumber - return a number for the given video mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_getmodenumber(char *name);


DESCRIPTION
       The  function parses *name and tries to find a videomode corresponding on
       it.  *name is parsed case insensitive and should  be  either  an  integer
       string  just  giving  a mode number or consist of a capital G followed by
       the amount of x pixels, followed by a  lower  case  x,  followed  by  the
       amount  of  y  pixels, followed by a lower case x.  Finally the number of
       different colors is appended. Here the shortcuts  32K,64K,16M,  and  16M4
       are used for 32768, 65536, and 16777216 are used. The last refers also to
       16777216 which are store in 4 bytes (highest  address  byte  unused)  for
       easier screen access.

       For  unsupported  values or the string &quot;PROMPT&quot; the value -1 is returned.
       Also a irritating error message is printed to stdout. This is used during
       parsing the SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE environment variable. Probably it should
       not be used for anything else.


EXAMPLE
       vga_getmodenumber(&quot;G640x480x256&quot;) returns 10.
