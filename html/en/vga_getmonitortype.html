vga_getmonitortype(3)          Svgalib User Manual         vga_getmonitortype(3)



NAME
       vga_getmonitortype - returns the monitor type configured

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_getmonitortype(void);


DESCRIPTION
       This returns the monitor type configered in /etc/vga/libvga.config.  This
       function is really obsolete, as the result is of  not  much  use  to  the
       application  vga_getmodeinfo(3)  and  vga_hasmode(3) do already check the
       monitor type and there are more flexible ways to specify it too.

       The return value is one of:

       MON640_60
              31.5 KHz (standard VGA): does 640x480 in 60Hz vsync.
       MON800_56
              35.1 KHz (old SVGA): does 800x600 in 56Hz vsync.
       MON1024_43I
              35.5 KHz (low-end SVGA, 8514): does 1024x768 in 43Hz vsync  inter&#8208;
              laced.
       MON800_60
              37.9 KHz (SVGA): does 800x600 in 60Hz vsync.
       MON1024_60
              48.3  KHz (SVGA non-interlaced): does 1024x768 in 60Hz vsync, non-
              interlaced.
       MON1024_70
              56.0 KHz (SVGA high frequency): does 1024x768 in 70Hz vsync.
