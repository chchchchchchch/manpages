vga_getpalvec(3)               Svgalib User Manual              vga_getpalvec(3)



NAME
       vga_getpalvec - gets colors from the color lookup table

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_getpalvec(int start, int num, int *pal);


DESCRIPTION
       Gets the num colors starting with index start from the color lookup table
       and stores the RGB values in *pal. *pal contains 3 * num  integers  which
       are  the  color values from first to last palette entry in the order red,
       green, blue (always three consecutive entries in  *pal  built  a  palette
       entry.

       Each color entry is in range 0 - 63. This function is only sensible in 16
       or 256 color modes. It shows which color all vga_setcolor(start) (and num
       - 1 following colors) drawn pixels will actually refer to.

       If  the VGA_CLUT8 feature is set for the current mode with vga_ext_set(3)
       the red, green, and blue values are in the range 0 - 255.

       The function returns the value of num.
