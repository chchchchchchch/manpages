vga_getpixel(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_getpixel(3)



NAME
       vga_getpixel - get a pixels value from the screen

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_getpixel(int x, int y);


DESCRIPTION
       Read  a  pixels value from the screen. This function is very inefficient,
       you  should  consider  doing  direct  screen  access   instead   or   use
       vga_getscansegment(3) to handle more than one pixel.

AUTHOR
       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. The exact source of the referenced function as well as of  the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
