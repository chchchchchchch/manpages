vga_gettextfont(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_gettextfont(3)



NAME
       vga_gettextfont, vga_puttextfont - get/set the font used in text mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_gettextfont(void *font);
       void vga_puttextfont(void *font);


DESCRIPTION
       The  functions  gives  access  to the buffer where svgalib saves the font
       used by the kernel.  This is used by the restorefont(1), savetextmode(1),
       and textmode(1) utilities to restore a possibly screwed console font.

       The  font  buffer occupies 8192 bytes. However, versions 1.2.13 and later
       use a larger buffer internally and the size  of  the  buffers  passed  to
       vga_gettextfont(3) and vga_puttextfont(3) can be set with vga_ext_set(3).

       The  functions  give  access  to the internal buffers of svgalib, not the
       font tables of the VGA card. This  means  that  both  functions  must  be
       called  in  graphics  mode  and a newly set font takes effect only at the
       next vga_setmode(TEXT) call.
