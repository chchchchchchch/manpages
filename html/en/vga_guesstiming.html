vga_addtiming(3)               Svgalib User Manual              vga_addtiming(3)



NAME
       vga_guesstiming - calculate a timing line for the given resolution

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_guesstiming(int x, int y, int clue, int arg);


DESCRIPTION
       Calculates  a timing line for a x*y resolution, according to the value of
       clue.


CALCULATION METHODS
       If clue is 0, then the aspect ratio for the requested mode ( x:y  )  must
       be 4:3. A mode with the same aspect ratio closest to the requested, while
       still having a higher resolution is found, and then scaled  down  to  the
       requested mode.

       If  clue  is 1, then the aspect ratio for the requested mode ( x:y ) must
       be 4:3. A mode with the same aspect ratio closest to the requested, while
       still  having  a  lower  resolution is found, and then scaled down to the
       requested mode.


BUGS
       No guarantee that a modeline will be created, or that a created  modeline
       will be usefull is given.
