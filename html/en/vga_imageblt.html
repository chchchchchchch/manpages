vga_imageblt(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_imageblt(3)



NAME
       vga_imageblt - copy a rectangular pixmap from system memory to video mem&#8208;
       ory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_imageblt(void *srcaddr, int destaddr, int w, int h, int pitch);


DESCRIPTION
       Write a rectangular pixmap from system memory to video memory.   destaddr
       is an offset into video memory (up to 2M). The pitch is the logical width
       of the screen. Height h is in Pixels, Width w is in BYTES!

       It  fills the given box with the data in memory area *srcaddr.  The  mem&#8208;
       ory   buffer  must  contain the pixels in the same representation as used
       in the vga memory, starting at the top left corner, from left  to  right,
       and  then,  line  by  line,  from  up  to  down,  without  any  gaps  and
       interline spaces.

       This is an old style function to access the accelerator of an SVGA  card.
       Before  calling  it  you should check for availability of the function in
       the mode you use with vga_getmodeinfo(3).

       For new applications you might be better of trying  to  use  vga_accel(3)
       instead.

       The  old  vga_bitblt(3),  vga_blitwait(3), vga_fillblt(3), vga_hlinelist&#8208;
       blt(3), and vga_imageblt(3) interface was  originally  designed  for  the
       Cirrus chipsets. Then Mach32 added support too but has problems to resem&#8208;
       ble the unintuitive Cirrus interface. Then these  new  ideas  were  rein&#8208;
       jected and vga_accel(3) was designed. Now Cirrus and Chips &amp; Technologies
       chipset give limited vga_accel(3) support but no longer  this  old  style
       support.  Mach32 is left to use the unintuitive Cirrus interface. At some
       future point the functions might be added for Mach32 too (which should be
       rather  simple),  so  new  applications should use the newer and probably
       more efficient interface.

       It would be fatal if the accelerator would be used while the  console  is
       switched away.  You should use vga_lockvc(3) and vga_unlockvc(3) to avoid
       this, although good implementations of the  accelerator  functions  (like
       Mach32) will already ensure that.

       The testaccel(6) demo utilizes the old style accelerator functions.
