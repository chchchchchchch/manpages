vga_oktowrite(3)               Svgalib User Manual              vga_oktowrite(3)



NAME
       vga_oktowrite  -  indicates  whether the program has direct access to the
       SVGA

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_oktowrite(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Indicates whether the program is in the console currently visible on  the
       screen, that is, whether it is OK to write to video memory (if running in
       the background has been allowed with the function above). Note that  this
       is not entirely safe, since a console switch interrupt may occur during a
       video operation. It is best to avoid this function.

       Usually your program will be suspended when  it  has  no  access  to  the
       screen but see vga_runinbackground(3) for an alternative.

       original documentation is unknown.

       It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due  to  Harm
