vga_screenoff(3)               Svgalib User Manual              vga_screenoff(3)



NAME
       vga_screenoff,  vga_screenon  - turn generation of the video signal on or
       off

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_screenoff(void);
       int vga_screenon(void);


DESCRIPTION
       The functions turn the generation of the video signal on or off. On  some
       video boards, SVGA memory access is faster when no video signal is gener&#8208;
       ated. On the other hand, not all boards allow to disable it (at least not
       in all modes).

       The  functions  always  return 0 (on which you should probably not really
       rely).

SEE ALSO
       svgalib(7),  vgagl(7),  libvga.config(5),  vga_init(3),   vga_setmode(3),
       vga_clear(3),

AUTHOR
       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;. The exact source of the referenced function as well as of  the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
