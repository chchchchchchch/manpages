vga_setchipset(3)              Svgalib User Manual             vga_setchipset(3)



NAME
       vga_setchipset - force chipset

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setchipset(int chipset);


DESCRIPTION
       Force   detection   of   a   chipset   (when  chipset  detection  fails).
       vga_setchipset(VGA) can be useful if the chipset specific  stuff  or  the
       SVGA detection stuff gives problems.

       However,  at first the automatic detection should work well, and if not a
       specific chipset can be forced from /etc/vga/libvga.config.

       Because of that, void vga_setchipset(int chipset) should  probably  never
       be  used  by  applications.  If  used  nevertheless,  it should be called
       directly before vga_init(3).

       As of now the following values are defined for chipset:

       UNDEFINED
              This is the default and specifies autodetection.

       VGA    A plain VGA card, not that the SVGA must behave like  an  ordinary
              SVGA  card  then  which  will  probably  mean it is in an ordinary
              (25x80) textmode.

       ET4000 Tseng ET4000/ET4000W32(i/p) cards.

       CIRRUS Cirrus Logic GD542x/3x cards.

       TVGA8900
              Trident TVGA 8900C/9000 (and possibly also 8800CS/8900A/B) cards.

       OAK    Oak Technologies OTI-037/67/77/87 cards.

       EGA    An ordinary EGA card. The notes about VGA apply.

       S3     An S3 base card.

       ET3000 Tseng ET3000 cards.

       MACH32 A card (from ATI or not) based on the ATI Mach32 chipset.

       GVGA6400

       ARK    ARK Logic ARK1000PV/2000PV cards.

       ATI    An ATI SVGA (VGA Wonder and friends) card. This does  not  (neces&#8208;
              sarily) include the newer cards (usually called Mach something).

       ALI    An ALI2301 based card.

       MACH64 A card using the ATI Mach64 chipset. Support is not complete.

       CHIPS  Chips and Technologies chipsets 65525, 65535, 65546, 65548, 65550,
