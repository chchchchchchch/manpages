vga_setchipsetandfeatures(3)   Svgalib User Manual  vga_setchipsetandfeatures(3)



NAME
       vga_setchipsetandfeatures - force chipset and optional parameters

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setchipsetandfeatures(int chipset, int par1, int par2);


DESCRIPTION
       Force  chipset,  and  optional parameters like the exact chipset type and
       the amount of video memory installed.  This  function  works  similar  to
       vga_setchipset(3)  and  allows  the same values for chipset.  In addition
       you can pass additional parameters to the  setup  routine  whose  meaning
       heavily  depend on the driver. You should only use this for debugging and
       if you know what you do, which is why we do not  document  anything  more
       here.
