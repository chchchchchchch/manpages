vga_setcolor(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_setcolor(3)



NAME
       vga_setcolor - set the current color

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setcolor(int color);


DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  current color to color.  You may only use vga_setcolor() in 256
       or less color modes. For the other modes you must use  vga_setrgbcolor(3)
       instead.

       The color is used by vga_drawpixel(3) and vga_drawline(3).

       The fun(6) and vgatest(6) demos show the basic use of this function.

       original documentation is unknown.

       It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due  to  Harm
