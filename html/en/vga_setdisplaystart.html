vga_setdisplaystart(3)         Svgalib User Manual        vga_setdisplaystart(3)



NAME
       vga_setdisplaystart - set the display start address

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setdisplaystart(int a);


DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  display  start address to a, where the address is the number of
       pixels offset from the start of video memory,  except  for  hicolor/true&#8208;
       color  modes,  which  use a unit of 1 byte. Can be used for page-flipping
       and virtual desktop scrolling. May not work properly for 16 color modes.

       You should ensure that the memory displayed is actually available on  the
       SVGA  card (query memory size with vga_modeinfo(3)) and ensure that it is
       saved by svgalib during console switches with vga_claimvideomemory(3).

       You may only set the bits  of  the  display  start  address  returned  by
       vga_modeinfo(3).
