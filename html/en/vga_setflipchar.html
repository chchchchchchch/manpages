vga_setflipchar(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_setflipchar(3)



NAME
       vga_setflipchar - set the character causing a vga_flip()

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_setflipchar(int c);


DESCRIPTION
       This  sets the ASCII code of the key which causes vga_getch(3) to shortly
       switch between graphics and text mode when waiting for a keypress.  &lt;ESC&gt;
       is the default at startup.

       Because  one can now swicth directly between consoles even when in graph&#8208;
       ics modes and the use of vga_flip(3) is discouraged except for debugging,
       this function is just there for vgalib compatibility but has no effect!

       vga_waitevent(3),

AUTHOR
       This manual page  was  edited  by  Michael  Weller  &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;.  The exact source of the referenced function as well as of the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due  to  Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally  this  might  be  wrong. I hereby asked to be excused by the
       original author and will happily accept any additions or  corrections  to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
