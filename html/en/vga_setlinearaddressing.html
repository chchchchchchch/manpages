vga_setlinearaddressing(3)     Svgalib User Manual    vga_setlinearaddressing(3)



NAME
       vga_setlinearaddressing - switch to linear addressing mode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_setlinearaddressing(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Switch  to  linear  addressing  mode. This maps all (or most) of the SVGA
       memory at the position returned by vga_getgraphmem(3) (which will  proba&#8208;
       bly    change   by   the   call   to   vga_setlinearaddressing()).    The
       vga_set*page(3) calls are no longer required. This ensures  optimal  per&#8208;
       formance,  however  the  drawing functions of svgalib do not support this
       memory layout and not all cards support it (and not in all modes).

       Use vga_modeinfo(3) to check for availability of the function in a  given
       mode.

       Furthermore, some cards (Cirrus) just enable this buffer at a fixed hard&#8208;
       ware address.  For Cirrus it is mapped at 14MB so you should  never  used
       it  if  you  have  more  than 14MB of memory (But how does an application
       know?).  The Mach32 support for this is smarter. It  makes  this  feature
       only available when it is safe to be used.

       To avoid all this problems you can use


       nolinear
              Inhibit use of a linear mmaped frame buffer.

       linear Allow (not enforce!) use of a linear mmaped frame buffer.

       in  the /etc/vga/libvga.config file to disable the linear frame buffer if
       it cannot be used.

       Returns the size of the mapped framebuffer if  successful  (can  be  less
       than total video memory), -1 if not.

       The testlinear(6) demo shows the use of this feature (and if it works for
       you).
