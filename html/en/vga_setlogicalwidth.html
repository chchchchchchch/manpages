vga_setlogicalwidth(3)         Svgalib User Manual        vga_setlogicalwidth(3)



NAME
       vga_setlogicalwidth - set the logical scanline width

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setlogicalwidth(int l);


DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  logical  scanline width to l bytes. It must be a multiple of 8.
       Only changes the VGA register,  drawing  functions  don&apos;t  take  it  into
       account.  The  logical scan line width is the offset between points above
       each other in consecutive lines. Note that for some  cards  and  graphics
       modes  a  multiple of 8 will not suffice to ensure a proper video timing.
       You should only set l to multiples of the value returned for that  graph&#8208;
       ics mode by vga_modeinfo(3).
