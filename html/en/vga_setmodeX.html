vga_setmodeX(3)                Svgalib User Manual               vga_setmodeX(3)



NAME
       vga_setmodeX - try to set Mode X-like memory organization

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setmodeX(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Try  to  enable Mode X-like memory organization for 256 color modes using
       up to 256K of memory like 320x200x256 and 640x400x256.

       Modes like 320x240x256 etc. are Mode X-like by default.   vga_modeinfo(3)
       lists which modes have Mode X memory layout.

       A  mode X like memory layout means that memory is organized in four pages
       (set_page(3)) and that the top most pixel 0,1,2,3 are the first pixel  in
       pages  0,1,2,3.  Pixels  4,5,6,7  are  than  the  second  pixels in pages
       0,1,2,3.

       The other, packed pixel, mode will have pixel 0,1,2,3 as pixel 0,1,2,3 in
       page  0  and  so  on.  It will only use the next pages if the size of the
       first 64K page is exceeded. Most SVGA 256 color modes work this way.

       This is not guaranteed to work. Probably a new mode should be defined for
       planar 320x200x256.
