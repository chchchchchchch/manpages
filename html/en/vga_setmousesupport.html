vga_setmousesupport(3)         Svgalib User Manual        vga_setmousesupport(3)



NAME
       vga_setmousesupport - enable mouse support

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setmousesupport(int stat);


DESCRIPTION
       Set mouse support; 0 disables (default), 1 enabled. If enabled, the mouse
       is set up for screen resolution after a mode set and you can use the var&#8208;
       ious  mouse_  functions. You can also use mouse_init(3) the mouse in more
       flexibility. However, usually this is not the deal  of  the  application.
       The  mouse is configured in /etc/vga/libvga.config and usually the appli&#8208;
       cation will just want to use that.

       The mousetest(6), eventtest(6), and spin(6) demos make use of  the  mouse
       functions.
