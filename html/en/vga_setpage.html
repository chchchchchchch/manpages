vga_setpage(3)                 Svgalib User Manual                vga_setpage(3)



NAME
       vga_setpage - set the 64K SVGA page number

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setpage(int page);


DESCRIPTION
       Usually  SVGA  cards  have  more than the 64K memory which suffice for an
       ordinary VGA.  However, the memory window mapped at vga_getgraphmem(3) is
       only 64K bytes large.  vga_setpage() selects the page-th 64K memory chunk
       to be visible at position vga_getgraphmem(3).

       The fun(6) and vgatest(6) show the basic use of this function.
