NAME
       vga_setpalvec - sets colors in the color lookup table

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_setpalvec(int start, int num, int *pal);


DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the num colors starting with index start to the RGB values in *pal.
       *pal contains 3 * num integers which are the color  values  to  set  from
       first  to  last palette entry in the order red, green, blue (always three
       consecutive entries in *pal built a palette entry.

       Each color entry is in range 0 - 63. This function is only sensible in 16
       or  256  color modes. It selects which color all vga_setcolor(start) (and
       num - 1 following colors) drawn pixels will actually refer to.

       Note that setting color 0 will modify the background color and that  set&#8208;
       ting  any color in range 0 .. 15 will affect the operation of vga_setega&#8208;
       color(3).

       If the VGA_CLUT8 feature is set for the current mode with  vga_ext_set(3)
       the red, green, and blue values are in the range 0 - 255.

       The function returns the value of num.
