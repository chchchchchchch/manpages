vga_setreadpage(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_setreadpage(3)



NAME
       vga_setreadpage - set the 64K SVGA page number

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setreadpage(int page);


DESCRIPTION
       Usually  SVGA  cards  have  more than the 64K memory which suffice for an
       ordinary VGA.  However, the memory window mapped at vga_getgraphmem(3) is
       only  64K  bytes large.  vga_setreadpage() selects the page-th 64K memory
       chunk to be visible for reads at position vga_getgraphmem(3).

       vga_setwritepage(3) allows a different 64K memory chunk to be modified by
       writes to this memory window. This is a very useful feature for screen to
       screen pixmap copies. However, not all cards support this in all graphics
       mode.  Check  vga_modeinfo(3)  for availability. Esp. as this feature can
       also not be used when in background mode.

       Of  course,  this   function   must   be   used   in   conjunction   with
       vga_setwritepage(3)  but  may  not  be  used in conjunction with vga_set&#8208;
       page(3).
