vga_setrgbcolor(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_setrgbcolor(3)



NAME
       vga_setrgbcolor - set the current color

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setrgbcolor(int r, int g, int b);


DESCRIPTION
       Set the current color to RGB values r, g, and b, each in the range 0-255.
       Does not make sense in 256  or  less  color  modes.  Use  vga_setcolor(3)
       there. The color is used by vga_drawpixel(3) and vga_drawline(3).

       The fun(6) and vgatest(6) demos show the basic use of this function.

       This manual page  was  edited  by  Michael  Weller  &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-
       essen.de&gt;.  The exact source of the referenced function as well as of the
       original documentation is unknown.

       It is very likely that both are at least to some extent are due  to  Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally  this  might  be  wrong. I hereby asked to be excused by the
       original author and will happily accept any additions or  corrections  to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
