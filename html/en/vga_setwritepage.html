vga_setwritepage(3)            Svgalib User Manual           vga_setwritepage(3)



NAME
       vga_setwritepage - set the 64K SVGA page number

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_setwritepage(int page);


DESCRIPTION
       Usually  SVGA  cards  have  more than the 64K memory which suffice for an
       ordinary VGA.  However, the memory window mapped at vga_getgraphmem(3) is
       only  64K bytes large.  vga_setwritepage() selects the page-th 64K memory
       chunk to be visible for writes at position vga_getgraphmem(3).

       vga_setreadpage(3) allows a different 64K memory chunk to be modified  by
       reads  from  this memory window. This is a very useful feature for screen
       to screen pixmap copies. However, not  all  cards  support  this  in  all
       graphics modes. Check vga_modeinfo(3) for availability. Esp. as this fea&#8208;
       ture can also not be used when in background mode.

       Of course, this function must be used in  conjunction  with  vga_setread&#8208;
       page(3) but may not be used in conjunction with vga_setpage(3).

       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
