vga_waitretrace(3)             Svgalib User Manual            vga_waitretrace(3)



NAME
       vga_waitretrace - wait for vertical retrace.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       void vga_waitretrace(void);


DESCRIPTION
       Wait  for  vertical  retrace,  that  is when the video beam goes dark and
       returns from the bottom line to the top line. Useful to synchronize  ani&#8208;
       mation with monitor refresh.

       However,  Linux  is  a  multiuser  OS,  thus  some time might have passed
       already when the function returns. Also, not all cards  support  this  in
       all modes (or with more or less good results).


SEE ALSO

       This  manual  page  was  edited  by  Michael Weller &lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-

       original documentation is unknown.

       It  is  very likely that both are at least to some extent are due to Harm
       Hanemaayer &lt;H.Hanemaayer@inter.nl.net&gt;.

       Occasionally this might be wrong. I hereby asked to  be  excused  by  the
       original  author  and will happily accept any additions or corrections to
       this first version of the svgalib manual.
