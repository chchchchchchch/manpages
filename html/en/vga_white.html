vga_white(3)                   Svgalib User Manual                  vga_white(3)



NAME
       vga_white - return the color white in the current screen resolution

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;vga.h&gt;

       int vga_white(void);


DESCRIPTION
       vga_white()  returns  the color white in the current screen resolution as
       it would be set with vga_setcolor(3) or written directly into the screen.

       In high color modes it is always clear how white is set with  vga_setrgb&#8208;
       color(3).  In the other modes you need vga_white().

       However,  it  only knows about the default palette. If you change it with
       one of the palette functions the function will not know about it.
