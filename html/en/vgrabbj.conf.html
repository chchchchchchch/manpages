VGRABBJ.CONF(5)                                                  VGRABBJ.CONF(5)



NAME
       vgrabbj.conf - configuration file for vgrabbj

OVERVIEW
       vgrabbj  purpose  is to read data from a v4l-device and put it in a file,
       formatted as jpeg, png, or pnm.  Except  for  the  ftp-options  described
       below  everything can also handled on the commandline.  Here the configu&#8208;
       ration statements are described.

       Syntax is &lt;keyword&gt; &lt;value&gt;. Comments start with  a  &apos;;&apos;  or  &apos;#&apos;.  Those
       lines  are  ignored  by  vgrabbj.  Case of the keywords and named options
       doesn&apos;t matter except for the timestamp option as well as any filename.

       The configuration file is parsed line by line.  If  any  keyword  appears
       twice or more often, the last one is the one used.

       On startup, the pre-defined configuration file /etc/vgrabbj.conf is read.
       Then, commandline parameters are evaluated one by one, the  last  is  the
       most  significant,  if  one  option is provide twice or more often.  Same
       applies for the commandline parameter -c &lt;config-file&gt;.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       DaemonSeconds seconds
              Daemonize &amp; loop with seconds intervals (min. 1).

       Daemon microseconds
              Daemonize &amp; loop microseconds  intervals  (min.  1).  Same  as  -l
              except you can control it more precisely.

       AutoBrightness On|Off
              Defines  if  vgrabbj&apos;s  brightness adjustment is used. This option
              works only if the device supports data fetch via  read  and  RGB24
              videopalette. See ForcePalette on how-to set RGB24. Some device do
              not support RGB24, hence, Brightness is ignored.

       ImageQuality quality
              Sets the quality of a jpeg output to quality (1-100, default: 75).

       ImageSize imagesize
              Sets the imagesize of input device, where imagesize is one of:

               sqcif= 128x96,     qsif = 160x120,
               qcif = 176x144,    sif  = 320x240,
               cif  = 352x288,    vga  = 640x480,
               svga = 800x600,    xga  = 1024x768,
               sxga = 1280x1024,  uxga = 1600x1200,

              (default: cif)

       ImageWidth width
              Sets the width of the image to width. Needs  -H.   The  v4l-device
              has to support the image width you set with this option.

       ImageHeight height
              Sets  the height of the image to height. Needs -w.  The v4l-device
              has to support the image height you set with this option.

       OutputFormat format
              Sets the output to format (either  jpeg,  png,  or  pnm,  default:
              jpeg). Alternative, you may provide jpg for jpeg.

       OutputFile &lt;filename&gt;
              Output is written to filename (default: /dev/stdout)
&#12;       Archive &lt;path/filename&gt;
              Additional  output is written to path/filename (default: not set),
              whereas the path-filename can include any strftime component.  The
              path- filename must not be on a different filesystem as the output
              defined above.  Additionally, you need to take care of the  number
              of files stored. There is no upper ceiling for archiving.

       VideoDevice &lt;device&gt;
              Sets the input device to device (default: /dev/video)

       OpenOnce On|Off
              Defines  if  vgrabbj  opens  the  device  only while image data is
              grabbed (Off) or keeps it opened while it is running  (On).   Set&#8208;
              ting it to Off is helpful if you need access to the device besides
              vgrabbj. This use is discouraged though, due to possible  problems
              with memory fragmentation. Default is On.

       SetImageSize On|Off
              Defines  if  the  image size (see -i, -H, and -w) of the device is
              set by vgrabbj. Necessary for certain  v4l-devices  which  do  not
              support  to  be  set to a particular image size (e.g. IBM-usb-cam,
              QuickCam).  For these devices you have to specify the size at mod&#8208;
              ule load time.  Default is On.

       SwitchColor On|Off
              Switches  colormap  from  BGR to RGB (or vice versa) if set to On.
              Default is Off. Use if you have odd colors.

       SwapRL On|Off
              Swaps left and right of the image like a mirror. Default: Off.  is
              Off.

       SwapTB On|Off
              Swaps top and bottom of the image like a mirror. Default: Off.  is
              Off.

       NoUseMmap On|Off
              Turns off the use of mmap&apos;ed (better) memory allocation for  grab&#8208;
              bing  frames.  Some (very rare) cams cannot use mmap&apos;ed memory and
              have to use read. If you want to switch easily, use  this  switch.
              If  you  don&apos;t  know  what I&apos;m talking about, leafe it like it is:
              Default is Off.

       DebugLevel value
              Sets the loglevel of vgrabbj. Valid for value are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
              (default:  4). 0 means no messages at all, 7 is debug. Don&apos;t use 7
              if you are running vgrabbj in daemon mode, it&apos;ll surely fill  your
              syslog.  Be aware, that loglevel 7 will also post you ftp-password
              (if defined) in the logfile!

       UseTmpOut On|Off
              Sets the use of the temporary outputfile. Default is  On.  Ignored
              in  case  the default output (/dev/stdout) is used. If set to Off,
              the data is written directly to the file defined by OutputFile.

              If filename is different from /dev/stdout (given via -f  parameter
              or  OutputFile,  vgrabbj  defaults  to use a temporary file called
              filename.tmp to write the image. This  file  is  then  renamed  to
              filename  to shorten the time period corrupt data may be read from
              filename.

       ForcePalette palette
              Force the usage of the specified palette. If palette is  not  sup&#8208;
              ported  by either vgrabbj or the v4l-device, fallback to a palette
              supported by both is provided. If no common denominator is  avail&#8208;
              able,  vgrabbj  exits. Supported palettes are marked with * below.
              Possible values are (copy from videodev.h):
&#12;               1  VIDEO_PALETTE_GREY      Linear greyscale
               2  VIDEO_PALETTE_HI240     High 240 cube (BT848)
               3  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB565    565 16 bit RGB
               4 *VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB24     24bit RGB
               5 *VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB32     32bit RGB
               6  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB555    555 15bit RGB
               7 *VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422    YUV422 capture
               8 *VIDEO_PALETTE_YUYV
               9  VIDEO_PALETTE_UYVY
               10*VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420
               10 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411    YUV411 capture
               11 VIDEO_PALETTE_RAW       RAW capture (BT848)
               12 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422P   YUV 4:2:2 Planar
               13 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411P   YUV 4:1:1 Planar
               14*VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P   YUV 4:2:0 Planar
               15 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV410P   YUV 4:1:0 Planar
               16 VIDEO_PALETTE_PLANAR
               17 VIDEO_PALETTE_COMPONENT

              (no default, depends on v4l-device).

       DiscardFrames value
              value images are grabbed and immediately discarded. Only the  last
              image is written to the output. This might be helpful if your v4l-
              device needs to take a couple of images to auto-adjust to the cur&#8208;
              rent light.

ARCHIVE OPTIONS
       The  following options are useful if you want to keep a certain amount of
       images in an archive. Currently, the archive is only supported if kept on
       the same filesystem as the images taken.

       Archive &lt;archive-filename-pattern&gt;
              The  archive-filename-pattern  is evaluated as a timestring, hence
              the  same  applies  as   to   TimeStamp   (see   below,   default:
              /tmp/arch/cam-%Y-%d-%m-%H-%M-%S.jpg)

       ArchiveEach &lt;value&gt;
              Defines how many images have to be taken before a copy is made for
              the archive. E.g. if defined 1, each image is put in the  archive;
              if defined 5 every fifth image is put in the archive.

       ArchiveMax &lt;value&gt;
              Sets the maximum number of images to be put in the archive.

TIMESTAMP OPTIONS
       The following options are available only if vgrabbj was compiled with the
       freetype library available. The timestamp will only  be  enabled  if  all
       values  evaluated  (inlcuding defaults) lead to a valid configuration and
       UseTimestamp is set to On.

       UseTimestamp On|Off
              This is the essential setting to enable timestamps if  defined  in
              the  config file. Without this being set to On, it just won&apos;t work
              (although, if there are options set to have an invalid  configura&#8208;
              tion, it won&apos;t work either).  This is different to the handling on
              the commandline.

       FontFile filename
              The  TrueType  font  to  be  used  for  the   timestamp   (default
              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/Arialn.ttf).

       FontSize size
              Set the fontsize to size for timestamp (3-100, default: 12).

       TimeStamp format-str
              Defines  the  timestamp. format-str can be plain text or any strf&#8208;
              time format. Any &apos;&quot;&quot;&apos; at the beginning or the end will  be  elimi&#8208;
              nated  for  compatibility  reasons,  i.e.  they  are not necessary
              (default: &quot;%a, %e.  %B %Y - %T&quot; - see strftime(3) for details).

       Position value
              Alignment of the timestamp in the image. Possible value:

              ul = upper left,    ur = upper right,
              ll = lower left,    lr = lower right,
              uc = upper center,  lc = lower center

              (default: upper right). You can use either the short or  the  long
              version.

       Blend value
              Defines  the  blend  between  font  background  and  image (1-100,
              default: 60).

       BorderSize value
              value pixels will be used as border around  the  timestamp  string
              (1-255, default: 2).

FTP OPTIONS
       There  are  no options for ftp-upload on the command line. This is due to
       the need to provide a password which would be visible via the ps(1)  com&#8208;
       mand.

       EnableFtp On|Off
              Ftp-Connection  will  only  be  opened if set to On. Be aware that
              this might bring up a  dial-up  connection.  See  also  KeepAlive.
              (default: Off)

       RemoteHost hostname
              Host  to  which  a ftp-connection will be established everytime an
              image  has  been  written  (see   also:   Daemon,   DaemonSeconds,
              KeepAlive, default: camimage.jpg).

       RemoteDir path
              The  path  consists of the full path on the remote host defined by
              RemoteHost (default: /).

       RemoteImageName filename
              The filename consists of the full path and filename on the  remote
              host defined by RemoteHost (default: foo.bar.com).

       Username username
              The  name  of  the  user to log on the remote ftp-server (default:
              foo).

       Password password
              The password of the user to log on the remote ftp-server (default:
              bar).  Be  aware, that the password is kept unencrypted in memory,
              it might be read by others.

       KeepAlive On|Off
              If set to On, the connection will be kept. This will cause a dial-
              up  line  to  be  up all the time, which in turn may cost a lot of
              money! If set to Off, the connection will be established after  an
              image  was written to the OutputFile. After transmission, the ftp-
              connection will be ended.  This may also result in phone  charges,
              for which Author takes no responsibility. See License.

       Passive On|Off
              If  set  to On, passive ftp will be used. This can help connecting
              to ftp servers from the inside of a NAT-ed network.

       TryHarder On|Off
              Not implemented, yet.
&#12;HARDWARE SETTINGS
       With the following options you may alter the settings  of  your  hardware
       (the cam), if supported by the cam. Be aware, this might break your hard&#8208;
       ware, as there are no checks if the values supplied are  valid,  allowed,
       or supported!

       -W &lt;value&gt;
              Whiteness definition.

       -r &lt;value&gt;
              Color definition.

       -x &lt;value&gt;
              Contrast definition.

       -b &lt;value&gt;
              Brightness definition.

       -u &lt;value&gt;
              Hue definition.

BUGS
       At  my  own  machine running vgrabbj, the %F in a Archive-Filename causes
       memory corruption.  This is not validated by any other machine.  No  fur&#8208;
       ther bugs are known at this time.
