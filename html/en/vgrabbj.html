VGRABBJ(1)                                                            VGRABBJ(1)



NAME
       vgrabbj - grab images from a v4l-compatible webcam

SYNOPSIS
       vgrabbj [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the vgrabbj command.

       vgrabbj  is  a  program that will grab images from any v4l-capable device
       which supports one of the rgb24, rgb32, yuv420, yuv420p, yuyv, or  yuv422
       palettes and saves the image as a .jpg, .png, or .pnm file.

       Optional,  it  can  timestamp  the resulting image, and/or upload it to a
       ftp-server. Additionally, a daemon-mode is available to do the above reg&#8208;
       ularly.

       On  startup, the default configuration file /etc/vgrabbj.conf is read and
       evaluated. If a configuration file is specified via the -c parameter (see
       below),  that  file  is  read and parsed. Values which are present in the
       default config file keep their values.  Finally, the commandline is eval&#8208;
       uated. If an option is presented more than once, the last in the command&#8208;
       line is taken.  If no options given, vgrabbj tries to  open  the  default
       v4l-device /dev/video, grab an image and return it on /dev/stdout.  So be
       aware.

OPTIONS
       All options are either numeric values, strings, or booleans. If it  is  a
       boolean  switch (e.g. no value/string shown after the switch), it plainly
       switches the  current  setting  of  that  particular  option.   Remember,
       vgrabbj.conf  is read first, so any option set to on or off there will be
       toggled by the commandline switch.

       -h     Show summary of options and version number.  -c &lt;filename&gt;  Speci&#8208;
              fies filename as alternative configuration file.

       -l &lt;seconds&gt;
              Daemonize &amp; loop with seconds intervals (min. 1).

       -L &lt;microseconds&gt;
              Daemonize  &amp;  loop  microseconds  intervals  (min.  1). Same as -l
              except you can control it more precisely.

       -a     Enable vgrabbj&apos;s brightness adjustment (default: disabled). To use
              vgrabbj&apos;s  brightness  adjustment,  RGB24 support of the device is
              necessary. You may have to provide it to your device  via  the  -F
              parameter  (see  below).   If  your device does not support RGB24,
              this setting is silently ignored.

       -q &lt;quality&gt;
              Sets the quality of a jpeg output to quality (1-100, default: 75).

       -i &lt;imagesize&gt;
              Sets the imagesize of input device, where imagesize is one of:

               sqcif= 128x96,     qsif = 160x120,
               qcif = 176x144,    sif  = 320x240,
               cif  = 352x288,    vga  = 640x480,
               svga = 800x600,    xga  = 1024x768,
               sxga = 1280x1024,  uxga = 1600x1200,

              (default: cif)
&#12;       -w &lt;width&gt;
              Sets the width of the image to width. Needs  -H.   The  v4l-device
              has to support the image width you set with this option.

       -H &lt;height&gt;
              Sets  the height of the image to height. Needs -w.  The v4l-device
              has to support the image height you set with this option.

       -o &lt;format&gt;
              Sets the output to format (either  jpeg,  png,  or  pnm,  default:
              jpeg)

       -f &lt;filename&gt;
              Output is written to filename (default: /dev/stdout)

       -A &lt;path+filename&gt;
              Additional  to  the  output  of  -f another file is written to the
              named path+filename, whereas the whole may be formatted  according
              to strftime(2). This enables the creation of an archive of images.
              Currently, the output is only supported on the same filesystem  as
              the original output.

       -E &lt;value&gt;
              Defines how many images shall be read until a copy for the archive
              is made. E.g. 1 means each image taken is also put in the archive.
              5 would mean every fifth image taken is put in the archive.

       -M &lt;value&gt;
              Sets  the  maximum  number  of  images kept in the archive. If you
              defined 5 seconds for daemon mode, archive every image,  you  col&#8208;
              lect  720 images per hour. If you set this switch to 720 you would
              keep an hour of images in the archive.

       -d &lt;device&gt;
              Sets the input device to device (default: /dev/video)

       -s &lt;device&gt;
              This flag causes vgrabbj to print the v4l capabilities of &lt;device&gt;
              and exit.

       -C     Causes  vgrabbj  to  open  the  device  only  while  image data is
              grabbed.  This is helpful if you need access to the device besides
              vgrabbj.  It&apos;s  use  is  discouraged due to possible problems with
              memory fragmentation.  Default is  to  keep  the  v4l-device  open
              while vgrabbj is running.

       -g     Disables  setting of the image size (see -i, -H, and -w. Necessary
              for certain v4l-devices which do not support to be set to  a  par&#8208;
              ticular image size (e.g. IBM-usb-cam, QuickCam). For these devices
              you have to specify the size at module load time.

       -S     Switches colormap from BGR to RGB (or vice versa). Use if you have
              odd colors.

       -R     Swaps left and right of the image like a mirror.

       -U     Swaps  top and bottom of the image like a mirror (e.g. for upside-
              down montage of the cam).

       -G     Turns off use of mmap&apos;ed memory. see vgrabbj.conf(5) for details.

       -D &lt;value&gt;
              Sets the loglevel of vgrabbj. Valid for value are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
              (default:  4). 0 means no messages at all, 7 is debug. Don&apos;t use 7
              if you are running vgrabbj in daemon mode, it&apos;ll surely fill  your
              syslog.  Be  aware, that loglevel 7 will also write your ftp-pass&#8208;
              word (if defined in vgrabbj.conf(5)) in the logfile!

       -n     Disable the use of the temporary outputfile and write directly  to
              the output-file specified with -f. Output to /dev/stdout is always
              written directly without the use of a temporary file.

              If a filename different from /dev/stdout was  given  with  the  -f
              parameter,  vgrabbj  defaults to use a temporary file called file&#8208;
              name.tmp to write the image. This file is then renamed to filename
              to shorten the time period corrupt data may be read from filename.

       -F &lt;palette&gt;
              Force  the  usage of the specified palette. If palette is not sup&#8208;
              ported by either vgrabbj or the v4l-device, fallback to a  palette
              supported  by both is provided. If no common denominator is avail&#8208;
              able, vgrabbj exits. See DESCRIPTION for details on palettes  sup&#8208;
              ported by vgrabbj. Possible values are (copy from videodev.h):

               1  VIDEO_PALETTE_GREY      Linear greyscale
               2  VIDEO_PALETTE_HI240     High 240 cube (BT848)
               3  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB565    565 16 bit RGB
               4  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB24     24bit RGB
               5  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB32     32bit RGB
               6  VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB555    555 15bit RGB
               7  VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422    YUV422 capture
               8  VIDEO_PALETTE_YUYV
               9  VIDEO_PALETTE_UYVY
               10 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420
               10 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411    YUV411 capture
               11 VIDEO_PALETTE_RAW       RAW capture (BT848)
               12 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422P   YUV 4:2:2 Planar
               13 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411P   YUV 4:1:1 Planar
               14 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P   YUV 4:2:0 Planar
               15 VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV410P   YUV 4:1:0 Planar
               16 VIDEO_PALETTE_PLANAR
               17 VIDEO_PALETTE_COMPONENT

              (no default, depends on v4l-device)

       -z &lt;value&gt;
              value  images are grabbed and immediately discarded. Only the last
              image is written to the output. This might be helpful if your v4l-
              device needs to take a couple of images to auto-adjust to the cur&#8208;
              rent light.

       -X     Does not fork daemon process and keeps vgrabbj in daemon  mode  in
              foreground,  attached  to  the terminal. Useful for debugging pur&#8208;
              pose. Not available in config file.

HARDWARE CONTROL OPTIONS
       With the following options you can control the hardware settings of  your
       cam  -  if it is supported by your cam. Be aware that these options might
       break your hardware, as there is no check on what values  are  available,
       allowed, and supported by your hardware.

       -W &lt;value&gt;
              Whiteness definition.

       -r &lt;value&gt;
              Color definition.

       -x &lt;value&gt;
              Contrast definition.

       -b &lt;value&gt;
              Brightness definition.

       -u &lt;value&gt;
              Hue definition.
&#12;TIMESTAMP OPTIONS
       The following options are available only if vgrabbj was compiled with the
       freetype library available. If you set any one of these  options  on  the
       commandline  timestamp  will be enabled with default values for all other
       options.

       -e     Switches timestamp to be used or not. Default is off, but  may  be
              overridden  by  config-file,  so just try to enable this switch if
              there is no timestamp in the resulting image.

       -t &lt;filename&gt;
              The  TrueType  font  to  be  used  for  the   timestamp   (default
              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/Arialn.ttf)

       -T &lt;size&gt;
              Set the fontsize to size for timestamp (3-100, default: 12).

       -p &quot;&lt;format-str&gt;&quot;
              Defines  the  timestamp. format-str can be plain text or any strf&#8208;
              time format and has to be enclosed with &apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;  (default:  &quot;%a,  %e.
              %B %Y - %T&quot; - see strftime(3) for details)

       -P &lt;value&gt;
              Alignment of the timestamp in the image. Possible value:

              0 = upper left,    1 = upper right,
              2 = lower left,    3 = lower right,
              4 = upper center,  5 = lower center

              (default: 1).

       -m &lt;value&gt;
              Defines  the  blend  between  font  background  and  image (1-100,
              default: 60).

       -B &lt;value&gt;
              value pixels will be used as border around  the  timestamp  string
              (1-255, default: 2).

FTP OPTIONS
       There  are  no options for ftp-upload on the command line. This is due to
       the need to provide a password which would be visible via the ps(1)  com&#8208;
       mand.  See  vgrabbj.conf  for  details  on  how  to set-up the ftp-upload
       option.  Additionally, vgrabbj has to be compiled with libftp support.

BUGS
       %F in the archive time-string (year with century) causes  memory  corrup&#8208;
       tion  at  a  pentium-machine  running vgrabbj (not validated). No further
       bugs are known at this time.
