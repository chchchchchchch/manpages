VHANGUP(2)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 VHANGUP(2)



NAME
       vhangup - virtually hangup the current tty

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int vhangup(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       vhangup(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)

DESCRIPTION
       vhangup() simulates a hangup on the current terminal.  This call arranges
       for other users to have a &#8220;clean&#8221; tty at login time.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The  calling process has insufficient privilege to call vhangup();
              the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability is required.

CONFORMING TO
       This call is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs  intended
       to be portable.
