vim-addon-manager(1)                                        vim-addon-manager(1)



   [&quot;NAME&quot;]
       vim-addon-manager - command line manager of Vim add-ons

   [&quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;]
       vim-addons [OPTION ...] [COMMAND [ADDON ...]]

   [&quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;]
       Manage  Vim  addons  installed  system-wide, enabling on a per-user basis
       their installation, removal, ...

       vim-addons is capable of managing all Vim addons registered in  the  sys&#8208;
       tem-wide  registry  of Vim addons (see vim-registry(5)). Each system-wide
       addon can be, with respect to a user Vim configuration,  in  one  of  the
       following states:

       [&quot;installed&quot;]
              all  of  the  files  composing  the addon are installed (i.e. sym&#8208;
              linked) to their respective places under the target directory. The
              addon is fully functional for the current user

       [&quot;removed&quot;]
              the  files  composing the addon are not installed under the target
              directory.  The addon might still be working for the current  user
              if it is installed system-wide by the local administrator

       [&quot;disabled&quot;]
              the  files  composing the addon are not installed under the target
              directory, but the addon is installed  system-wide.  However,  the
              addon  has  been disabled for the current user explicitly via some
              configuration  line  in  plugin/vim-addons.vim  under  the  target
              directory. The addon is not working for the current user

       [&quot;broken&quot;]
              only some of the files composing the addon are installed under the
              target directory. The addon is probably not working for  the  cur&#8208;
              rent user

       [&quot;unavailable&quot;]
              some  (or  all)  of the files composing the addon are missing from
              the source directory

   [&quot;COMMANDS&quot;]
       A number of commands can be given to vim-addons to inspect or  alter  the
       status  of  the  addons:  list,  status, install, remove, disable, amend,
       files, show.

       A description of the semantics of each command is reported below.

       [&quot;list&quot;]
              list, one per line, the names of the addons available in the  sys&#8208;
              tem  (i.e. of all the addons mentioned in the registry, not neces&#8208;
              sarily of all enabled addons)

       [&quot;status&quot;]
              show, one per line, the status of the addons available in the sys&#8208;
              tem.  If  one  or more addon arguments are specified only show the
              status of those addons.  This is the default command if nothing is
              specified.

       [&quot;install&quot;]
              install one or more addons under the target directory. Requires at
              least one addon argument

       [&quot;remove&quot;]
              remove one or more addons from the target directory.  Requires  at
              least one addon argument

       [&quot;disable&quot;]
              disable one or more addons to be used by the current user. Usually
              used for addons which are system-wide enabled by the local  admin&#8208;
              istrator but that the current user does not want to be used. Using
              this command  will  automatically  change  the  content  of  plug&#8208;
              in/vim-addons.vim  under  the  target  directory,  probably adding
              &quot;:let&quot; commands which will inhibit  the  given  addon  from  being
              used.  Requires at least one addon argument

       [&quot;enable&quot;]
              undo  the effects of a previous disable command. Requires at least
              one addon argument

       [&quot;files&quot;]
              list, one per line, the  files  composing  the  specified  addons.
              Files  are  listed  relative  to components of the Vim runtimepath
              (see &apos;runtimepath&apos; in the Vim help). Requires at least  one  addon
              argument

       [&quot;show&quot;]
              displays detailed information about the specified addons

   [&quot;OPTIONS&quot;]
       All commands accept the following options:

       [&quot;\-h, \-\-help&quot;]
              show this usage message and exit

       [&quot;\-q, \-\-query&quot;]
              be quiet and make the output more parseable (for &quot;status&quot;)

       [&quot;\-r, \-\-registry\-dir&quot;]
              set the registry directory (default: /usr/share/vim/registry)

       [&quot;\-s, \-\-source\-dir&quot;]
              set the addons source directory (default: /usr/share/vim/addons)

       [&quot;\-t, \-\-target\-dir&quot;]
              set the addons target directory (default: $HOME/.vim)

       [&quot;\-v, \-\-verbose&quot;]
              increase verbosity level

       [&quot;\-z, \-\-silent&quot;]
              silent mode: supress most of the output

       [&quot;\-y, \-\-system\-dir&quot;]
              set     the     system-wide     target     directory     (default:
              /var/lib/vim/addons)

       [&quot;\-w, \-\-system\-wide&quot;]
              set the addons target directory to the system-wide  target  direc&#8208;
              tory, possibly overriding the -t option
