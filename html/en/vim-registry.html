vim-registry(5)                    vim addons                    vim-registry(5)



NAME
       vim-registry - syntax for vim-addons registry files

SYNOPSIS
       PACKAGE-NAME.yaml

DESCRIPTION
       A registry file is a multi-document YAML file (i.e. it can be composed by
       several different YAML documents separated by  &#8220;---&#8221;  lines).  Each  YAML
       document  represents a registry entry, that is the information describing
       a single addon.

       Ideally, the registry directory contains one file  per  package  shipping
       addons;  with  a  filename  obeying  to the convention PACKAGE-NAME.yaml.
       Hence a single package can  contribute  to  the  registry  with  multiple
       entries described in a single YAML file.

       For   example,   the   &#8220;vim-scripts&#8221;   package   should   ship  a  single
       /usr/share/vim/registry/vim-scripts.yaml file, containing one YAML  docu&#8208;
       ment  per  shipped  addon. The first lines of such file can look like the
       following:

           addon: alternate
           description: &quot;alternate pairing files (e.g. .c/.h) with short ex-commands&quot;
           basedir: /usr/share/vim-scripts/
           disabledby: &quot;let loaded_alternateFile = 1&quot;
           files:
             - plugin/a.vim
             - doc/alternate.txt
           ---
           addon: whatdomain
           description: &quot;query the meaning of a Top Level Domain&quot;
           basedir: /usr/share/vim-scripts/
           disabledby: &quot;let loaded_whatdomain = 1&quot;
           files:
             - plugin/whatdomain.vim
           ---

       Each registry entry may contain  the  following  fields,  to  be  typeset
       according to the YAML specification:

       addon (Required)
              Name of the addon.

       description (Required)
              Human understandable textual description of the addon.

       files (Required)
              List  of  the files which compose the addon and are required to be
              present in a component of the Vim runtime path for the addon to be
              enabled.   Each  file  is specified relative to a component of the
              Vim runtime path.

       basedir (Optional)
              Directory where the files shipped by the addon  (i.e.,  where  the
              symlinks  of  the  user/sysadm  should  point  to)  reside  on the
              filesystem.  Default is /usr/share/vim/addons.

       disabledby (Optional)
              Vim script command that can be  used  (usually  by  adding  it  to
              ~/.vimrc)  to  prevent  the  addon from being used even when it is
              installed.  The intended usage of this field is to &#8220;blacklist&#8221;  an
              undesired addon whose files are available, and hence automatically
              loaded by Vim, in a component of the Vim runtime path.
