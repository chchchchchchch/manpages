VIMDOT(1)                                                              VIMDOT(1)



NAME
       vimdot - Combined text editor and dot viewer

SYNOPSIS
       vimdot [file]

DESCRIPTION
       vimdot  is  a  simple  script which launches the gvim or vim editor along
       with a GUI window showing the dot output of the  edited  file.   The  dot
       output  window automatically refreshes everytime the file is saved in the
       editor.

       If no filename is given, vimdot will use &apos;noname.dot&apos; and  initialise  it
       with an example graph to get you started.

SEE ALSO
       vim(1), dot(1)
