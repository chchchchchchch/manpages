VISGREP(1)                                                            VISGREP(1)



NAME
       visgrep - Visual grep, greps for images in another image

SYNOPSIS
       visgrep [options] image.png detect.pat match.pat ...

DESCRIPTION
       visgrep is a program that greps for image in another image.

       All  .pat files are created using png2pat(1) or rgb2pat(1). The image.png
       is scanned for detect.pat starting from X,Y given  in  parameters.   When
       detect.pat  is found, then all the match.pat files are scanned at an off&#8208;
       set of x,y given in parameters. If a match is found, then visgrep  prints
       the x,y and index of the item.

       For  example,  image.png is a screenshot and match1.pat .. match5.pat are
       images of letters a to e. Each of these letters is  enclosed  in  a  blue
       box,  so detect.pat is an image of the upper left corner of the box. This
       box is not included in the match*.pat files, so they are actually  offset
       5 pixels down and 4 pixels to the left.  You might run it like this then:

         visgrep -x-4 -y5 image.png match_corner.pat match_a.pat match_b.bat ...

       Etc,  with  all matches listed. Now suppose the screen showed ace so vis&#8208;
       grep might output:

         10,10 0
         50,10 2
         90,10 4

       Showing that match_a.pat (index 0) is at 10,10 on the screen. If no match
       is found even though the detection image is found, the index will be -1.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -x     Set x offset for detection matching.

       -y     Set y offset for detection matching.

       -X     Start scanning at X.

       -Y     Start scanning at Y.

       -t     Set  tolerance for &apos;fuzzy&apos; matches, higher numbers are more toler&#8208;
              ant.

       0      at least one match was made.

       1      no matches were made.
