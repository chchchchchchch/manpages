VLNA(1)                                                                  VLNA(1)



NAME
       vlna - adds tilde after each non-syllabic preposition

USAGE
       vlna [options] [filenames]

PREFACE
       There  exists  a  special Czech and Slovak typographical rule: you cannot
       leave the non-syllabic preposition on the end of one  line  and  continue
       writting  text  on next line. For example, you cannot write down the text
       &quot;v lese&quot; (in a forest) like &quot;v&lt;new-line&gt;lese&quot;. The program vlna adds  the
       asciitilde  between  such  preposition  and the next word and removes the
       space(s) in this place.  It means,  the  program  converts  &quot;v  lese&quot;  to
       &quot;v~lese&quot;.  You  can  use  this  program  as a preporcessor before TeXing.
       Moreower, you can set another sequence to store instead  asciitilte  (see
       the -x option).

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  vlna processes one or more files, searches the non-syllabic
       prepositions followed by space(s) in these files and converts  this/these
       space(s) to asciitilde for each such occurrence.

       In  the processed file, the activity of the program can be blocked by %~-
       sequence and the activity can be restored  again  by  the  %~+  sequence.
       These  sequences  can  include  spaces,  it  means that % ~- is a correct
       sequence too.

       The rule to recognize a preposition  follows:  The  arbitrary  number  of
       opening  parentheses  can  be  written  before the preposition and before
       these (optional) parentheses must be the space,  tabelator  or  new-line.
       The  preposition  itself  is one-letter word, the letters have to be from
       this set: {KkSsVvZzOoUuAI}. See the -v option if you want to change  this
       set  of letters. From version 1.2, the TeX sequence can be written before
       preposition and  before  the  brace.  Example:  &quot;&lt;new-line&gt;([V  lese&quot;  is
       converted  to  &quot;&lt;new-line&gt;([V~lese&quot;.   Another  example: &quot;\uv{V lese}&quot; is
       converted to &quot;\uv{V~lese}&quot;.

       One or more blank-spaces have to be  included  after  preposition  before
       next  word. The blank-space means space or tabelator.  One &lt;new-line&gt; can
       be here too.  All these characters are removed and replaced by asciitilde
       (or  by another string, see -x option). If &lt;new-line&gt; is deleted, another
       &lt;new-line&gt;  is  created   before   preposition   (and   before   optional
       parentheses) in order to the number of lines is kept unchanged.  Example:
       &quot;... V&lt;new-line&gt;&lt;tabelator&gt;lese&quot; is converted to &quot;...&lt;new-line&gt;V~lese&quot;.

       The program checks the consintence of  TeX&apos;s  math  environments  (if  -m
       option  isn&apos;t  used). For example the &quot;$...$$...$&quot; sequence (it means the
       display mode switch inside the text-math mode) generates a warning. Empty
       line  inside  display  mode  generates  a  warning  too  and  the program
       processes next text like in normal (non-math) mode. The existence of  the
       &quot;$&quot;  inside  display  mode  are  accepted  because the constructions like
       $$..\hbox{..$..$}..$$ are allowed and common.

       The consistence of verbatim mode is checked on the end of the  file.   If
       the  file ends but the verbatim mode does not end the warning is printed.
       This behavior can be switched off by -n or -w options.

       The program suppresses the tilde changing after letters like prepositions
       but  they  are  not  prepositions  because  the  \TeX  or \LaTeX sequence
       precedes.  Example:  &quot;vlastnosti  \TeX  u  jsou&quot;  is  not  converted   to
       &quot;vlastnosti  \TeX  u~jsou&quot;,  because  this  text  is  printed  (after TeX
       processing) like &quot;vlastnosti TeXu jsou&quot;. The letter &quot;u&quot; is a suffix here,
       no preposition.

OPTIONS
       The options are optional and can be written in arbitrarty order separated
       by space.

       -f     Filter. The [filenames] are treated as follows:

              vlna -f filename1 filename2
                  Input is filename1, output is filename2.

              vlna -f filename1
                  Input is filename1, output is stdout.

              vlna -f
                  Input is stdin, output is stdout.

              vlna filename1 [filename2 [filename3 ...]]
                  If the -f option  is  omitted  then  each  file  is  processed
                  independently and it is re-written.

       -s     The  silent  mode.  No messages, warnings, statistics are printed.
              Only errors which terminates the program untimely are printed.  If
              this parameter is omitted then banner, warnings and statistics are
              printed to stderr.

       -r     Do not create the backups. The option -r is irrelevant if  the  -f
              option is used. If the -f and -r options aren&apos;t used then each re-
              written file is stored with its original contents to a backup file
              (the  name  of backup file is the same as filename, only the tilde
              is used instead of the last character).

       -v characters
              The set of characters  treated  as  non-syllabic  prepositions  is
              declared  by  this  option. Default: -v KkSsVvZzOoUuAI.  The space
              between -v and characters is required.

       -x code
              The code is a string written in hexadecimal  notation  (even  hexa
              digits  is required). This string will be saved after prepositions
              instead asciitilde which is default.  The  example:  -x  C2A0  two
              bytes  are  stored after each non-syllabic preposition, first byte
              has C2 code and second byte has A0 code. This example  means  that
              NO-BREAK  SPACE  in UTF8 encoding will be used after prepositions.
              Another example: -x 00A0 the NO-BREAK  SPACE  in  UTF16  encoding.
              Another example: -x 48454C4C4F the string HELLO will be used.  The
              space between -x and code is required.

       -m     The math-modes ($...$ and $$...$$) are  ignored.   It  means  that
              non-syllabic  prepositions  is searched in math-mode too.  Default
              (without -m option): no changes in math  modes  are  done  because
              (for example) &quot;v&quot; is variable in math-mode, no preposition.

       -n     The   verbatim  mode  (\verb&lt;char&gt;...&lt;char&gt;,  \begtt...\endtt)  is
              ignored, it means  the  program  can  do  a  changes  in  verbatim
              environment.   Default (without -n option): no changes in verbatim
              mode are done.

       -l     The LaTeX mode. The following environments are treated as  display
              mode:              \begin{display}...\end{display}             and
              \begin{equation}...\end{equation} and the following environment is
              treated as verbatim mode: \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}.

       -w     The  web mode (Knuth&apos;s web, no www:-). The following sequences are
              treated as verbatim: @&lt;, @d...@*, @space or @&gt;|.  It means program
              code  is  unchanged  in  *.w or *.web files, only web-comments are
              processed.

EXAMPLES
       vlna -m -n -s -r file
              The program has a behavior similar to the old vlnka program.

       vlna *.tex
              All files with .tex suffix in current directory will be  processed
              (and possibly changed). (The &quot;*&quot; is UNIX-shell feautre).

       vlna -f file &gt; /dev/null
              Only  the  consistence  checking  of  math  and  verbatim modes is
              processed.  No changes are done.
