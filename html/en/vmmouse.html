DESCRIPTION
       vmmouse  is  an  XFree86 input driver for mice.  The driver supports most
       available mouse types and interfaces.  USB mice  are  only  supported  on
       some OSs, and the level of support for PS/2 mice depends on the OS.

       The  vmmouse  driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
       as the X server&apos;s core pointer.  Multiple mice are supported by  multiple
       instances of this driver.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer  to  xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only  cov&#8208;
       ers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver will automatically detect if the vmmouse device is present and
       if it is not, it will load the regular mouse driver and attempt  to  fall
       back  to  it.  There  are  no  vmmouse  specific  options, but if you set
       mouse(4) options, they will be passed on.

       See the mouse(4) man page for details on these options.
