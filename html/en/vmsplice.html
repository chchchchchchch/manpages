VMSPLICE(2)                 Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                VMSPLICE(2)



NAME
       vmsplice - splice user pages into a pipe

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;

       ssize_t vmsplice(int fd, const struct iovec *iov,
                        unsigned long nr_segs, unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  vmsplice()  system call maps nr_segs ranges of user memory described
       by iov into a pipe.  The file descriptor fd must refer to a pipe.

       The pointer iov points to an array of  iovec  structures  as  defined  in
       &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;:

           struct iovec {
               void  *iov_base;            /* Starting address */
               size_t iov_len;             /* Number of bytes */
           };

       The  flags argument is a bit mask that is composed by ORing together zero
       or more of the following values:

       SPLICE_F_MOVE      Unused for vmsplice(); see splice(2).

       SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK  Do  not  block  on  I/O;  see  splice(2)  for  further
                          details.

       SPLICE_F_MORE      Currently  has  no  effect  for vmsplice(), but may be
                          implemented in the future; see splice(2).

       SPLICE_F_GIFT      The user pages are a gift to the kernel.  The applica&#8208;
                          tion  may  not  modify this memory ever, or page cache
                          and on-disk data may differ.   Gifting  pages  to  the
                          kernel means that a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE
                          can successfully move the pages; if this flag  is  not
                          specified,  then  a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE
                          must copy the pages.  Data must also be properly  page
                          aligned, both in memory and length.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, vmsplice() returns the number of bytes trans&#8208;
       ferred to the pipe.  On error, vmsplice() returns -1 and errno is set  to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd either not valid, or doesn&apos;t refer to a pipe.

       EINVAL nr_segs  is  0  or  greater than IOV_MAX; or memory not aligned if
              SPLICE_F_GIFT set.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

VERSIONS
       The vmsplice() system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.17;  library  sup&#8208;
       port was added to glibc in version 2.5.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.
&#12;NOTES
       vmsplice() follows the other vectorized read/write type functions when it
       comes to limitations on number of segments being passed in.   This  limit
       is  IOV_MAX  as defined in &lt;limits.h&gt;.  At the time of this writing, that
       limit is 1024.
