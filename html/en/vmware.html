DESCRIPTION
       vmware is an Xorg driver for VMware virtual video cards.

MODESETTING, XINERAMA AND RANDR12
       If the driver can connect to the &quot;vmwgfx&quot; kernel module on linux, it will
       attempt to use kernel modesetting and will then also use RandR12 for mul&#8208;
       tiple  output  operation  instead  of  Xinerama.  The X server log or the
       &quot;xrandr&quot; application can be used to determine whether RandR12 or Xinerama
       is actually used.

3D ACCELERATION
       If the driver can connect to the &quot;vmwgfx&quot; kernel module on linux, and the
       Virtual Machine is set up to use 3D acceleration, the driver will try  to
       use  Gallium3D  XA  to  accelerate 3D operations. It will also by default
       enable DRI, the Direct Rendering Infrastructure, primarily  for  acceler&#8208;
       ated  OpenGL.   If 3D acceleration is available, the driver will in addi&#8208;
       tion provide an additional XVideo adaptor for textured  video.  Gallium3D
       XA,ibxatracker.so&quot;  and the accelerated OpenGL driver, &quot;vmwgfx_dri.so&quot; is
       provided by the mesa distribution.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the version of any virtual VMware SVGA adapter.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;Xinerama&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disable  or  enable Xinerama support. Default: xinerama is enabled
              if the hardware supports it.

       Option &quot;StaticXinerama&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              Provide a static xinerama geometry that will be active  at  server
              startup  and  will  not  be  overridden at runtime.  The format is
              &quot;Width1xHeight1+Xoffset1+Yoffset1;Width2xHeight2+Xoffset2+Yoff&#8208;
              set2&quot; and so on. Negative offsets are not supported. If the driver
              is using RandR12, this option should be used to place  and  enable
              outputs  at  driver  startup time or else when VMware tools is not
              used for that purpose.  Also please see option &quot;GuiLayout&quot;.

       Option &quot;GuiLayout&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              A synonym to option &quot;StaticXinerama&quot;, since  the  latter  name  is
              somewhat misleading when RandR12 is favoured before Xinerarma.

       Option &quot;AddDefaultMode&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Provide  a default mode with a resolution identical to the resolu&#8208;
              tion of the guest before the X server was started.  The  X  server
              will thus try to start without changing resolution. Default: on.

       Option &quot;RenderAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Try  to accelerate render operations if the operations are reading
              from previously accelerated contents (3D or video). This option is
              needed  for  3D  support.  Default:  on if 3D acceleration is sup&#8208;
              ported. Otherwise off.

       Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable the Direct Rendering  Infrastructure.  Default:  on  if  3D
              acceleration  is supported and &quot;RenderAccel&quot; is enabled. Otherwise
              off.

       Option &quot;DirectPresents&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Speed up OpenGL swapbuffers by skipping  a  copy  operation.  This
              provides  some  OpenGL  swapbuffer speedups, but may cause perfor&#8208;
              mance degradation and rendering errors when 3D  contents  is  read
              back for mixing with software rendered contents. Default: off.

       Option &quot;HwPresents&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  is  a developer convenience option and should not be used by
              distros or normal users. When enabled, it copies software rendered
              contents to a 3D surface before presenting it, so that the visible
              screen is always present on a 3D surface. Default: off.

       Option &quot;RenderCheck&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This is a developer convenience option and should not be  used  by
              distros or normal users. When enabled, it tries to use 3D acceler&#8208;
              ation for all XRender operations where  3D  acceleration  is  sup&#8208;
              ported,  resulting in a considerable slowdown due to the increased
              number of readbacks of accelerated contents from  host  to  guest.
              This  option  is used to verify that the accelerated Xrender paths
              works correctly with the &quot;rendercheck&quot; application. Default: off.
