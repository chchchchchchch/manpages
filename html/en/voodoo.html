       voodoo - Voodoo video driver

DESCRIPTION
       voodoo is an Xorg driver for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 series video adapters.
       On the Voodoo 1 the driver uses a shadow buffer in system memory  as  the
       video  adapter  has only 3D acceleration. Selected portions of the shadow
       framebuffer are copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because
       of this, the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. Processors
       nowadays are actually rather fast at moving data  so  we  get  very  good
       speed anyway as the shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.

       The  Voodoo2  has  16bpp acceleration and the driver provides accelerated
       versions of most operations except angled lines and stipples. Accelerated
       alpha blending with the Render extension is also supported as is DGA.

       This  driver  supports 16bpp modes currently. The video hardware supports
       image conversion from 24bpp to 16bpp but the hardware is 16bpp only.

       The Voodoo 1 series cards can go  up  to  800x600  resolution  while  the
       Voodoo 2 can reach 1024x768 providing it has at least 2Mb of frame buffer
       memory. 1024x768 2D mode does not require two cards configured  in  scan-
       line interleave mode (SLI).

       Multihead  and  Xinerama configurations are supported. SLI configurations
       will be treated as multiple video cards.

       Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available.  The  &quot;standby&quot;  and
       &quot;suspend&quot;  modes are just painting the screen black. The &quot;off&quot; mode turns
       the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.

       This driver does not support a virtual screen  size  different  from  the
       display  size.  This  is  a hardware limitation. 3D rendering is also not
       supported.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for  general  configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enables  a  shadow buffer in main memory. This turns off accelera&#8208;
              tion but for otherwise unaccelerated operations can  improve  per&#8208;
              formance materially.  Default: off for voodoo2, on for voodoo1.

       Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables  acceleration if set. Unless debugging this option should
              only be set if ShadowFB is enabled.  Default: off for voodoo2,  on
              for voodoo1.

BUGS
       The driver interacts badly with the sstfb frame buffer driver as there is
       insufficient information to restore the chip to its previous state.
