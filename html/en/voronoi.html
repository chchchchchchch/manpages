voronoi(6x)                    XScreenSaver manual                   voronoi(6x)



NAME
       voronoi - draws a randomly-colored Voronoi tessellation

SYNOPSIS
       voronoi [-display host:display.screen] [-visual visual] [-window] [-root]
       [-points int] [-point-size int] [-point-speed ratio]  [-point-delay  sec&#8208;
       onds] [-zoom-speed ratio] [-zoom-delay seconds] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       Draws  a randomly-colored Voronoi tessellation, and periodically zooms in
       and adds new points.  The existing points also wander around.

       There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center  of  a
       colored cell.  Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell&apos;s con&#8208;
       trol point than to any other control point.  That is what determines  the
       cell&apos;s shapes.

       When  running  in  a  window, you can click  to insert a new point at the
       mouse position.  Clicking on an existing point lets you drag it around.

       This implementation takes advantage of the OpenGL depth buffer to compute
       the  cells  for us, by rendering the intersection of overlapping cones in
       an orthographic plane.

OPTIONS
       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a vis&#8208;
               ual  class,  or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific vis&#8208;
               ual.

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -points int
               How many points to add each time we zoom in.

       -point-size int
               How big to draw the stars, in pixels.  0 for no stars.

       -point-speed ratio
               How fast the points should  wander.   Less  than  1  for  slower,
               greater than 1 for faster.

       -point-delay seconds
               How quickly to insert new points, when adding.

       -zoom-speed ratio
               How  fast to zoom in.  Less than 1 for slower, greater than 1 for
               faster.

       -zoom-delay seconds
               Zoom in every this-many seconds.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource  file  that  overrides  the  global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
