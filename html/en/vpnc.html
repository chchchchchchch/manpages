NAME
       vpnc - client for Cisco VPN3000 Concentrator, IOS and PIX

SYNOPSIS
       vpnc  [--version] [--print-config] [--help] [--long-help] [options] [con&#8208;
       fig files]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the vpnc and vpnc-disconnect commands.

       vpnc is a VPN client for the Cisco 3000 VPN  Concentrator,   creating   a
       IPSec-like connection as a tunneling network device for the local system.
       It uses the TUN/TAP driver in  Linux  kernel  2.4  and  above  and device
       tun(4) on BSD. The created connection is presented as a tunneling network
       device to the local system.

       OBLIGATORY WARNING: the most  used  configuration  (XAUTH  authentication
       with  pre-shared keys and password authentication) is insecure by design,
       be aware of this fact when you use vpnc to exchange sensitive  data  like
       passwords!

       The  vpnc  daemon  by  itself  does  not  set  any  routes,  but it calls
       vpnc-script to do this job. vpnc-script displays a connect banner. If the
       concentrator  supplies  a network list for split-tunneling these networks
       are added to the routing table.  Otherwise the default-route will be mod&#8208;
       ified  to  point to the tunnel.  Further a host route to the concentrator
       is added in the later case.  If the client host needs DHCP, care must  be
       taken to add another host route to the DHCP-Server around the tunnel.

       The  vpnc-disconnect  command  is used to terminate the connection previ&#8208;
       ously created by vpnc and restore the previous routing configuration.


CONFIGURATION
       The daemon reads configuration data from the following places:
       &#183;      command line options
       &#183;      config file(s) specified on the command line
       &#183;      /etc/vpnc/default.conf
       &#183;      /etc/vpnc.conf
       &#183;      prompting the user if not found above

       vpnc can parse options and configuration files in any order. However  the
       first  place to set an option wins.  configuration filenames which do not
       contain a / will be searched at /etc/vpnc/&lt;filename&gt; and /etc/vpnc/&lt;file&#8208;
       name&gt;.conf.   Otherwise  &lt;filename&gt; and &lt;filename&gt;.conf will be used.  If
       no configuration file is specified  on  the  command-line  at  all,  both
       /etc/vpnc/default.conf and /etc/vpnc.conf will be loaded.

OPTIONS
       The program options can be either given as arguments (but not all of them
       for security reasons) or be stored in a configuration file.

              Default: Yes
       conf-variable: DNSUpdate

       --target-networks
              DEPRECATED extension, see README.Debian for details
              Default:
       conf-variable: Target Networks

       --print-config
              Prints your configuration; output can be used as vpnc.conf

FILES
       /etc/vpnc.conf /etc/vpnc/default.conf
              The  default  configuration  file. You can specify the same config
              directives as with command line  options  and  additionally  IPSec
              secret  and  Xauth  password  both supplying a cleartext password.
              Scrambled passwords from the Cisco configuration profiles  can  be
              used with IPSec obfuscated secret and Xauth obfuscated password.

              See EXAMPLES for further details.

       /etc/vpnc/*.conf
              vpnc will read configuration files in this directory when the con&#8208;
              fig filename (with or without .conf) is specified on  the  command
              line.


EXAMPLES
       This is an example vpnc.conf with pre-shared keys:

              IPSec gateway vpn.example.com
              IPSec ID ExampleVpnPSK
              IKE Authmode psk
              IPSec secret PskS3cret!
              Xauth username user@example.com
              Xauth password USecr3t

       And  another one with hybrid authentication (requires that vpnc was built
       with openssl support):

              IPSec gateway vpn.example.com
              IPSec ID ExampleVpnHybrid
              IKE Authmode hybrid
              CA-Dir /etc/vpnc
              or
              CA-File /etc/vpnc/vpn-example-com.pem
              IPSec secret HybS3cret?
              Xauth username user@example.com
              Xauth password 123456

       The lines begin with a keyword (no leading spaces!).   The  values  start
       exactly  one  space  after the keywords, and run to the end of line. This
       lets you put any kind of weird character (except CR, LF and NUL) in  your
       strings,  but it does mean you can&apos;t add comments after a string, or spa&#8208;
       ces before them.

       In case the the CA-Dir option is used, your certificate needs to be named
       something  like 722d15bd.X, where X is a manually assigned number to make
       sure that files with colliding hashes have different  names.  The  number
       can be derived from the certificate file itself:

       openssl x509 -subject_hash -noout -in /etc/vpnc/vpn-example-com.pem

       See  also  the  --print-config  option to generate a config file, and the
       example file in the package documentation directory where  more  advanced
       usage is demonstrated.

       Advanced  features like manual setting of multiple target routes and dis&#8208;
       abling /etc/resolv.conf rewriting is documented in the README of the vpnc
       package.
