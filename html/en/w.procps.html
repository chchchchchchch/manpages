W(1)                              User Commands                             W(1)



NAME
       w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

SYNOPSIS
       w [options] user [...]

DESCRIPTION
       w  displays  information  about  the  users currently on the machine, and
       their processes.  The header shows, in this order, the current time,  how
       long the system has been running, how many users are currently logged on,
       and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

       The following entries are displayed for each user: login  name,  the  tty
       name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command
       line of their current process.

       The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.   It
       does not include past background jobs, but does include currently running
       background jobs.

       The PCPU time is the time used by  the  current  process,  named  in  the
       &quot;what&quot; field.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -h, --no-header
              Don&apos;t print the header.

       -u, --no-current
              Ignores  the  username  while figuring out the current process and
              cpu times.  To demonstrate this, do a &quot;su&quot; and do a &quot;w&quot; and  a  &quot;w
              -u&quot;.

       -s, --short
              Use  the  short  format.  Don&apos;t print the login time, JCPU or PCPU
              times.

       -f, --from
              Toggle printing the from (remote hostname) field.  The default  as
              released  is  for  the from field to not be printed, although your
              system administrator or distribution maintainer may have  compiled
              a version in which the from field is shown by default.

       --help Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -o, --old-style
              Old style output.  Prints blank space for idle times less than one
              minute.
