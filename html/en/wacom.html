DESCRIPTION
       wacom is an X input driver for Wacom devices.

       The wacom driver functions as a pointer input device.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This  driver  supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets
       only need this driver.  USB tablet support is  available  on  some  Linux
       platforms  and  requires the wacom kernel driver being loaded before this
       driver starts.

       Please check  http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net  for  latest  updates  of
       Wacom X and kernel drivers.

DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING
       When  input device hotplugging in the X server is enabled and no InputDe&#8208;
       vice section exists for a compatible tablet device and an InputClass sec&#8208;
       tion  (see xorg.conf.d(5x)) assigns this driver for the device, the wacom
       driver creates multiple X devices for  each  a  physical  device,  one  X
       device  for each available tool. The list of tools is hardware-dependent.
       See Option Type as outlined in the CONFIGURATION DETAILS section.

       These tool-specific devices are referred to as parent device  and  depen&#8208;
       dent  device.   The  parent device is the one presented by the system and
       the one that causes the X server to load the wacom  driver.  This  parent
       device  then  causes the automatic addition of several dependent devices.
       If the parent device is unplugged or  otherwise  removed,  the  dependent
       devices will be automatically removed as well.

       Dependent  devices  may  be  assigned tool-specific options through addi&#8208;
       tional InputClass sections. We recommend that a MatchDriver wacom line is
       used in these sections in addition to the user-specific pattern.

       Match  directives  are  applied  by  the  X  server  before the driver is
       selected.  The type name of the parent device is appended by the  driver.
       It  is not possible to use a MatchProduct directive to match against this
       appended type name.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) or xorg.conf.d(5x) for  general  configura&#8208;
       tion  details  and  for  options that can be used with all input drivers.
       This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. Each device supports
       the following entries:

               Option &quot;Type&quot; &quot;stylus&quot;|&quot;eraser&quot;|&quot;cursor&quot;|&quot;pad&quot;|&quot;touch&quot;
                   sets  the  type of tool the device represents. This option is
                   mandatory.  The core options,  such  as  &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot;  or
                   &quot;AlwaysCore&quot;,  are  unnecessary  in Gimp if you don&apos;t need to
                   move system cursor outside of Gimp drawing  area.   &quot;pad&quot;  is
                   for  Intuos  3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet ExpressKeys/menu strips,
                   and Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, and/or  ring.
                   It  is required  for Intuos3,  CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and Bam&#8208;
                   boo if you want to use keystroke features.  &quot;pad&quot; is reported
                   as  a  second  tool  in the driver. &quot;touch&quot; is for the tablet
                   with touch support.  Right now only a  few  Tablet  PCs  have
                   this feature.

               Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;path&quot;
                   sets  the  path  to  the special file which represents serial
                   line where the tablet is plugged.  You have to specify it for
                   each  subsection with the same value if you want to have mul&#8208;
                   tiple devices with the same tablet.  This  option  is  manda&#8208;
                   tory.

               Option &quot;Suppress&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets the position increment under which not to transmit coor&#8208;
                   dinates.  This entry must be  specified  only  in  the  first
                   Wacom subsection if you have multiple devices for one tablet.
                   If you don&apos;t specify this entry, the default value,  which is
                   2,  will be used. To disable suppression, the entry should be
                   specified as 0.  When suppress is defined,  an event will  be
                   sent  only  when  at least one of the following conditions is
                   met:

                           the change between the current X coordinate  and  the
                   previous one is greater than suppress;

                           the  change  between the current Y coordinate and the
                   previous one is greater than suppress;

                           the change between the current pressure and the  pre&#8208;
                   vious one is greater than suppress;

                           the  change  between  the  current degree of rotation
                   and the previous one of the transducer is greater  than  sup&#8208;
                   press;

                           the  change  between the current absolute wheel value
                   and the previous one is equal to or greater than suppress;

                           the change between the current  tilt  value  and  the
                   previous one is equal to or greater than suppress (if tilt is
                   supported);

                           relative wheel value has changed;

                           button value has changed;

                           proximity has changed.

               Option &quot;Mode&quot; &quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot;
                   sets the mode of the device.  The default value  for  stylus,
                   pad  and  eraser  is  Absolute;  cursor  is  Relative;  touch
                   defaults to Relative for tablets with touch pads and Absolute
                   for touch screens.

               Option &quot;TopX&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   X  coordinate  of the top corner of the active zone.  Default
                   to 0.

               Option &quot;TopY&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   Y coordinate of the top corner of the active  zone.   Default
                   to 0.

               Option &quot;BottomX&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   X  coordinate  of  the  bottom  corner  of  the  active zone.
                   Default to width of the tablet.

               Option &quot;BottomY&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   Y coordinate  of  the  bottom  corner  of  the  active  zone.
                   Default to height of the tablet.

               Option &quot;ButtonsOnly&quot; &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
                   disables the device&apos;s motion events.  Default to off.

               Option &quot;ButtonM&quot; &quot;AC&quot;
                   reports  an  action  AC when button M is pressed,  where M is
                   one of the device supported  button numbers,  it can be 1  to
                   32.  Wacom  uses  a driver-internal button mapping, where any
                   physical button appears to the X server as the button  speci&#8208;
                   fied  by  the ButtonM mapping. Hence, if two physical buttons
                   have the same ButtonM mapping, the server will think they are
                   the same physical button.  The default action reported to the
                   X server is mouse button M click. Because X uses  buttons  4,
                   5,  6,  and 7 as the four scrolling directions, physical but&#8208;
                   tons 4 and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default.   To
                   ignore the button click, i.e., to not report any button click
                   event to the X server,  use &quot;0&quot; or &quot;button 0&quot;.

               Option &quot;TPCButton&quot; &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
                   enables the stylus buttons as Tablet PC buttons. If  enabled,
                   the  stylus  reports  button  events  only  when  its  tip is
                   pressed. If any button is down, pressing the  tip  reports  a
                   button  event for the button. Otherwise if no button is down,
                   the tip reports as usual.  Default to &quot;on&quot;  for  Tablet  PCs;
                   &quot;off&quot;  for  all  other  models.  Only available on the stylus
                   tool.

               Option &quot;Touch&quot; &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
                   enables the touch event for Tablet  PC  that  supports  touch
                   feature,   i.e.,  system  cursor  moves when user touches the
                   tablet.  Default to &quot;on&quot; for Tablet PCs with  touch  feature;
                   &quot;off&quot; for all other models.

               Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;|&quot;CCW&quot;|&quot;HALF&quot;|&quot;NONE&quot;
                   rotates  the  tablet  orientation  counterclockwise  (CCW) or
                   clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees (HALF).  If you  have  specific
                   tablet  mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the map&#8208;
                   ping will  be  applied  before  rotation.  Rotation  must  be
                   applied  to  the parent device (usually the stylus), rotation
                   settings on in-driver hotplugged devices (see DRIVER-INTERNAL
                   DEVICE HOTPLUGGING ) will be ignored. The default is &quot;NONE&quot;.

               Option &quot;PressCurve&quot; &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot;
                   sets  pressure  curve  by  control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.
                   Their values are in range from 0..100. The pressure curve  is
                   interpreted  as Bezier curve with 4 control points, the first
                   and the last control point being fixed on the coordinates 0/0
                   and  100/100,  respectively.  The  middle  control points are
                   adjustible by this setting and thus define the shape  of  the
                   curve.    The   input   for   linear   curve   (default)   is
                   &quot;0,0,100,100&quot;; slightly depressed  curve  (firmer)  might  be
                   &quot;5,0,100,95&quot;;   slightly   raised  curve  (softer)  might  be
                   &quot;0,5,95,100&quot;.  The  pressure  curve  is  only  applicable  to
                   devices  of type stylus or eraser, other devices do not honor
                   this setting.

               Option &quot;DebugLevel&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets the level of debugging info for tool-specific  messages.
                   There  are 12 levels, specified by the integers between 1 and
                   12.  All debug messages with a level less than  or  equal  to
                   the  &quot;number&quot;  will  be  logged  into the Xorg log file. This
                   option is only available if the driver was built with  debug&#8208;
                   ging support.
&#12;               Option &quot;CommonDBG&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets  the  level of debugging info for common (i.e. not tool-
                   specific) code paths on the  tablet.  There  are  12  levels,
                   specified  by  the  integers between 1 and 12. All debug mes&#8208;
                   sages with a level less than or equal to the &quot;number&quot; will be
                   logged  into the Xorg log file. This option is only available
                   if the driver was built with debugging support.

               Option &quot;CursorProx&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting  movement
                   for  cursor  in  relative mode.  Default for Intuos series is
                   10, for Graphire  series  (including  Volitos)  is  42.  Only
                   available for the cursor/puck device.

               Option &quot;RawSample&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   Set   the   sample   window  size (a sliding average sampling
                   window) for incoming input tool raw  data  points.   Default:
                   4, range of 1 to 20.

               Option &quot;Serial&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets  the  serial number associated with the physical device.
                   This allows to have multiple devices of the same  type  (i.e.
                   multiple  pens).  This  option  is  only available on wacom V
                   devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U).  To see which  serial
                   number  belongs to a device, you need to run the utility pro&#8208;
                   gram, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.

               Option &quot;ToolSerials&quot; &quot;number[,type[,label]][;...]&quot;
                   sets the list of serial numbered devices that need to be hot&#8208;
                   plugged  for  a physical device. The &apos;type&apos; option may be any
                   of &quot;pen&quot;, &quot;airbrush&quot;, &quot;artpen&quot;, or &quot;cursor&quot;.  This option  is
                   only  available  on wacom V devices (Intuos series and Cintiq
                   21U).  To see which serial number belongs to  a  device,  you
                   need  to  run the utility program, xsetwacom, that comes with
                   this driver.

               Option &quot;Threshold&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   sets the pressure threshold  used  to  generate  a  button  1
                   events  of  stylus.   The threshold applies to the normalised
                   pressure range of [0..2048].  The default is 27.

               Option &quot;Gesture&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
                   Enable or disable gesture support on the device. Default: off
                   unless the tablet supports multi-touch.

               Option &quot;ZoomDistance&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   If  Option  &quot;Gesture&quot;  is  enabled, this option specifies the
                   minimum movement distance before a  zoom  gesture  is  recog&#8208;
                   nized.

               Option &quot;ScrollDistance&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   If  Option  &quot;Gesture&quot;  is  enabled, this option specifies the
                   minimum movement distance before a scroll gesture  is  recog&#8208;
                   nized.

               Option &quot;TapTime&quot; &quot;number&quot;
                   If  Option  &quot;Gesture&quot;  is enabled, this option determines the
                   maximum time of a touch event to  be  recognized  as  tap.  A
                   press and release event shorter than TapTime generates button
                   press and release events. Presses longer than TapTime do  not
                   generate button events, only motion events.

TOUCH GESTURES
   Single finger (1FG)
       Left click: tap, actual click happens after TapTime period elapses.

       Left  click  drag:  tap  to select, quickly (within TapTime period) touch
       selection again.  Then drag.  Available on touchpads, e.g. BambooPT,  not
       touchscreens.

   Two finger (2FG)
       Right click: one finger down + tap second finger

       Vertical  scroll:  two  fingers  side by side (in any orientation) moving
       vertically with constant separation  initiates  a  vertical  scroll.   By
       driver  default a gesture up results in a scroll down event (the document
       moves up) and a gesture down results in a scroll  up  event  (moving  the
       document down).

       Horizontal  scroll:  two fingers side by side held at a constant distance
       moving horizontally initiates a horizontal scroll.  A gesture to the left
       results  in  a scroll right event (the document moves left) and a gesture
       right results in a scroll left event (moving the document right).

       Zoom in: two separated fingers side by side, bring together i.e. pinch.

       Zoom out: two fingers side by side, spread.  Not all applications support
       zoom.
