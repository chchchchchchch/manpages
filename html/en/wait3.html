WAIT4(2)                    Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                   WAIT4(2)



NAME
       wait3, wait4 - wait for process to change state, BSD style

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

       pid_t wait3(int *status, int options,
                   struct rusage *rusage);

       pid_t wait4(pid_t pid, int *status, int options,
                   struct rusage *rusage);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wait3():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
       wait4():
           _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are obsolete; use waitpid(2) or  waitid(2)  in  new  pro&#8208;
       grams.

       The wait3() and wait4() system calls are similar to waitpid(2), but addi&#8208;
       tionally return resource usage information about the child in the  struc&#8208;
       ture pointed to by rusage.

       Other than the use of the rusage argument, the following wait3() call:

           wait3(status, options, rusage);

       is equivalent to:

           waitpid(-1, status, options);

       Similarly, the following wait4() call:

           wait4(pid, status, options, rusage);

       is equivalent to:

           waitpid(pid, status, options);

       In  other words, wait3() waits of any child, while wait4() can be used to
       select a specific child, or children, on which to wait.  See wait(2)  for
       further details.

       If  rusage  is  not  NULL,  the  struct rusage to which it points will be
       filled with accounting information about the child.  See getrusage(2) for
       details.

RETURN VALUE
       As for waitpid(2).

ERRORS
       As for waitpid(2).

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD.
&#12;       SUSv1  included  a  specification of wait3(); SUSv2 included wait3(), but
       marked it LEGACY; SUSv3 removed it.

NOTES
       Including &lt;sys/time.h&gt; is not required these days, but  increases  porta&#8208;
       bility.   (Indeed,  &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;  defines  the  rusage structure with
       fields of type struct timeval defined in &lt;sys/time.h&gt;.)

       On Linux, wait3() is a library function implemented on top of the wait4()
       system call.
