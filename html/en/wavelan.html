WAVELAN(4)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WAVELAN(4)



NAME
       wavelan - AT&amp;T GIS WaveLAN ISA device driver

SYNOPSIS
       insmod wavelan_cs.o [io=B,B..] [ irq=I,I..] [name=N,N..]

DESCRIPTION
       wavelan  is the low-level device driver for the NCR / AT&amp;T / Lucent Wave&#8208;
       LAN ISA and Digital (DEC) RoamAbout DS wireless ethernet  adapter.   This
       driver is available as a module or might be compiled in the kernel.  This
       driver supports multiple cards in both forms (up to 4) and allocates  the
       next available ethernet device (eth0..eth#) for each card found, unless a
       device name is explicitly specified (see below).  This device  name  will
       be  reported  in  the kernel log file with the MAC address, NWID and fre&#8208;
       quency used by the card.

   Parameters
       This section apply to the module form (parameters passed on the insmod(8)
       command  line).   If  the  driver  is  included  in  the  kernel, use the
       ether=IRQ,IO,NAME syntax on the kernel command line.

       io     Specify the list of base address where to search for wavelan cards
              (setting  by dip switch on the card).  If you don&apos;t specify any io
              address, the driver will scan 0x390  and  0x3E0  addresses,  which
              might conflict with other hardware...

       irq    Set  the  list of irq that each wavelan card should use (the value
              is saved in permanent storage for future use).

       name   Set the list of name to be used  for  each  wavelan  cards  device
              (name used by ifconfig(8)).

   Wireless Extensions
       Use iwconfig(8) to manipulate wireless extensions.

   NWID (or domain)
       Set  the  network  ID  [0  to  FFFF] or disable it [off].  As the NWID is
       stored in the card Permanent Storage Area, it will be reuse at  any  fur&#8208;
       ther invocation of the driver.

   Frequency &amp; channels
       For the 2.4GHz 2.00 Hardware, you are able to set the frequency by speci&#8208;
       fying one of the 10 defined channels (2.412, 2.422, 2.425, 2.4305, 2.432,
       2.442,  2.452, 2.460, 2.462 or 2.484) or directly by its value.  The fre&#8208;
       quency is changed immediately and  permanently.   Frequency  availability
       depends on the regulations...

   Statistics spy
       Set  a  list  of  MAC  addresses in the driver (up to 8) and get the last
       quality of link for each of those (see iwspy(8)).

   /proc/net/wireless
       status is the status reported by the modem.   Link  quality  reports  the
       quality  of  the  modulation on the air (direct sequence spread spectrum)
       [max = 16].  Level and Noise refer to the signal level  and  noise  level
       [max  =  64].  The crypt discarded packet and misc discarded packet coun&#8208;
       ters are not implemented.

   Private Ioctl
       You may use iwpriv(8) to manipulate private ioctls.

   Quality and Level threshold
       Enable you the define the quality and level threshold used by  the  modem
       (packet below that level are discarded).

   Histogram
       This  functionality  makes  it  possible  to set a number of signal level
       intervals and to count the number of packets received in  each  of  those
       defined intervals.  This distribution might be used to calculate the mean
       value and standard deviation of the signal level.

   Specific Notes
       This driver will fail to detect some non-NCR/ATT&amp;T/Lucent Wavelan  cards.
       If  this  happens for you, you must look in the source code on how to add
       your card to the detection routine.

       Some of the mentioned features are optional.  You may enable  to  disable
       them by changing flags in the driver header and recompile.
