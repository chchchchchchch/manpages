NAME
       wavemon - a wireless network monitor

SYNOPSIS
       wavemon [-h] [-i ifname ] [-l] [-r] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       wavemon  is  a  ncurses-based monitoring application for wireless network
       devices. It plots levels in real-time as well  as  showing  wireless  and
       network  related device information. Currently, wavemon is still based on
       the wireless extensions by Jean Tourrilhes &lt;jt@hpl.hp.com&gt;.

       The wavemon interface  splits  into  different  &quot;screens&quot;.   Each  screen
       presents information in a specific manner. For example, the &quot;info&quot; screen
       shows current levels as bargraphs, whereas the &quot;level&quot; screen  represents
       the same levels as a moving histogram.

       On  startup, you&apos;ll see (depending on configuration) one of the different
       monitor screens. At the  bottom,  you&apos;ll  find  a  menu-bar  listing  the
       screens and their activating keys. Each screen is activated by either the
       corresponding function key or the key corresponding to the first  charac&#8208;
       ter of the screen name. The following screens can be selected:

       Info (F1 or &apos;i&apos;)
              This  is  the  most  comprehensive screen. It displays a condensed
              overview of wireless-specific parameters and  network  statistics,
              as  well  as bar graphs.  The layout is arranged into several sub-
              sections.

              The Interface section at the top shows information about the moni&#8208;
              toring  interface,  including  interface  name,  type,  ESSID, and
              available encryption formats.

              Below, in the Levels section, you can see  up  to  four  bargraphs
              showing  (1)  relative signal quality and (2) signal level in dBm.
              If the wireless driver  also  supports  noise  level  information,
              additionally  (3)  noise  level  in dBm and (4) Signal-Noise-Ratio
              (SNR) in dB are shown.  The colour of the  signal  level  bargraph
              changes  from  red to yellow and green at fixed levels. If thresh&#8208;
              olds have been set, two arrows on the signal level graph will show
              the positions of the current thresholds.

              The Statistics section displays packet and byte counters and a few
              other packet-related statistics.

              The subsequent Info subsection lists the current operational  mode
              and  configuration  of the wireless interface. What parameters are
              actually shown depends on the capabilities and  selected  mode  of
              your network device.

              Lastly,  the  Network  section shows network-level parameters. The
              MAC-address is resolved from ethers(5). The IPv4 address is  shown
              in CIDR notation (RFC 4632 address/prefix_len format). Since often
              those two values also determine the broadcast address (last  32  -
              prefix_len  bits  set to 1), that address is shown only if it does
              not derive from the interface address and prefix length. Likewise,
              the  interface  MTU  is  shown only if it differs from the default
              Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes.

       Level histogram (F2 or &apos;l&apos;)
              This is a full-screen histogram plot showing the evolution of lev&#8208;
              els  with  time.   The screen is partitioned into a grid, with dBm
              levels shown in green at the right hand side (depending on config&#8208;
              uration).   At the very minimum, the evolution of the signal-level
              is shown. If the wireless driver also supports noise-level  infor&#8208;
              mation,  additionally  a  noise  graph  and  associated  SNR graph
              appear.

       Scan window (F3 or &apos;s&apos;)
              A periodically updated network scan,  showing  access  points  and
              other  wireless  clients, ordered by frequency and then descending
              order of signal quality. Each entry starts with  the  ESSID,  fol&#8208;
              lowed  by  the  colour-coded  MAC  address  and the signal/channel
              information. A green/red MAC address indicates  an  (un-)encrypted
              access  point,  the colour changes to yellow for non-access points
              (in this case the mode is shown at  the  end  of  the  line).  The
              uncoloured  information  following  the MAC address lists relative
              and absolute signal strengths, channel, frequency, and the mode if
              the  node  is  not  an  access point.  A status line at the bottom
              informs about the most (least) crowded channels, depending on  how
              sort_order is set (reverse channel or other); see wavemonrc(5).

              Please  note  that gathering meaningful scan data can take several
              seconds. Partly for this reason,  the  Scan  window  is  the  only
              screen that can not be suspended (CTRL-Z).

       Preferences (F7 or &apos;p&apos;)
              This  screen  allows  you  to  change  all program options such as
              interface and level scale parameters, and to save the new settings
              to  the  configuration  file.  Select  a  parameter  with &lt;up&gt; and
              &lt;down&gt;, then change the value  with  &lt;left&gt;  and  &lt;right&gt;.  Please
              refer  to  wavemonrc(5)  for an in-depth description of applicable
              settings.

       Help (F8 or &apos;h&apos;)
              This page might show an online-help.

       About (F9 or &apos;a&apos;)
              Release information and contact URLs.

       Quit (F10 or &apos;q&apos;)
              Exit wavemon.

       Note: some operations, such as displaying encryption information or  per&#8208;
       forming  scans,  require  CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges (see capabilities(7)).
       For non-root users, these can be enabled by  installing  wavemon  setuid-
       root.

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              override autodetection and use the specified interface.

       -d     dump interface parameters to stdout and exit.

       -g     check  screen geometry: a minimum size is required for proper dis&#8208;
              play; this flag adds a check to ensure it is  sufficiently  large.
              Enable this if window does not display properly.

       -r     generate random levels (for testing purposes).

       -h     print help and exit.

       -v     print version information and exit.
