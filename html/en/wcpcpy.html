WCPCPY(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  WCPCPY(3)



NAME
       wcpcpy - copy a wide-character string, returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcpcpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcpcpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcpcpy()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the stpcpy(3)
       function.  It copies the wide-character string pointed to by src, includ&#8208;
       ing  the terminating null wide character (L&apos;\0&apos;), to the array pointed to
       by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least  wcslen(src)+1
       wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpcpy()  returns a pointer to the end of the wide-character string dest,
       that is, a pointer to the terminating null wide character.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
