WCPNCPY(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WCPNCPY(3)



NAME
       wcpncpy  -  copy  a  fixed-size  string  of  wide characters, returning a
       pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcpncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcpncpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcpncpy() function is the wide-character equivalent of the stpncpy(3)
       function.   It  copies  at most n wide characters from the wide-character
       string pointed to by src, including the terminating null wide (L&apos;\0&apos;), to
       the  array  pointed to by dest.  Exactly n wide characters are written at
       dest.  If the length wcslen(src) is smaller than n,  the  remaining  wide
       characters  in the array pointed to by dest are filled with L&apos;\0&apos; charac&#8208;
       ters.  If the length wcslen(src) is greater or equal  to  n,  the  string
       pointed to by dest will not be L&apos;\0&apos; terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide charac&#8208;
       ters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcpncpy() returns a pointer to the last wide character written, that  is,
       dest + n - 1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.
