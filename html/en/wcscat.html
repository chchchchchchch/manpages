       wcscat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscat()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcat(3)
       function.  It copies the wide-character string pointed to by src, includ&#8208;
       ing  the terminating null wide character (L&apos;\0&apos;), to the end of the wide-
       character string pointed to by dest.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least wcslen(dest) +
       wcslen(src) + 1 wide characters at dest.
