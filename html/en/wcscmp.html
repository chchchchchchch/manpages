WCSCMP(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  WCSCMP(3)



NAME
       wcscmp - compare two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int wcscmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscmp()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcmp(3)
       function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed to by s1 and the
       wide-character string pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcscmp()  function  returns zero if the wide-character strings at s1
       and s2 are equal.  It returns an integer greater  than  zero  if  at  the
       first  differing  position  i,  the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is
       greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than zero if at the first
       differing position i, the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is less than
       s2[i].

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
