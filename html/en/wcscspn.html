NAME
       wcscspn - search a wide-character string for any of a set of wide charac&#8208;
       ters

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t wcscspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscspn() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strcspn(3)
       function.  It determines the length of the longest initial segment of wcs
       which consists entirely of wide-characters  not  listed  in  reject.   In
       other  words,  it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character
       string wcs of any of the characters in the wide-character string reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscspn() function returns the number of wide characters in the long&#8208;
       est initial segment of wcs which consists entirely of wide-characters not
       listed in reject.  In other words, it returns the position of  the  first
       occurrence  in  the wide-character string wcs of any of the characters in
       the wide-character string reject, or wcslen(wcs) if there is none.

CONFORMING TO
