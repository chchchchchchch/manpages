WCSNCASECMP(3)              Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual             WCSNCASECMP(3)



NAME
       wcsncasecmp  -  compare  two  fixed-size wide-character strings, ignoring
       case

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int wcsncasecmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2, size_t n);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcsncasecmp():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncasecmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the  strn&#8208;
       casecmp(3) function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed to by
       s1 and the wide-character string pointed to by s2, but  at  most  n  wide
       characters  from  each  string,  ignoring  case differences (towupper(3),
       towlower(3)).

RETURN VALUE
       The wcsncasecmp() function returns zero if the wide-character strings  at
       s1  and s2, truncated to at most length n, are equal except for case dis&#8208;
       tinctions.  It returns a positive integer if truncated s1 is greater than
       truncated  s2, ignoring case.  It returns a negative integer if truncated
       s1 is smaller than truncated s2, ignoring case.

VERSIONS
       The wcsncasecmp() function is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.  This function is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, and is not
       widely available on other systems.

NOTES
       The  behavior  of  wcsncasecmp()  depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
       current locale.
