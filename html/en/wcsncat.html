WCSNCAT(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WCSNCAT(3)



NAME
       wcsncat - concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcsncat(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncat() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strncat(3)
       function.  It copies at most n wide characters  from  the  wide-character
       string  pointed to by src to the end of the wide-character string pointed
       to by dest, and adds a terminating null wide character (L&apos;\0&apos;).

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least wcslen(dest) +
       n + 1 wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncat() returns dest.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
