WCSNCMP(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WCSNCMP(3)



NAME
       wcsncmp - compare two fixed-size wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strncmp(3)
       function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed to by s1 and the
       wide-character  string  pointed  to  by s2, but at most n wide characters
       from each string.  In each string, the comparison extends only up to  the
       first occurrence of a null wide character (L&apos;\0&apos;), if any.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsncmp()  function returns zero if the wide-character strings at s1
       and s2, truncated to at most length n, are equal.  It returns an  integer
       greater  than zero if at the first differing position i (i &lt; n), the cor&#8208;
       responding wide-character s1[i] is greater than  s2[i].   It  returns  an
       integer  less than zero if at the first differing position i (i &lt; n), the
       corresponding wide-character s1[i] is less than s2[i].

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
