WCSNCPY(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WCSNCPY(3)



NAME
       wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsncpy() function is the wide-character equivalent of the strncpy(3)
       function.  It copies at most n wide characters  from  the  wide-character
       string  pointed  to by src, including the terminating null wide character
       (L&apos;\0&apos;), to the array pointed to by dest.  Exactly n wide characters  are
       written  at  dest.   If  the  length  wcslen(src)  is smaller than n, the
       remaining wide characters in the array pointed to by dest are filled with
       null  wide  characters.  If the length wcslen(src) is greater or equal to
       n, the string pointed to by dest will not be terminated by  a  null  wide
       character.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide charac&#8208;
       ters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       wcsncpy() returns dest.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
