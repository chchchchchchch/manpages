WCSNRTOMBS(3)               Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual              WCSNRTOMBS(3)



NAME
       wcsnrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t wcsnrtombs(char *dest, const wchar_t **src, size_t nwc,
                         size_t len, mbstate_t *ps);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcsnrtombs():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcsnrtombs() function is like the wcsrtombs(3) function, except that
       the number of wide characters to be converted, starting at *src, is  lim&#8208;
       ited to nwc.

       If dest is not a NULL pointer, the wcsnrtombs() function converts at most
       nwc wide characters from the wide-character string *src  to  a  multibyte
       string  starting  at  dest.   At most len bytes are written to dest.  The
       shift state *ps is updated.  The conversion is effectively  performed  by
       repeatedly  calling  wcrtomb(dest,  *src,  ps), as long as this call suc&#8208;
       ceeds, and then incrementing dest by the number of bytes written and *src
       by one.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be represented as a
       multibyte sequence (according to the current locale).  In this case  *src
       is  left pointing to the invalid wide character, (size_t) -1 is returned,
       and errno is set to EILSEQ.

       2. nwc wide characters have been converted without  encountering  a  null
       wide  character (L&apos;\0&apos;), or the length limit forces a stop.  In this case
       *src is left pointing to the next wide character to be converted, and the
       number of bytes written to dest is returned.

       3. The wide-character string has been completely converted, including the
       terminating null wide character (which has the side  effect  of  bringing
       back  *ps  to  the initial state).  In this case *src is set to NULL, and
       the number of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating null  byte
       (&apos;\0&apos;), is returned.

       If  dest  is  NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above,
       except that the converted bytes are not written out to memory,  and  that
       no destination length limit exists.

       In  both  of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a static anonymous
       state only known to the wcsnrtombs function is used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least len  bytes  at
       dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsnrtombs()  function  returns the number of bytes that make up the
       converted part of multibyte sequence, not including the terminating  null
       byte.   If a wide character was encountered which could not be converted,
       (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.
&#12;CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcsnrtombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur&#8208;
       rent locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
