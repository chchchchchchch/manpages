WCSSPN(3)                   Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                  WCSSPN(3)



NAME
       wcsspn  -  advance  in  a wide-character string, skipping any of a set of
       wide characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t wcsspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *accept);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsspn() function is the wide-character equivalent of  the  strspn(3)
       function.  It determines the length of the longest initial segment of wcs
       which consists entirely of wide-characters listed in  accept.   In  other
       words,  it searches for the first occurrence in the wide-character string
       wcs of a  wide-character  not  contained  in  the  wide-character  string
       accept.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsspn() function returns the number of wide characters in the long&#8208;
       est initial segment of wcs which  consists  entirely  of  wide-characters
       listed  in  accept.  In other words, it returns the position of the first
       occurrence in the wide-character string wcs of a wide-character not  con&#8208;
       tained  in  the  wide-character string accept, or wcslen(wcs) if there is
       none.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
