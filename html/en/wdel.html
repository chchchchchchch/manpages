NAME
       wdel - A wget-like program for deleting files on ftp servers

SYNOPSIS
       wdel [option]... [URL [file]...]...

DESCRIPTION
       Wdel is a free utility that is able to delete files on an ftp server.

       Wdel  is  non-interactive  and background-capable. It can delete files or
       whole directories and is meant to be a robust client  even  for  unstable
       connections  and will therefore retry to delete a file, if the connection
       broke.

       Wdel supports connections through proxies, allowing you to use it  in  an
       environment  that  can access the internet only via a proxy or to provide
       anonymity by hiding your ip-address to the server.   For  SOCKSv5-proxies
       Wdel  supports  also  listening  mode,  allowing you to use port-mode ftp
       through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is behind a firewall or a gate&#8208;
       way).

URL-Input-Handling
       URLs are recognized by the ftp://-prefix.

       Wdel  first  reads  the  URLs from the command line, and associates every
       file with the last URL until a new URL is found (note that this  is  dif&#8208;
       ferent  from  wput).  Then, it reads the --input-file (if any) and parses
       the URLs in the same way.  So you can specify e.g. one URL and  read  all
       filenames from a file.

       If  there  are no explicit filenames given for a singe URL, then the last
       part of the URL is taken to be the file/directory to be deleted. If there
       are  filenames,  then  the  last  part of the URL is considered to be the
       directory where these files reside in. Slashes at the end of the  URL  or
       the filename (in case it is a directory to be deleted) are ignored.

OPTIONS
       There  are  no  special options introduced by Wdel. All of Wput&#226;s options
       may be supplied, although some will not be of any effect because they  do
       not  apply  for  the  process of deleting files. Please see wput(1) for a
       description of the options.

SEE ALSO
       Many options can be set in a wputrc file. For its  documentation  consult
       the sample file provided by Wput.

       wput(1) describes all setable options. Not all apply for wdel too though.
