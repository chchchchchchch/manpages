NAME
       weather - command-line tool to obtain weather conditions and forecasts

SYNOPSIS
       weather [ options ] [ alias1 | search1 [ alias2 | search2 [...]]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to current
       weather conditions and forecasts.  Presently, it is capable of  returning
       data for localities throughout the USA and some select locations globally
       by retrieving and formatting  decoded  METARs  (Meteorological  Aerodrome
       Reports)  from NOAA (the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra&#8208;
       tion) and forecasts/alerts from NWS (the USA National  Weather  Service).
       The  tool is written to function in the same spirit as other command-line
       informational  utilities  like  cal(1),  calendar(1)  and  dict(1).    It
       retrieves  arbitrary weather data via precompiled correlations or custom-
       tailored aliases (system-wide or on a per-user basis).

       Behavior can be determined by command-line options and  specification  of
       zero or more location aliases and search terms.

       Aliases  are  defined  in  weatherrc(5)  files,  as a convenient means of
       grouping URIs together using a short name.  Specifying  multiple  aliases
       or location search terms on the command line causes the utility to output
       data for each, as if it had been invoked multiple  times.   If  none  are
       specified,  then  an alias of default is checked for a defargs option and
       any alias names listed within it (comma-separated) are applied instead.

       Searches utilize location correlation sets in INI-style text files  named
       airports,  places, stations, zctas and zones.  A precomputed copy is dis&#8208;
       tributed with the source, but can be rebuilt from updated data sources as
       needed  by placing them in the current working directory and running with
       the --build-sets option (see the comments at the top of any location cor&#8208;
       relation  set  file  for  instructions  on  where  to  find  updated data
       sources).  Positive search results are cached and sourced as  aliases  on
       subsequent runs for as long as the correlation sets remain unchanged, and
       are cleared automatically once the correlation sets are updated.

       Retrieved data is also cached automatically for a short period  of  time,
       adjustable  with the cacheage configuration option or --cacheage command-
       line option.  This helps throttle load against NOAA/NWS servers  in  case
       the  utility  is  repeatedly  re-run requesting the same data, but can be
       overridden with the cache_data configuration  option  or  --no-cache-data
       command-line option.

INPUT FILES
       weather  may  additionally  obtain  configuration data from a system-wide
       configuration file, a per-user configuration file, and a local  directory
       configuration  file.   The  file  format  and  configuration  options are
       described in weatherrc(5).  They are aggregated in the following order:

       /etc/weatherrc
              the system-wide configuration

       ~/.weather/weatherrc or ~/.weatherrc
              the per-user configuration

       ./weatherrc
              the local directory configuration
