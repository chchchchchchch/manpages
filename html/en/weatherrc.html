NAME
       weatherrc - configuration file format for the weather(1) utility

DESCRIPTION
       The  weatherrc  file  format  is  intended to specify a set of aliases by
       which to group URIs  for  METAR  station  conditions  and  alert/forecast
       zones,  but  other command-line options and flags for the weather utility
       can be specified as well.  The file is organized as an INI-format config,
       with  the  alias  name  in [] brackets and the associated parameter/value
       pairs on following lines.  Parameters and their values are separated by =
       or  :  characters.  Multi-word values do not need quoting.  These parame&#8208;
       ters are supported...

       alert  include local alert notices (possible values are False and True or
              0 and 1)

       atypes list  of  alert  notification  types to display (ex: tornado_warn&#8208;
              ing,urgent_weather_message)

       cache  control all caching (possible values are False and True or  0  and
              1)

       cache_data
              control retrieved data caching (possible values are False and True
              or 0 and 1)

       cache_search
              control search result caching (possible values are False and  True
              or 0 and 1)

       cacheage
              duration in seconds to refresh cached data (ex: 900)

       cachedir
              directory for storing cached searches and data (ex: ~/.weather)

       conditions
              output current conditions (possible values are False and True or 0
              and 1)

       defargs
              list of default command-line arguments (ex: avl,rdu)

       forecast
              include a local forecast (possible values are False and True or  0
              and 1)

       headers
              list of conditions headers to display (ex: temperature,wind)

       imperial
              filter/convert  conditions  for  US/UK  units (possible values are
              False and True or 0 and 1)

       metric filter/convert conditions for metric units  (possible  values  are
              False and True or 0 and 1)

       quiet  skip  preambles  and  don&apos;t  indent (possible values are False and
              True or 0 and 1)

       setpath
              directory search path for correlation sets (ex: .:~/.weather)
&#12;       verbose
              show full decoded feeds (possible values are False and True  or  0
              and 1)

EXAMPLES
       The  following  is  an  example  ~/.weather/weatherrc  defining  a couple
       aliases named home and work to be displayed when running the utility with
       no aliases specified...

[default]
defargs = home,work

[home]
description = Conditions and Forecast at Home
forecast = True
metar = http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/decoded/KRDU.TXT
zone_forecast = http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/forecasts/zone/nc/ncz041.txt

[work]
description = Conditions at Work
metar = http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/decoded/KGSO.TXT

       Now  if  weather is invoked by itself on the command line, it will output
       conditions for home and work, and also a forecast for home only.
