NAME
       weave - translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS
       weave [-x] webfile[.web] [changefile[.ch]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documenta&#8208;
       tion for this version of TeX can be found in  the  info  file  or  manual
       Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The weave program is used to create a TeX file for viewing a Web program.
       It takes appropriate care of typographic details like page layout and the
       use  of  indentation,  italics, boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive
       cross-index information that it gathers automatically.  The command  line
       arguments  are  the  same as for tangle except for the option: -x says to
       omit the index, module name list, and table of contents pages.   (A  CON&#8208;
       TENTS.tex file will still be written when the TeX file is processed, how&#8208;
       ever, unless some macros in webmac.tex are redefined.)

       The output TeX file name is formed by adding .tex to the root of the  Web
       file name.

       There  are  several  macros that probably should be redefined by the pro&#8208;
       grammer at the beginning of the Web file.  It  is  a  good  idea  to  set
       \title  to the name of the program.  And, to cause output of only changed
       modules, one can say \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first change  in
       the change file).

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable WEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files,
       or the system default if WEBINPUTS  is  not  set.   See  tex(1)  for  the
       details of the searching.

FILES
       $TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/webmac.tex
           TeX macros used by weave output.
