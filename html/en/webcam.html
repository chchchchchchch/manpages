NAME
       webcam - capture images and upload them to a webserver using ftp

SYNOPSIS
       webcam [ config file ]

DESCRIPTION
       webcam  captures  images  from  a video4linux device like bttv, annotates
       them and and uploads them to a webserver using ftp in a endless loop.

CONFIGURATION
       At startup webcam reads the configuration from the given config  file  or
       ~/.webcamrc if none is specified in the command line.

       The  config file has at least two sections.  The &quot;grab&quot; section holds the
       capture parameters.  Any other section describes where the  image  should
       be  uploaded.   Older  versions  used  &quot;ftp&quot;  as  name  for that section.
       Recently the webcam utility got support for  multiple  connections,  thus
       any  section  name is accepted and you can have more than one ftp section
       (you have to use another name for each section  througth,  name  them  by
       upload servers for example).

       Here is an sample config file (the given values are the defaults):

       [grab]
       device = /dev/video0
       driver = libv4l
       text = &quot;webcam %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;
       infofile = filename
       fg_red = 255
       fg_green = 255
       fg_blue = 255
       width = 320
       height = 240
       delay = 3
       wait = 0
       input = composite1
       norm = pal
       rotate = 0
       top = 0
       left = 0
       bottom = -1
       right = -1
       quality = 75
       trigger = 0
       once = 0

       [ftp]
       host = www
       user = webcam
       pass = xxxxxx
       dir  = public_html/images
       file = webcam.jpeg
       tmp  = uploading.jpeg
       passive = 1
       debug = 0
       auto = 0
       local = 0
       ssh = 0

       The annotation text is processed with strftime.  Check the strftime(3) or
       date(1) manpage to see how you can format the timestamps.  The  text  can
       also  be  read  from  a extern file (use infofile for that).  The default
       color for the text overlay is white  (RGB=255,255,255).  Entries  in  the
       range  of  0 through 255 for fg_red, fg_green, and fg_blue can be used to
       define a different color.  Likewise bg_red, bg_green, and bg_blue can  be
       used to set the background color (which defaults to transparent).

       input  is  the  video  source  (TV/composite/whatever), norm the TV norm.
       delay is the delay between two images in seconds.  wait  is  the  initial
       delay  before the first image is grabbed (some cameras need some time for
       adapting to lightning, thus don&apos;t return images with  reasonable  quality
       within  the  first few seconds ...).  quality is the JPEG quality for the
       stored images.

       top, bottom, left, and right in the grab section allow cropping the image
       after  it  is  grabbed.   They  should  satisfy 0&lt;=top&lt;bottom&lt;=height and
       0&lt;=left&lt;right&lt;=width.  (0,0 is the top, left corner.)  If rotate is posi&#8208;
       tive,  the output image will be rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees that
       number of times (1, 2, or 3).

       With trigger set to a non-zero value webcam will upload the image only if
       the content of the image has changed.  It just looks for the maximum dif&#8208;
       ference between the last uploaded and current image and if it is  greater
       than the specified value the image will be uploaded.  If once is set to 1
       webcam will upload a single frame and quit.

       archive can be used to create a (local) archive  of  the  webcam  images.
       Just  specify  the filename for the files as argument.  The filename will
       be processed with strftime(3), so you can use the place  the  usual  time
       format  controls  into  the string to get unique filenames.  Non-existing
       directories are created if needed.

       If debug in the ftp section  is  set  to  1  the  complete  communication
       between  webcam  and  the ftp utility is printed to stderr.  auto enables
       autologin via ~/.netrc (starts the ftp utility without the  &apos;-n&apos;  switch,
       check  the  ftp(1)  man  page for more info about the ~/.netrc file).  If
       local in the ftp section is non-zero, files will be stored locally (using
       the  dir,  tmp,  and file parameters) rather than ftped.  ssh set to non-
       zero makes webcam use ssh instead of ftp.

CORRECTION OF DISTORTION
       contributed by Frederic Helin, the parameters belong into the [grab] sec&#8208;
       tion of the config file too.

       distor = 1
              If distor param is set to 1, the correction of distortion works.

       distor_k = 700
              This  is the coefficient of distortion. This algorithm is based on
              the paper &quot;Correcting Distortion of Image by  Image  Registration&quot;
              of  Toru  Tamaki,  Tsuyoshi Yamamura and Noboru Ahnishi. More your
              lens has an important distortion, more &apos;distor_k&apos; must  be  neared
              of  0.  700 is the default value. Coefficient k of program is x100
              than article.

       distor_cx = 192

       distor_cy = 144
              Coordinates of the lens optical axis: width/2 and height/2 are the
              default  values. The axis doesn&apos;t go through the image center. So,
              you can change its coordinates  around  the  center  of  image  to
              affine correction.

       distor_zoom = 30
              Zoom parameter is used to cache the distorted borders of image, if
              you don&apos;t like this. Default value is 100.
&#12;       distor_sensorw = 320

       distor_sensorh = 240
              Dimensions of camera sensor. Default values are for  1/4p  sensor.
              This parameters used to have the same k coefficient than article.
