WHOIS.CONF(5)                   Debian GNU/Linux                   WHOIS.CONF(5)



NAME
       whois.conf - alternative WHOIS servers list for whois client


SYNOPSIS
       /etc/whois.conf


DESCRIPTION
       This  file contains a list of WHOIS servers which can augment or override
       the built-in list of the client.

       It&apos;s a plain text file in ASCII  encoding.  Each  line  consists  of  two
       fields:  a  pattern  to match WHOIS object identifier and a corresponding
       WHOIS server domain name.

       Fields are separated by non-empty sequence of space or a tabular  charac&#8208;
       ters.   A  line starting with a hash character is a free comment and it&apos;s
       not considered.

       The pattern is case-insensitive  extended  regular  expression  if  whois
       client  has  been compiled with POSIX regular expressions support. Other&#8208;
       wise, simple case-insensitive  suffix  comparison  against  WHOIS  object
       identifier is used.

       Internationalized  domain names (IDN) must be specified in ascii-compati&#8208;
       ble encoding (ACE) format.
