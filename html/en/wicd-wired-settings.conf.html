NAME
       wicd-wired-settings.conf - controls Wicd&apos;s wireless network settings


DESCRIPTION
       This  file  contains configuration information for wireless interfaces in
       Wicd.
       This file is located at /etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf



SETTINGS
       bssid = &lt;BSSID_of_network&gt;
              This value can be found using iwconfig(8).

       essid = &lt;ESSID_of_network&gt;
              This value can be found using iwconfig(8).

       hidden = &lt;True|False&gt;
              This option notes whether the network&apos;s ESSID is broadcast or not.

       channel = &lt;integer_value&gt;
              Valid channels are dependent upon country.
              This value can be found using iwconfig(8).

       mode = &lt;Master|Ad-hoc&gt;
              This value can be found using iwconfig(8).

       enctype = &lt;encryption_template&gt;
              This can take the  value  of  any  encryption  template  shown  in
              /etc/wicd/encryption/templates/.

       encryption_method = WEP|WPA|WPA2&gt;
              This value can be found using iwconfig(8).

       key = &lt;plain_text_key&gt;
              Be sure this file is readable only by root.

       automatic = &lt;True|False&gt;
              This  option  determines whether Wicd should automatically connect
              to this network.

       ip = &lt;None|ip_address&gt;
              Use this option if you have a static ip address for your system.

       netmask = &lt;None|networkmask&gt;
              This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is config&#8208;
              ured above.

       broadcast = &lt;None|broadcast_address&gt;
              This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is config&#8208;
              ured above.

       gateway = &lt;None|gateway_address&gt;
              This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is config&#8208;
              ured above.

       use_static_dns = &lt;True|False&gt;
              True  =  use static DNS servers instead of accepting what the dhcp
              server supplies.

       use_global_dns = &lt;True|False&gt;
              True = use the global DNS servers  provided  in  wicd-manager-set&#8208;
              tings.conf(5).
              This option is only appropriate if &quot;use_static_dns = True&quot;

       dns1 = &lt;None|ip_address&gt;
              Static  DNS address if &quot;use_static_dns = True&quot; and &quot;use_global_dns
              = False&quot;

       dns2 = &lt;None|ip_address&gt;
              Static DNS address if &quot;use_static_dns = True&quot; and  &quot;use_global_dns
              = False&quot;

       dns3 = &lt;None|ip_address&gt;
              Static  DNS address if &quot;use_static_dns = True&quot; and &quot;use_global_dns
              = False&quot;

       use_settings_globally = &lt;0|1&gt;
              Wicd keeps track of whether to autoconnect to  networks  based  on
              bssid.   This  ensures  that  you  don&apos;t  accidentally  connect to
              another network that is not yours but happens  to  have  the  same
              essid  - for example, there are a lot of commercial routers in use
              with &quot;linksys&quot; as the essid.
              0 = Do not use settings globally
              1 = Use settings globally

       beforescript = &lt;None|arbitrary_script&gt;
              This defines a script to run before Wicd brings up the connection.
              IMPORTANT - scripts should ONLY be writable by root and should  be
              located in a directory that is writable by only root.

       afterscript = &lt;None|arbitrary_script&gt;
              This defines a script to run after Wicd brings up the connection.
              IMPORTANT - scripts should ONLY be writable by root and located in
              a directory that is writable by only root.

       predisconnectscript = &lt;None|arbitrary_script&gt;
              This defines a script to run before Wicd  disconnects  the  inter&#8208;
              face.

       postdisconnectscript = &lt;None|arbitrary_script&gt;
              This defines a script to run after Wicd disconnects the interface.
              IMPORTANT - scripts should ONLY be writable by root and located in
              a directory that is writable by only root.




OTHER
       The &quot;use_settings_globally&quot; option determines how an individual network&apos;s
       configuration  stanza  starts.  If the option is &quot;0&quot; (do not use settings
       globally), then the stanza&apos;s top line will be the  bssid  of  the  access
       point (in this format):
       [00:15:3E:87:D3:68]
       If the &quot;option is set to &quot;1&quot; (use settings globally), then the first line
       of the stanza will be in this format:
       [essid:UA Public Wireless Network]
