       Ultrasound compatible patch files.

SYNTAX
       guspat_editor_author_cant_read_so_fix_release_time_for_me
              Some patch file editors switch the 4th and  5th  envelopes  around
              making  the  sould  play much longer than intended in players that
              stuck to the Gravis  Ultrasound  patch  standard.  Including  this
              option  in  the  config enables a fix that detects this oversight,
              playing the sound samples as if they were correct.

              NOTE: This is a global setting. If it  is  found  to  affect  good
              patch  samples it will be moved to a per patch setting in a future
              version.

       auto_amp
              Forces WildMIDI to amplify samples to their maximum level ignoring
              the amp=% in the patch lines of the config.

       auto_amp_with_amp
              Forces  WildMIDI  to  amplify  samples to their maximum level then
              apply the amp=% in the patch lines of the config.

       dir dir-name
              Change the search path for config and  patch  files  to  dir-name.
              This  is  specific  to  the current config file and carried to any
              included config file unless they have their own dir  setting.  Any
              included file that has its own dir setting does not effect the dir
              setting of the current config file.

       source include-confg
              Include the settings from include-config. Any  patch  already  set
              will be over-ridden by the included config file.

       bank N The  patches following this setting belong to MIDI instrument bank
              N.

       drumset N
              The patches following this setting belong to MIDI drum bank N.

       patchno patchfile  [amp=volume]  [note=miodinte]  [keep=loop]  [keep=env]
       [remove=sustain]          [remove=clamped]         [env_level[0-5]=level]
       [env_time[0-5]=time]

       Example: 0 acpiano.pat amp=110

              patchno
                     This is the MIDI patch number the instrument belongs to.

              patchfile
                     The filename of the  Gravis  Ulstrasound  compatible  patch
                     file.  If  the filename is missing the .pat extension, lib&#8208;
                     WildMidi will add .pat when attempting to load the file.

              amp=volume
                     Force the volume of the samples in  this  patch  to  volume
                     prior to using it.

              note=midinote
                     Use  note  midinote when playing the samples in this patch.
                     NOTE: this is for instruments listed under drumset.

              keep=loop
                     Play the samples in this patch with the loop, when normally
                     we would not for this instrument.

              keep=env
                     Use  the  envelope  data  in  this  patch, when normally we
                     wouldn&apos;t for this instrument.

              remove=sustain
                     Do note hold the note after the  3rd  envelope  until  note
                     off, which is what happens if the sustain bit is set in the
                     patch file.

              remove=clamped
                     Do not jump to 6th envelope on note off, which is what hap&#8208;
                     pens if the clamped bit is set in the patch file.

              env_level[0-5]=level
                     Set the envelope level to level with 1.0 being maximum, and
                     0.0 being minimum.

                     Example: set 5th envelope level to 10% - env_level[0-5]=0.1

              env_time[0-5]=time
                     Set the envelope time to time with a resolution of 1/1000th
                     of  a  second.  This setting is the time it should take for
                     the envelope to reach maximum level.

                     Example: set 1st enevelope time to 1sec - env_time0=1000

                     Example: set 3rd enevelope time to 0.5secs- env_time2=500

       reverb_room_width fval
              Set the room width for the reverb engine  in  meters.  fval  is  a
              float value in meters. Minimum setting is 1.0 meters, maximum set&#8208;
              ting is 100.0 meters, and default is 15.0 meters.

              Example: set room width to 30 meters - reverb_room_width 30

       reverb_room_length fval
              Set the room length for the reverb engine in  meters.  fval  is  a
              float  value  in  meters. . Minimum setting is 1.0 meters, maximum
              setting is 100.0 meters, and default is 20.0 meters.

              Example: set room length to 40 meters - reverb_room_length 40
