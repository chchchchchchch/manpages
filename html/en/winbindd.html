NAME
       winbindd - Name Service Switch daemon for resolving names from NT servers

SYNOPSIS
       winbindd [-D] [-F] [-S] [-i] [-Y] [-d &lt;debug level&gt;]
        [-s &lt;smb config file&gt;] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of the samba(7) suite.

       winbindd is a daemon that provides a number of services to the Name
       Service Switch capability found in most modern C libraries, to arbitrary
       applications via PAM and ntlm_auth and to Samba itself.

       Even if winbind is not used for nsswitch, it still provides a service to
       smbd, ntlm_auth and the pam_winbind.so PAM module, by managing
       connections to domain controllers. In this configuration the idmap config
       * : range parameter is not required. (This is known as `netlogon proxy
       only mode&#180;.)

       The Name Service Switch allows user and system information to be obtained
       from different databases services such as NIS or DNS. The exact behaviour
       can be configured through the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. Users and groups
       are allocated as they are resolved to a range of user and group ids
       specified by the administrator of the Samba system.

       The service provided by winbindd is called `winbind&#180; and can be used to
       resolve user and group information from a Windows NT server. The service
       can also provide authentication services via an associated PAM module.

       The pam_winbind module supports the auth, account and password
       module-types. It should be noted that the account module simply performs
       a getpwnam() to verify that the system can obtain a uid for the user, as
       the domain controller has already performed access control. If the
       libnss_winbind library has been correctly installed, or an alternate
       source of names configured, this should always succeed.

       The following nsswitch databases are implemented by the winbindd service:

       hosts
           This feature is only available on IRIX. User information
           traditionally stored in the hosts(5) file and used by
           gethostbyname(3) functions. Names are resolved through the WINS
           server or by broadcast.

       passwd
           User information traditionally stored in the passwd(5) file and used
           by getpwent(3) functions.

       group
           Group information traditionally stored in the group(5) file and used
           by getgrent(3) functions.

       For example, the following simple configuration in the /etc/nsswitch.conf
       file can be used to initially resolve user and group information from
       /etc/passwd and /etc/group and then from the Windows NT server.

           passwd:         files winbind
           group:          files winbind
           ## only available on IRIX: use winbind to resolve hosts:
           # hosts:        files dns winbind
           ## All other NSS enabled systems should use libnss_wins.so like this:
           hosts:          files dns wins


       The following simple configuration in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file can be
       used to initially resolve hostnames from /etc/hosts and then from the
       WINS server.

           hosts:         files wins

OPTIONS
       -D
           If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a
           daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background on the
           appropriate port. This switch is assumed if winbindd is executed on
           the command line of a shell.

       -F
           If specified, this parameter causes the main winbindd process to not
           daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the terminal. Child
           processes are still created as normal to service each connection
           request, but the main process does not exit. This operation mode is
           suitable for running winbindd under process supervisors such as
           supervise and svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&#180;s daemontools package,
           or the AIX process monitor.

       -S
           If specified, this parameter causes winbindd to log to standard
           output rather than a file.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter
           is not specified is 0.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
           files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
           errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of
           information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
           should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
           designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
           data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
           smb.conf.5.html# parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
           server. The information in this file includes server-specific
           information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
           descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
           smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot;
           will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file
           is never removed by the client.

       -h|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.
&#12;       -i
           Tells winbindd to not become a daemon and detach from the current
           terminal. This option is used by developers when interactive
           debugging of winbindd is required.  winbindd also logs to standard
           output, as if the -S parameter had been given.

       -n
           Disable caching. This means winbindd will always have to wait for a
           response from the domain controller before it can respond to a client
           and this thus makes things slower. The results will however be more
           accurate, since results from the cache might not be up-to-date. This
           might also temporarily hang winbindd if the DC doesn&#180;t respond.

       -Y
           Single daemon mode. This means winbindd will run as a single process
           (the mode of operation in Samba 2.2). Winbindd&#180;s default behavior is
           to launch a child process that is responsible for updating expired
           cache entries.

NAME AND ID RESOLUTION
       Users and groups on a Windows NT server are assigned a security id (SID)
       which is globally unique when the user or group is created. To convert
       the Windows NT user or group into a unix user or group, a mapping between
       SIDs and unix user and group ids is required. This is one of the jobs
       that winbindd performs.

       As winbindd users and groups are resolved from a server, user and group
       ids are allocated from a specified range. This is done on a first come,
       first served basis, although all existing users and groups will be mapped
       as soon as a client performs a user or group enumeration command. The
       allocated unix ids are stored in a database and will be remembered.

       WARNING: The SID to unix id database is the only location where the user
       and group mappings are stored by winbindd. If this store is deleted or
       corrupted, there is no way for winbindd to determine which user and group
       ids correspond to Windows NT user and group rids.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration of the winbindd daemon is done through configuration
       parameters in the smb.conf(5) file. All parameters should be specified in
       the [global] section of smb.conf.

       &#183;    winbind separator

       &#183;    idmap config * : range

       &#183;    idmap config * : backend

       &#183;    winbind cache time

       &#183;    winbind enum users

       &#183;    winbind enum groups

       &#183;    template homedir

       &#183;    template shell

       &#183;    winbind use default domain

       &#183;    winbind: rpc only Setting this parameter forces winbindd to use RPC
           instead of LDAP to retrieve information from Domain Controllers.

EXAMPLE SETUP
       To setup winbindd for user and group lookups plus authentication from a
       domain controller use something like the following setup. This was tested
       on an early Red Hat Linux box.

       In /etc/nsswitch.conf put the following:

           passwd: files winbind
           group:  files winbind

       In /etc/pam.d/* replace the
        auth lines with something like this:

           auth  required    /lib/security/pam_securetty.so
           auth  required   /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
           auth  sufficient  /lib/security/pam_winbind.so
           auth  required    /lib/security/pam_unix.so \
                             use_first_pass shadow nullok


           Note
           The PAM module pam_unix has recently replaced the module pam_pwdb.
           Some Linux systems use the module pam_unix2 in place of pam_unix.

       Note in particular the use of the sufficient keyword and the
       use_first_pass keyword.

       Now replace the account lines with this:

       account required /lib/security/pam_winbind.so

       The next step is to join the domain. To do that use the net program like
       this:

       net join -S PDC -U Administrator

       The username after the -U can be any Domain user that has administrator
       privileges on the machine. Substitute the name or IP of your PDC for
       &quot;PDC&quot;.

       Next copy libnss_winbind.so to /lib and pam_winbind.so to /lib/security.
       A symbolic link needs to be made from /lib/libnss_winbind.so to
       /lib/libnss_winbind.so.2. If you are using an older version of glibc then
       the target of the link should be /lib/libnss_winbind.so.1.

       Finally, setup a smb.conf(5) containing directives like the following:

           [global]
                winbind separator = +
                   winbind cache time = 10
                   template shell = /bin/bash
                   template homedir = /home/%D/%U
                   idmap config * : range = 10000-20000
                   workgroup = DOMAIN
                   security = domain
                   password server = *

       Now start winbindd and you should find that your user and group database
       is expanded to include your NT users and groups, and that you can login
       to your unix box as a domain user, using the DOMAIN+user syntax for the
       username. You may wish to use the commands getent passwd and getent group
       to confirm the correct operation of winbindd.

NOTES
       The following notes are useful when configuring and running winbindd:

       nmbd(8) must be running on the local machine for winbindd to work.

       PAM is really easy to misconfigure. Make sure you know what you are doing
       when modifying PAM configuration files. It is possible to set up PAM such
       that you can no longer log into your system.

       If more than one UNIX machine is running winbindd, then in general the
       user and groups ids allocated by winbindd will not be the same. The user
       and group ids will only be valid for the local machine, unless a shared
       idmap config * : backend is configured.

       If the the Windows NT SID to UNIX user and group id mapping file is
       damaged or destroyed then the mappings will be lost.

SIGNALS
       The following signals can be used to manipulate the winbindd daemon.

       SIGHUP
           Reload the smb.conf(5) file and apply any parameter changes to the
           running version of winbindd. This signal also clears any cached user
           and group information. The list of other domains trusted by winbindd
           is also reloaded.

       SIGUSR2
           The SIGUSR2 signal will cause winbindd to write status information to
           the winbind log file.

           Log files are stored in the filename specified by the log file
           parameter.

FILES
       /etc/nsswitch.conf(5)
           Name service switch configuration file.

       /tmp/.winbindd/pipe
           The UNIX pipe over which clients communicate with the winbindd
           program. For security reasons, the winbind client will only attempt
           to connect to the winbindd daemon if both the /tmp/.winbindd
           directory and /tmp/.winbindd/pipe file are owned by root.

       /var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged/pipe
           The UNIX pipe over which &#180;privileged&#180; clients communicate with the
           winbindd program. For security reasons, access to some winbindd
           functions - like those needed by the ntlm_auth utility - is
           restricted. By default, only users in the &#180;root&#180; group will get this
           access, however the administrator may change the group permissions on
           /var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged to allow programs like &#180;squid&#180; to
           use ntlm_auth. Note that the winbind client will only attempt to
           connect to the winbindd daemon if both the
           /var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged directory and
           /var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged/pipe file are owned by root.

       /lib/libnss_winbind.so.X
           Implementation of name service switch library.

       /var/run/samba/winbindd_idmap.tdb
           Storage for the Windows NT rid to UNIX user/group id mapping.

       /var/run/samba/winbindd_cache.tdb
           Storage for cached user and group information.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.
