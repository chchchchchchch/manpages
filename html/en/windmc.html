WINDMC(1)                     GNU Development Tools                    WINDMC(1)



NAME
       windmc - generates Windows message resources.

SYNOPSIS
       windmc [options] input-file

DESCRIPTION
       windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and translate
       them into a set of output files.  The output files may be of four kinds:

       &quot;h&quot; A C header file containing the message definitions.

       &quot;rc&quot;
           A resource file compilable by the windres tool.

       &quot;bin&quot;
           One or more binary files containing the resource data for a specific
           message language.

       &quot;dbg&quot;
           A C include file that maps message id&apos;s to their symbolic name.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.

       When windmc converts from the &quot;mc&quot; format to the &quot;bin&quot; format, &quot;rc&quot;, &quot;h&quot;,
       and optional &quot;dbg&quot; it is acting like the Windows Message Compiler.

OPTIONS
       -a
       --ascii_in
           Specifies that the input file specified is ASCII. This is the default
           behaviour.

       -A
       --ascii_out
           Specifies that messages in the output &quot;bin&quot; files should be in ASCII
           format.

       -b
       --binprefix
           Specifies that &quot;bin&quot; filenames should have to be prefixed by the
           basename of the source file.

       -c
       --customflag
           Sets the customer bit in all message id&apos;s.

       -C codepage
       --codepage_in codepage
           Sets the default codepage to be used to convert input file to UTF16.
           The default is ocdepage 1252.

       -d
       --decimal_values
           Outputs the constants in the header file in decimal. Default is using
           hexadecimal output.

       -e ext
       --extension ext
           The extension for the header file. The default is .h extension.
&#12;       -F target
       --target target
           Specify the BFD format to use for a bin file as output.  This is a
           BFD target name; you can use the --help option to see a list of
           supported targets.  Normally windmc will use the default format,
           which is the first one listed by the --help option.

       -h path
       --headerdir path
           The target directory of the generated header file. The default is the
           current directory.

       -H
       --help
           Displays a list of command line options and then exits.

       -m characters
       --maxlength characters
           Instructs windmc to generate a warning if the length of any message
           exceeds the number specified.

       -n
       --nullterminate
           Terminate message text in &quot;bin&quot; files by zero. By default they are
           terminated by CR/LF.

       -o
       --hresult_use
           Not yet implemented. Instructs &quot;windmc&quot; to generate an OLE2 header
           file, using HRESULT definitions. Status codes are used if the flag is
           not specified.

       -O codepage
       --codepage_out codepage
           Sets the default codepage to be used to output text files. The
           default is ocdepage 1252.

       -r path
       --rcdir path
           The target directory for the generated &quot;rc&quot; script and the generated
           &quot;bin&quot; files that the resource compiler script includes. The default
           is the current directory.

       -u
       --unicode_in
           Specifies that the input file is UTF16.

       -U
       --unicode_out
           Specifies that messages in the output &quot;bin&quot; file should be in UTF16
           format. This is the default behaviour.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose mode.

       -V
       --version
           Prints the version number for windmc.

       -x path
       --xdgb path
           The path of the &quot;dbg&quot; C include file that maps message id&apos;s to the
           symbolic name. No such file is generated without specifying the
           switch.
&#12;       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
