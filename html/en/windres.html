NAME
       windres - manipulate Windows resources.

SYNOPSIS
       windmc [options] input-file windres [options] [input-file] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output
       file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

       &quot;rc&quot;
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

       &quot;res&quot;
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

       &quot;coff&quot;
           A COFF object or executable.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.

       When windres converts from the &quot;rc&quot; format to the &quot;res&quot; format, it is
       acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When windres converts from
       the &quot;res&quot; format to the &quot;coff&quot; format, it is acting like the Windows
       &quot;CVTRES&quot; program.

       When windres generates an &quot;rc&quot; file, the output is similar but not
       identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input &quot;rc&quot; file
       refers to an external filename, an output &quot;rc&quot; file will instead include
       the file contents.

       If the input or output format is not specified, windres will guess based
       on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.  A file with
       an extension of .rc will be treated as an &quot;rc&quot; file, a file with an
       extension of .res will be treated as a &quot;res&quot; file, and a file with an
       extension of .o or .exe will be treated as a &quot;coff&quot; file.

       If no output file is specified, windres will print the resources in &quot;rc&quot;
       format to standard output.

       The normal use is for you to write an &quot;rc&quot; file, use windres to convert
       it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file into your
       application.  This will make the resources described in the &quot;rc&quot; file
       available to Windows.

OPTIONS
       -i filename
       --input filename
           The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then windres
           will use the first non-option argument as the input file name.  If
           there are no non-option arguments, then windres will read from
           standard input.  windres can not read a COFF file from standard
           input.

       -o filename
       --output filename
           The name of the output file.  If this option is not used, then
           windres will use the first non-option argument, after any used for
           the input file name, as the output file name.  If there is no non-
           option argument, then windres will write to standard output.  windres
           can not write a COFF file to standard output.  Note, for
           compatibility with rc the option -fo is also accepted, but its use is
           not recommended.

       -J format
       --input-format format
           The input format to read.  format may be res, rc, or coff.  If no
           input format is specified, windres will guess, as described above.

       -O format
       --output-format format
           The output format to generate.  format may be res, rc, or coff.  If
           no output format is specified, windres will guess, as described
           above.

       -F target
       --target target
           Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input or output.
           This is a BFD target name; you can use the --help option to see a
           list of supported targets.  Normally windres will use the default
           format, which is the first one listed by the --help option.

       --preprocessor program
           When windres reads an &quot;rc&quot; file, it runs it through the C
           preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the
           preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments.  The default
           preprocessor argument is &quot;gcc -E -xc-header -DRC_INVOKED&quot;.

       -I directory
       --include-dir directory
           Specify an include directory to use when reading an &quot;rc&quot; file.
           windres will pass this to the preprocessor as an -I option.  windres
           will also search this directory when looking for files named in the
           &quot;rc&quot; file.  If the argument passed to this command matches any of the
           supported formats (as described in the -J option), it will issue a
           deprecation warning, and behave just like the -J option.  New
           programs should not use this behaviour.  If a directory happens to
           match a format, simple prefix it with ./ to disable the backward
           compatibility.

       -D target
       --define sym[=val]
           Specify a -D option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an &quot;rc&quot;
           file.

       -U target
       --undefine sym
           Specify a -U option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an &quot;rc&quot;
           file.

       -r  Ignored for compatibility with rc.

       -v  Enable verbose mode.  This tells you what the preprocessor is if you
           didn&apos;t specify one.

       -c val
       --codepage val
           Specify the default codepage to use when reading an &quot;rc&quot; file.  val
           should be a hexadecimal prefixed by 0x or decimal codepage code. The
           valid range is from zero up to 0xffff, but the validity of the
           codepage is host and configuration dependent.

       -l val
       --language val
           Specify the default language to use when reading an &quot;rc&quot; file.  val
           should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low eight bits are the
           language, and the high eight bits are the sublanguage.

       --use-temp-file
           Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the output of
           the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen implementation is
           buggy on the host (eg., certain non-English language versions of
           Windows 95 and Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where the
           output will instead go the console).

       --no-use-temp-file
           Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the
           preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

       -h
       --help
           Prints a usage summary.

       -V
       --version
           Prints the version number for windres.

       --yydebug
           If windres is compiled with &quot;YYDEBUG&quot; defined as 1, this will turn on
           parser debugging.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character
           may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in
           either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
           with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file
           options; any such options will be processed recursively.
