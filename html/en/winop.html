DESCRIPTION
       The  winop command performs various window operations on Tk windows using
       low-level Xlib function calls to work around  window  manager  peculiari&#8208;
       ties.

INTRODUCTION
       Tk  has  several commands for manipulating its windows: raise, lower, wm,
       etc.  These commands ask the window manager to perform operations  on  Tk
       windows.   In  some  cases, a particular window manager won&apos;t perform the
       operation as expected.

       For example, if you positioned a toplevel window using wm  geometry,  the
       window may not actually be at those particular coordinates.  The position
       of the window may be offset by dimensions of the title bar added  by  the
       window manager.

       In  situations  like  these,  the winop command can be used to workaround
       these difficulties.  Instead, it makes low-level Xlib (such  XRaiseWindow
       and XMapWindow) calls to perform these operations.

              toplevel .top
              wm withdraw .top

              # Set the geometry to make the window manager
              # place the window.
              wm geometry .top +100+100

              # Move the window to the desired location
              # and &quot;update&quot; to force the window manager
              # to recognize it.
              winop move .top 100 100
              update

              wm deiconify .top
              winop move .top 100 100


OPERATIONS
       The following operations are available for the winop command:

       winop lower ?window?...
              Lowers  window to the bottom of the X window stack.  Window is the
              path name of a Tk window.

       winop map ?window?...
              Maps window on the screen.  Window is the path name of a  Tk  win&#8208;
              dow. If window is already mapped, this command has no effect.

       winop move window x y
              Move window to the screen location specified by x and y. Window is
              the path name of a Tk window, while x and  y  are  screen  coordi&#8208;
              nates.  This command returns the empty string.

       winop raise ?window?...
              Raises  window  to the top of the X window stack. Window must be a
              valid path name of a Tk window.  This command  returns  the  empty
              string.

       winop snap window photoName
              Takes  a  snapshot  of  the  window and stores the contents in the
              photo image photoName. Window is the valid path name of a Tk  win&#8208;
              dow  which must be totally visible (unobscured).  PhotoName is the
              name of a Tk photo image which must already exist.   This  command
              can fail if the window is obscured in any fashion, such as covered
              by another window or partially offscreen.  In that case, an  error
              message is returned.

       winop unmap ?window?...
              Unmaps  window  from  the  screen. Window is the path name of a Tk
              window.

       winop warpto ?window?
              Warps the pointer to window. Window is the path name of a Tk  win&#8208;
              dow  which  must be mapped. If window is in the form @x,y, where x
              and y are root screen coordinates, the pointer is warped  to  that
              location on the screen.

              [I&apos;ve never heard a good case for warping the pointer in an appli&#8208;
              cation.  It can be useful for testing, but in  applications,  it&apos;s
              always  a bad idea.  Simply stated, the user owns the pointer, not
              the application.  If you have an application that  needs  it,  I&apos;d
              like to hear about it.]

              If  no  window  argument  is  present  the current location of the
              pointer is returned. The location is returned as  a  list  in  the
              form  &quot;x  y&quot;,  where  x  and  y are the current coordinates of the
              pointer.
