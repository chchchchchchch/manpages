NAME
       wipefs - wipe a filesystem signature from a device

SYNOPSIS
       wipefs [-ahnpV] [-o offset] device

DESCRIPTION
       wipefs  can  erase filesystem or raid signatures (magic strings) from the
       specified device to make the filesystem invisible for  libblkid.   wipefs
       does  not erase the filesystem itself nor any other data from the device.
       When used without options -a or -o, it lists all visible filesystems  and
       the offsets of their signatures.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Erase all available signatures.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -n, --no-act
              Causes everything to be done except for the write() call.

       -o, --offset offset
              Specify  the  location (in bytes) of the signature which should be
              erased from the device.  The offset number may include a &quot;0x&quot; pre&#8208;
              fix;  then  the  number will be interpreted as a hex value.  It is
              possible to specify multiple -o options.

              The offset argument may be followed by binary (2^N) suffixes  KiB,
              MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the &quot;iB&quot; is optional, e.g. &quot;K&quot; has the
              same meaning as &quot;KiB&quot;) or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB,  GB,  PB
              and EB.

       -p, --parsable
              Print  out  in  parsable  instead of printable format.  Encode all
              potentially unsafe characters of a string to the corresponding hex
              value prefixed by &apos;\x&apos;.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit.
