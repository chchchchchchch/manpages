NAME
       wireless - Wireless Tools and Wireless Extensions

SYNOPSIS
       iwconfig
       iwpriv -a

DESCRIPTION
       The  Wireless  Extensions  is an API allowing you manipulate Wireless LAN
       networking interfaces.  It is composed of a variety of tools and configu&#8208;
       ration  files.  It is documented in more detail in the Linux Wireless LAN
       Howto.
       The Wireless Tools are used to change the configuration of  wireless  LAN
       networking  interfaces on the fly, to get their current configuration, to
       get statistics and diagnose them. They are described  in  their  own  man
       page, see below for references.
       Wireless  configuration  is specific to each Linux distribution. This man
       page will contain in the future the configuration  procedure  for  a  few
       common  distributions.  For  the  time  being,  check  the file DISTRIBU&#8208;
       TIONS.txt included with the Wireless Tools package.
