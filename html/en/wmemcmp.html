WMEMCMP(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WMEMCMP(3)



NAME
       wmemcmp - compare two arrays of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *s1, const wchar_t *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wmemcmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the memcmp(3)
       function.  It compares the n wide-characters starting at  s1  and  the  n
       wide-characters starting at s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wmemcmp() function returns zero if the wide-character arrays of size
       n at s1 and s2 are equal.  It returns an integer greater than zero if  at
       the  first differing position i (i &lt; n), the corresponding wide-character
       s1[i] is greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than zero if  at
       the  first differing position i (i &lt; n), the corresponding wide-character
       s1[i] is less than s2[i].

CONFORMING TO
       C99.
