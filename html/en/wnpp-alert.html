WNPP-ALERT(1)                                                      WNPP-ALERT(1)



NAME
       wnpp-alert - check for installed packages up for adoption or orphaned

SYNOPSIS
       wnpp-alert [--diff] [package ...]
       wnpp-alert --help|--version

DESCRIPTION
       wnpp-alert  downloads the lists of packages which have been orphaned (O),
       are up for adoption (RFA), or the maintainer has  asked  for  help  (RFH)
       from  the WNPP webpages, and then outputs a list of packages installed on
       the system, or matching the listed packages, which are in those lists.

       Note that WNPP, and therefore  wnpp-alert&apos;s  output,  is  source  package
       based.

OPTIONS
       --diff, -d
              If the ~/.devscripts_cache directory exists, compare the output of
              wnpp-alert to the previous output (cached in the  file  wnpp-diff)
              and output the differences.

       --help, -h
              Show a summary of options.

       --version, -v
              Show version and copyright information.
