WORDEXP(3)                  Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                 WORDEXP(3)



NAME
       wordexp, wordfree - perform word expansion like a posix-shell

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;wordexp.h&gt;

       int wordexp(const char *s, wordexp_t *p, int flags);

       void wordfree(wordexp_t *p);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wordexp(), wordfree(): _XOPEN_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  wordexp()  performs a shell-like expansion of the string s
       and returns the result in the structure pointed to by p.  The  data  type
       wordexp_t is a structure that at least has the fields we_wordc, we_wordv,
       and we_offs.  The field we_wordc is a size_t that  gives  the  number  of
       words in the expansion of s.  The field we_wordv is a char ** that points
       to the array of words found.  The field we_offs of type size_t  is  some&#8208;
       times (depending on flags, see below) used to indicate the number of ini&#8208;
       tial elements in the we_wordv array that should be filled with NULLs.

       The function wordfree() frees the  allocated  memory  again.   More  pre&#8208;
       cisely,  it  does  not free its argument, but it frees the array we_wordv
       and the strings that points to.

   The string argument
       Since the expansion is the same as the expansion by the shell (see sh(1))
       of  the parameters to a command, the string s must not contain characters
       that would be illegal in shell command parameters.  In particular,  there
       must not be any unescaped newline or |, &amp;, ;, &lt;, &gt;, (, ), {, } characters
       outside a command substitution or parameter substitution context.

       If the argument s contains a word that starts with  an  unquoted  comment
       character  #,  then it is unspecified whether that word and all following
       words are ignored, or the # is treated as a non-comment character.

   The expansion
       The expansion done consists of  the  following  stages:  tilde  expansion
       (replacing   ~user  by  user&apos;s  home  directory),  variable  substitution
       (replacing $FOO by the value of the environment  variable  FOO),  command
       substitution  (replacing  $(command)  or  `command` by the output of com&#8208;
       mand), arithmetic expansion, field splitting, wildcard  expansion,  quote
       removal.

       The  result  of  expansion of special parameters ($@, $*, $#, $?, $-, $$,
       $!, $0) is unspecified.

       Field splitting is done using the environment variable $IFS.   If  it  is
       not set, the field separators are space, tab and newline.

   The output array
       The array we_wordv contains the words found, followed by a NULL.

   The flags argument
       The flag argument is a bitwise inclusive OR of the following values:

       WRDE_APPEND
              Append  the  words  found  to  the array resulting from a previous
              call.

       WRDE_DOOFFS
              Insert we_offs initial NULLs in the array  we_wordv.   (These  are
              not counted in the returned we_wordc.)

       WRDE_NOCMD
              Don&apos;t do command substitution.

       WRDE_REUSE
              The  argument  p  resulted  from a previous call to wordexp(), and
              wordfree() was not called.  Reuse the allocated storage.

       WRDE_SHOWERR
              Normally during  command  substitution  stderr  is  redirected  to
              /dev/null.   This  flag  specifies  that stderr is not to be redi&#8208;
              rected.

       WRDE_UNDEF
              Consider it an error if an undefined shell variable is expanded.

RETURN VALUE
       In case of success 0 is returned.  In case of error one of the  following
       five values is returned.

       WRDE_BADCHAR
              Illegal occurrence of newline or one of |, &amp;, ;, &lt;, &gt;, (, ), {, }.

       WRDE_BADVAL
              An  undefined  shell  variable  was referenced, and the WRDE_UNDEF
              flag told us to consider this an error.

       WRDE_CMDSUB
              Command substitution occurred, and the WRDE_NOCMD flag told us  to
              consider this an error.

       WRDE_NOSPACE
              Out of memory.

       WRDE_SYNTAX
              Shell  syntax  error,  such as unbalanced parentheses or unmatched
              quotes.

VERSIONS
       wordexp() and wordfree() are provided in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

EXAMPLE
       The output of the following example program is approximately that of  &quot;ls
       [a-c]*.c&quot;.

       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wordexp.h&gt;

       int
       main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
           wordexp_t p;
           char **w;
           int i;

           wordexp(&quot;[a-c]*.c&quot;, &amp;p, 0);
           w = p.we_wordv;
           for (i = 0; i &lt; p.we_wordc; i++)
               printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, w[i]);
           wordfree(&amp;p);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
