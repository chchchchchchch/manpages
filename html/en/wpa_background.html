WPA_BACKGROUND(8)                                              WPA_BACKGROUND(8)



NAME
       wpa_background  -  Background  information  on Wi-Fi Protected Access and
       IEEE 802.11i

WPA
       The original security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was not  designed
       to  be  strong  and  has proven to be insufficient for most networks that
       require some kind of security. Task group I  (Security)  of  IEEE  802.11
       working  group  (http://www.ieee802.org/11/)  has  worked  to address the
       flaws of the base standard and has in practice completed its work in  May
       2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard was approved
       in June 2004 and published in July 2004.

       Wi-Fi Alliance (http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a draft version of  the  IEEE
       802.11i  work (draft 3.0) to define a subset of the security enhancements
       that can be implemented with existing wlan hardware. This is called Wi-Fi
       Protected  Access&lt;TM&gt; (WPA). This has now become a mandatory component of
       interoperability testing and certification done by Wi-Fi Alliance.  Wi-Fi
       provides   information   about   WPA  at  its  web  site  (http://www.wi-
       fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).

       IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP) algorithm for
       protecting  wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with 40-bit keys, 24-bit ini&#8208;
       tialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to protect against packet forgery. All
       these  choices  have  proven  to  be insufficient: key space is too small
       against current attacks, RC4 key scheduling is insufficient (beginning of
       the  pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV space is too small and IV
       reuse makes attacks easier, there is no replay protection, and  non-keyed
       authentication does not protect against bit flipping packet data.

       WPA is an intermediate solution for the security issues. It uses Temporal
       Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP. TKIP  is  a  compromise  on
       strong  security  and possibility to use existing hardware. It still uses
       RC4 for the encryption like WEP, but with per-packet RC4 keys.  In  addi&#8208;
       tion, it implements replay protection, keyed packet authentication mecha&#8208;
       nism (Michael MIC).

       Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can either use an
       external  authentication  server  (e.g.,  RADIUS)  and EAP just like IEEE
       802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without need for  additional  servers.
       Wi-Fi calls these &quot;WPA-Enterprise&quot; and &quot;WPA-Personal&quot;, respectively. Both
       mechanisms will generate a master session key for the Authenticator  (AP)
       and Supplicant (client station).

       WPA  implements  a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and Group Key Hand&#8208;
       shake) for generating and exchanging data  encryption  keys  between  the
       Authenticator  and Supplicant. This handshake is also used to verify that
       both Authenticator and Supplicant know  the  master  session  key.  These
       handshakes are identical regardless of the selected key management mecha&#8208;
       nism (only the method for generating master session key changes).

IEEE 802.11I / WPA2
       The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included  in  WPA  has
       finished  (May  2004)  and  this amendment to IEEE 802.11 was approved in
       June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE 802.11i as a  new  ver&#8208;
       sion  of  WPA  called  WPA2. This includes, e.g., support for more robust
       encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC) to  replace
       TKIP and optimizations for handoff (reduced number of messages in initial
       key handshake, pre-authentication, and PMKSA caching).
