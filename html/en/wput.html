wput(1)                    Internet Applications - FTP                   wput(1)



NAME
       wput - A wget-like ftp-uploader


SYNOPSIS
       wput [options] file [file ...] URL


DESCRIPTION
       Wput is a free utility that is able to upload files to a ftp-server.

       Wput  is  non-interactive  and background-capable. It can upload files or
       whole directories and is meant to be a robust client  even  for  unstable
       connections  and will therefore retry to upload a file, if the connection
       broke.

       Wput supports resuming, so it automatically continues uploading from  the
       point  where  the previous upload stopped, meaning that you can kill Wput
       anytime and it will (if the remote ftp-server supports this,  being  most
       likely the case) finish the partial uploaded file.

       Wput  supports  connections through proxies, allowing you to use it in an
       environment that can access the internet only via a proxy or  to  provide
       anonymity  by  hiding your ip-address to the server.  For SOCKSv5-proxies
       Wput supports also listening mode, allowing  you  to  use  port-mode  ftp
       through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is behind a firewall or a gate&#8208;
       way).

       Wput supports timestamping, so it will (in the ideal case and  if  times&#8208;
       tamping  is  enabled)  only upload files, that are newer than the remote-
       file.

       The upload-rate of Wput can be restricted, so that  Wput  won&apos;t  eat  all
       available bandwidth.

   URL-Input-Handling
       URLs are recognized by the ftp://-prefix

       Wput  first  reads  the  URLs from command-line, and associates the first
       file with the first URL, the second file with the  second  URL  etc.   It
       then  transmits  the  file/URL  combinations  that  are already complete.
       Afterwards, Wput uses the --input-file (if any) and reads the URLs  using
       the  same  sheme  as above.  In situations where more URLs than files are
       specified, Wput tries to guess the local filename from the URL.  In  case
       there  are  more  files that URLs remaining, Wput uses the last known URL
       for each of the files.

       So you can specify e.g. one URL and read all filenames from a  file.   Or
       use   wput   *.txt   ftp://host,   to   transfer  all  *.txt-files.   See
       doc/USAGE.examples for further examples.

       To be on the safe side, it is recommended to supply the files before  the
       URLs.

   Guessing Local File
       If  Wput has an URL without a corresponding filename, Wput tries to guess
       the  local   file&apos;s   location.   e.g.   using   wput   ftp://host/direc&#8208;
       tory/path/file,  Wput  will  look  out  for  /directory/path/file. If not
       found, Wput looks for ./directory/path/file, ./path/file and ./file.


OPTIONS
   Logging and Input File Options
       -a LOGFILE, --append-output=LOGFILE
              Append all logged messages to logfile.
&#12;       --basename=PATH
              This option causes Wput to snip path  from  all  input-files  when
              they are connected to the URL. wput /usr/share/doc.tgz ftp://host/
              would  create  ftp://host//usr/share/doc.tgz,  whereas  specifying
              /usr/share/  as  basename  will result in ftp://host/doc.tgz being
              created.

       -i FILE, --input-file=FILE
              Reads URLs and filenames from file. If there are URLs on the  com&#8208;
              mand-line  too,  these  will be retrieved first, unless sorting is
              enabled.  See also the URL-Input-Handling section.

              If file is -, the URLs will be read from stdin.  If  you  want  to
              pipe  the  contents  of  the file that shall be uploaded to stdin,
              this cannot be done (yet). But you can use the  --input-pipe  flag
              and  read  the  contents  a) from a named pipe -I &quot;cat named.pipe;
              echo &gt; /dev/null&quot; or b) directly from the  command,  that  outputs
              the data. (See --input-pipe)

              Do  not  do  things like find | wput ftp://host/ -i -!  Wput would
              upload all files from the current directory (since the first  out&#8208;
              put  of  find  will  be &apos;.&apos;) and afterwards each file again (since
              find postes its name to Wput. And further problematic is that Wput
              will  upload  each  directory that is given by find and since find
              itself recurses all directories, the files would be uploaded three
              times  (or  even more often for further subdirectories).  Use wput
              ftp://host/ to upload everything from the local directory.  Or use
              find ! -type d | wput ftp://host/ -i - to tell find, not to output
              directories.

       -I COMMAND, --input-pipe=COMMAND
              If no file/directory can be &quot;guessed&quot; (see &quot;Guessing Local  File&quot;)
              from  the  URL, the output of command is taken as file-input. com&#8208;
              mand is invoked as follows:

                     command ftp &quot;username&quot;  &quot;ip/hostname&quot;  port  &quot;remote_direc&#8208;
              tory&quot; &quot;remote_filename&quot;

              The  hostname  is  only supplied if the ip cannot be resolved.  If
              you do not want these parameters to confuse the program from which
              you  read  the  contents, use something like &apos;-I &quot;cat file; echo &gt;
              /dev/null&quot;&apos; so that these parameters are passed  to  echo  and  to
              /dev/null  afterwards.   Since  the  progressbar is not capable of
              handling unknown filesizes, the filesize is set to 1  GiB.  There&#8208;
              fore the ETA shows a wrong value.

       -nv, --less-verbose
              Be  less  verbose. That means reducing Wput&apos;s output to a minimun.
              Specifiing this flag more often is  equal  to  the  --quiet  flag.
              Some  people also like combining the -v and -nv flags, being quite
              senseless.

       -o LOGFILE, --output-file=LOGFILE
              Log all messages to logfile.

       -q, --quiet
              Turn off Wput&apos;s output.

       -R, --remove-source-files
              Unlinks/deletes files that have been successfully transmitted.

       -s, --sort
              If sorting is enabled Wput first reads all URLs  from  any  input-
              devices  available  and  will  sort  them before transmitting each
              file.

              The sorting  order  is:  ip/hostname,  port,  username,  password,
              directory, filename.  Sorting requires a bit more memory since all
              data needs to be hold there.
&#12;       -v, --verbose
              Turn on verbose output. This gives  some  more  information  about
              what Wput does. If you specify this flag twice, you get debug out&#8208;
              put.


   Upload Options
       -A, --ascii
              Wput automatically determines which  transfer-format  to  use,  by
              looking  at  the  file-extensions. Certain files are recognized as
              ASCII. These are: txt, c, java, cpp, sh, f, f90,  f77,  f95,  bas,
              pro,  csh,  ksh, conf, htm, html, php, pl, cgi, inf, js, asp, bat,
              cfm, css, dhtml, diz, h, hpp, ini, mak, nfo, shtml, shtm, tcl, pas

              Specifying this flag forces Wput to use ASCII mode file transfers.

       -b, --background
              Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file  is
              given, wput will redirect its output to &quot;./wputlog&quot;

       -B, --binary
              Specifying  this  flag  forces Wput to use BINARY mode file trans&#8208;
              fers.

       --bind-address=ADDRESS
              When making  client  TCP/IP  connections,  bind()  to  ADDRESS  to
              ADDRESS  on the local machine. ADDRESS may be specified as a host&#8208;
              name or IP address. This option can be useful if your  machine  is
              bound  to multiple IPs.  --force-tls If this flag is specified and
              Wput is linked with the OpenSSL-library,  the  flag  enforces  the
              usage  of TLS: If no TLS-connection can be established the process
              will cancel and not try to go on with an unencrypted connection.

   Basic Startup Options
       -l RATE, --limit-rate=RATE
              If you don&apos;t want Wput to eat up all available bandwidth,  specify
              this  flag.   RATE is a numeric value. The units &apos;K&apos; (for KiB) and
              &apos;M&apos; (for MiB) are understood.

              The upload rate is limited on average, meaning that if  you  limit
              the  rate  to  10K  and Wput was just able to send with 5K for the
              first seconds, it will send (if possible) afterwards more than 10K
              until the average rate of 10K is fulfilled.

       -m, --chmod
              This  will  change  the  access mode of the transferred files. The
              format is the three-digit octal unix  mode,  e.g.  644  means  rw-
              r--r--.

       -nc, --dont-continue
              If  this  flag  is specified, resuming will be turned off, meaning
              that a remote file being smaller than the local one will be  over&#8208;
              written. To skip this file, you have to enable --skip-existing.

              See also doc/USAGE.resumehandling

       -N, --timestamping
              If  timestamping  is  enabled, Wput will retrieve a directory list
              and parse it to determine the remote file-date. If the local  file
              is newer than the remote one (there is a default allowed timevari&#8208;
              ance of 5 seconds, which can be adjusted in the wputrc-file) it is
              uploaded, otherwise skipped.

              The  local  date  is dermined by the mtime (time of last modifica&#8208;
              tion), using the current time-zone. This should be  equal  to  the
              output of ls -l.

              Since you usually do not want to resume existing files, you should
              employ the --reupload --dont-continue flags as well.
&#12;       -p, --port-mode
              Per default, Wput uses passive mode ftp, which works well for most
              configurations.  If  passive  mode fails, Wput automatically falls
              back to port mode.

              If you want Wput to start using port mode ftp, specify this flag.

       --proxy=MODE
              Alias is option -Y. The MODE can be  either  http  for  http-based
              proxies  (such as SQUID), socks for SOCKSv5 proxies or off to dis&#8208;
              able the proxy.

       --proxy-user=NAME
              If the proxy-server requires authentication,  use  NAME  as  user-
              name.  You need to specify --proxy-pass too. These information can
              also be stored in the wputrc-file.

       --proxy-pass=PASSWORD
              Specifies the password to use for the proxy.

   FTP Options
       --no-directories
              If Wput is unable to CWD into a directory, it will try  to  create
              it.  If  this  is  not  the desired behaviour specify this flag to
              force Wput not to create any directories.

       -t NUMBER, --tries=NUMBER
              Set number of retries to number. Specify -1 for infinite retrying,
              which is default, too.

       -u, --reupload
              If  this  flag is specified, a remote file having the same size as
              the local one is to be uploaded. Skipping is default.

       --skip-larger
              If this flag is specified, a remote file  being  larger  than  the
              local one will be skipped. Default is reuploading it.

       --skip-existing
              If this flag is specified, the upload of a file will be skipped if
              the remote file already exists.

   General options
       -V, --version
              Display the version of wput.

       -h, --help
              Print a help screen, with a short description of  wput&apos;s  command-
              line options.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Normally,  the  exit  status is 0 if either everything went fine or there
       was nothing to do.  If some files were skipped during the upload (due  to
       timestamping  or resume-rules) the exit status is set to 1. If some files
       failed to be transmitted due to an remote error, exit  status  is  2.  If
       some  files  failed  and  some others were skipped, exit status is 3. For
       general problems like failure of some system-functions the exit status is
       4.


BUGS
       You  are  welcome  to send bug reports and suggestions about Wput through
       the      Sourceforge       Bugtracking       System:       http://source&#8208;
       forge.net/tracker/?group_id=141519

       Please  send  all available information that might concern this bug (e.g.
       Operating System and what can be done to  reproduce  the  error).  Supply
       also  the debug-output (but remove confidential data if any), which helps
       a lot analysing the problem. If you use a wputrc file, it might  also  be
       useful to provide the relevant parts of it.

       If  there  is  a  crash  due to a segfault or similar, try to run it in a
       debugger, e.g. gdb /usr/bin/wput core and type where  to  get  the  back&#8208;
       trace.  It would also be great help if you could recompile wput with mem&#8208;
       ory-debugging support (make clean; make memdbg; [make install])  and  use
       this debug-dump.


SEE ALSO
       Many  options  can be set in a wputrc file. For its documentation consult
       the sample file provided by Wput.  There are some USAGE.*  files  in  the
       doc/  directory of Wput. These contain further information and samples on
       how to use Wput.
