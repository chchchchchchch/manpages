WRAP-AND-SORT(1)                                                WRAP-AND-SORT(1)



NAME
       wrap-and-sort - wrap long lines and sort items in Debian packaging files

SYNOPSIS
       wrap-and-sort [options]


DESCRIPTION
       wrap-and-sort wraps the package lists in Debian control files. By default
       the lists will only split into multiple lines if the entries  are  longer
       than  80 characters. wrap-and-sort sorts the package lists in Debian con&#8208;
       trol files and all .install  files.  Beside  that  wrap-and-sort  removes
       trailing spaces in these files.

       This  script  should  be  run  in  the  root of a Debian package tree. It
       searches for control, control.in, copyright, copyright.in,  install,  and
       *.install in the debian directory.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit.

       -a, --wrap-always
              Wrap  all  package  lists  in  the Debian control file even if the
              entries are shorter than 80 characters and could fit in  one  line
              line.

       -s, --short-indent
              Only  indent  wrapped  lines by one space (default is in-line with
              the field name).

       -b, --sort-binary-packages
              Sort binary package paragraphs by name.

       -k, --keep-first
              When sorting binary package paragraphs, leave the first one at the

              the first package.

       -n, --no-cleanup
              Do not remove trailing whitespaces.

       -d path, --debian-directory=path

              if no files are specified.

       -v, --verbose
              Print all files that are touched.
