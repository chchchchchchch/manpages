WRJPGCOM(1)                                                          WRJPGCOM(1)



NAME
       wrjpgcom - insert text comments into a JPEG file

SYNOPSIS
       wrjpgcom [ -replace ] [ -comment text ] [ -cfile name ] [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       wrjpgcom reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file
       is named, and generates a new JPEG/JFIF file on standard output.  A  com&#8208;
       ment block is added to the file.

       The  JPEG  standard  allows &quot;comment&quot; (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG
       file.  Although the standard doesn&apos;t actually define what COM blocks  are
       for,  they are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings.  This lets
       you add annotations, titles, index terms, etc to  your  JPEG  files,  and
       later  retrieve them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image
       stored in the JPEG file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you
       can have as many of them as you like in one JPEG file.

       wrjpgcom  adds  a COM block, containing text you provide, to a JPEG file.
       Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any existing COM blocks; but you
       can delete the old COM blocks if you wish.

OPTIONS
       Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not case sensitive.

       -replace
              Delete any existing COM blocks from the file.

       -comment text
              Supply text for new COM block on command line.

       -cfile name
              Read text for new COM block from named file.

       If  you  have only one line of comment text to add, you can provide it on
       the command line with -comment.  The comment text must be surrounded with
       quotes  so  that it is treated as a single argument.  Longer comments can
       be read from a text file.

       If you give neither -comment nor -cfile, then wrjpgcom will read the com&#8208;
       ment  text  from  standard input.  (In this case an input image file name
       MUST be supplied, so that the  source  JPEG  file  comes  from  somewhere
       else.)   You can enter multiple lines, up to 64KB worth.  Type an end-of-
       file indicator (usually control-D) to terminate the comment text entry.

       wrjpgcom will not add a COM block  if  the  provided  comment  string  is
       empty.   Therefore  -replace  -comment  &quot;&quot;  can be used to delete all COM
       blocks from a file.

EXAMPLES
       Add a short comment to in.jpg, producing out.jpg:

              wrjpgcom -c &quot;View of my back yard&quot; in.jpg &gt; out.jpg

       Attach a long comment previously stored in comment.txt:

              wrjpgcom in.jpg &lt; comment.txt &gt; out.jpg

       or equivalently

              wrjpgcom -cfile comment.txt &lt; in.jpg &gt; out.jpg
