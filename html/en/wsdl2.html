NAME
       wsdl - Mono&apos;s Web Service Proxy Generator

SYNOPSIS
       wsdl [options] [path | url]

DESCRIPTION
       wsdl is a tool for generating proxy classes that can be used to access to
       web services.  The tool reads a WSDL document from the provided  path  or
       url, and downloads referenced schemas or other WSDL documents if needed.

       This  tool  is  used  to  target the 1.x API, for targetting the 2.x API,
       please use the wsdl2 tool.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -appsettingurlkey:key -urlkey:key
              Specifies that the url for the services should be  read  from  the
              &lt;appsettings&gt;  section  of  the configuration file, using the pro&#8208;
              vided key.

       -appsettingbaseurl:url , -baseurl:url
              Specifies a base URL for the service. The final URL will  be  con&#8208;
              structed  by  combining  this  value  with  the  URL read from the
              -appsettingurlkey option, and the -type:typename, assembly  Gener&#8208;
              ate  a  proxy  for a compiled web service class. The URL parameter
              can be used to  providethe  location  of  the  service.   location
              attribute specified in the WSDL document.

       -language:language , -l
              Language  of  the code to generate. It can be CS for C# (default),
              Boo for Boo and VB for Visual.Basic.

       Alternatively you can specify a full type name for a CodeProvider, for
              example, you could use this to generate  code  for  the  imaginary
              &quot;MyLan&quot; language which has the following full type:
                   wsdl myservice.wsdl -language:MyLan.MyLanCodeProvider, MyLan.CodeDom, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=xxyy&apos;

       -namespace:name , -n:name
              The  namespace of the generated classes. If none is specified, the
              default namespace is used.

       -out:filename , -o:filename
              The target file for generated code.

       -protocol:protocol , -p:protocol
              The protocol for which to generate code. It can be Soap (default),
              HttpGet or HttpPost.

       -sample:METHOD
              This  will display XML request and reply of the sample invocations
              to that SOAP message.  You can use the -protocol: option to render
              the message in different forms.

       -server
              Generate a server skeleton instead of a client proxy.
