Name
       wsgen - Java(TM) API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) 2.0

       Specification Version: 2.1
       Implementation Version: 2.1.1

       The  wsgen  tool  generates  JAX-WS portable artifacts used in JAX-WS web
       services. The tool reads a  web  service  endpoint  implementation  class
       (SEI)  and  generates  all the required artifacts for web service deploy&#8208;
       ment, and invocation

Overview
       The wsgen tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts  used  in  JAX-WS  web
       services.  The  tool reads a web service endpoint class and generates all
       the required artifacts for web service deployment, and invocation.  JAXWS
       2.1.1 RI also provides a wsgen ant task, see Wsgen ant task @
       https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/nonav/2.1.1/docs/wsgenant.html for details.

Launching wsgen
          o Solaris/Linux

             * export JAXWS_HOME=/pathto/jaxws-ri

             * $JAXWS_HOME/bin/wsgen.sh -help

          o Windows

             * set JAXWS_HOME=c:\pathto\jaxws-ri

             * %JAXWS_HOME%\bin\wsgen.bat -help


Syntax
       wsgen [options] &lt;SEI&gt;

       The following table lists the wsgen options.

       Option                Description
       -classpath &lt;path&gt;     Specify where to find input
                             class files
       -cp &lt;path&gt;            Same as -classpath &lt;path&gt;
       -d &lt;directory&gt;        Specify where to place gen&#8208;
                             erated output files
       -extension            allow vendor extensions
                             (functionality not speci&#8208;
                             fied by the specification).
                             Use of extensions may
                             result in applications that
                             are not portable or may not
                             interoperate with other
                             implementations
       -help                 Display help
       -keep                 Keep generated files
       -r &lt;directory&gt;        Used only in conjunction
                             with the -wsdl option.
                             Specify where to place gen&#8208;
                             erated resource files such
                             as WSDLs
       -s &lt;directory&gt;        Specify where to place gen&#8208;
                             erated source files
       -verbose              Output messages about what
                             the compiler is doing
       -version              Print version information.
                             Use of this option will
                             ONLY print version informa&#8208;
                             tion. Normal processing
                             will not occur.
       -wsdl[:protocol]      By default wsgen does not
                             generate a WSDL file. This
                             flag is optional and will
                             cause wsgen to generate a
                             WSDL file and is usually
                             only used so that the
                             developer can look at the
                             WSDL before the endpoint is
                             deploy. The protocol is
                             optional and is used to
                             specify what protocol
                             should be used in the
                             wsdl:binding. Valid proto&#8208;
                             cols include: soap1.1 and
                             Xsoap1.2. The default is
                             soap1.1. Xsoap1.2 is not
                             standard and can only be
                             used in conjunction with
                             the -extension option.
       -servicename &lt;name&gt;   Used only in conjunction
                             with the -wsdl option. Used
                             to specify a particular
                             wsdl:service name to be
                             generated in the WSDL.
                             Example, -servicename
                             &quot;{http://mynames&#8208;
                             pace/}MyService&quot;
       -portname &lt;name&gt;      Used only in conjunction
                             with the -wsdl option. Used
                             to specify a particular
                             wsdl:port name to be gener&#8208;
                             ated in the WSDL. Example,
                             -portname &quot;{http://mynames&#8208;
                             pace/}MyPort&quot;
&#12;Example
       wsgen -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       This will generate the wrapper classes needed for StockService annotated
       with @WebService annotation inside stockdirectory.
       wsgen -wsdl -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       This will generate a SOAP 1.1 WSDL and schema for your Java class
       stock.StockService annotated with @WebService annotation.
       wsgen -wsdl:Xsoap1.2 -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       Will generate a SOAP 1.2 WSDL.

       Note that you do not have to generate WSDL at the development time as
       JAXWS runtime will automatically generate a WSDL for you when you deploy
       your service.
