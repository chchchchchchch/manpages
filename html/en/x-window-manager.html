OPENBOX(1)                    Openbox documentation                   OPENBOX(1)



NAME
       Openbox - standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible window
       manager.

SYNOPSIS
       openbox [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to
       manage.  This is because the approach to its development was the opposite
       of what seems to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was
       written first to comply with standards and to work properly. Only when
       that was in place did the team turn to the visual interface.

       Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can
       be used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the
       GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

       Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based
       upon any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been
       based upon that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0
       codebase.

OPTIONS
       --sm-disable
            Disable connection to session manager.

       --sm-client-id &lt;ID&gt;
            Specify session management ID.

       --sm-save-file &lt;FILE&gt;
            Specify file to load a saved session from.

       --replace
            Replace the currently running window manager.

       --help
            Display some help and exit.

       --version
            Display the version and exit.

       --sync
            Run in synchronous mode (this is slow and meant for debugging X
            routines).

       --debug
            Display debugging output.
