XAUTOMATION(7)                                                    XAUTOMATION(7)



NAME
       xautomation  -  control  X  from the command line, and find things on the
       screen

DESCRIPTION
       xautomation is a set of command lines programs to control X and do  &quot;vis&#8208;
       ual  scraping&quot; to find things on the screen. The control interface allows
       mouse movement, clicking, button up/down, key up/down, etc, and uses  the
       XTest extension so you don&apos;t have the annoying problems that xse has when
       apps ignore sent events. The visgrep program find images inside of images
       and  reports  the coordinates, allowing programs to find buttons, etc, on
       the screen to click on.

       xautomation consists in the following programs:

       pat2ppm
              Converts an image file from PAT to PPM format.

       patextract
              Extract a part of a PNG image file.

       png2pat
              Converts an image file from PNG to PAT format.

       rgb2pat
              Converts an image file from 24-bit RGB to PAT format

       visgrep
              Visual grep, greps for images in another image.

       xte    Generates fake input using the XTest extension.


       For more information, please see the individual manpages  of  these  pro&#8208;
       grams.
