xbuild(1)                                                              xbuild(1)



NAME
       xbuild - Mono&apos;s tool to build MSBuild project files

SYNOPSIS
       xbuild [option] [project-file]

DESCRIPTION
       xbuild can be used to build MSBuild project files. Integrated Development
       Environments like MonoDevelop and  &quot;Microsoft  Visual  Studio  .NET&quot;  use
       msbuild project file format.

       xbuild  takes  the  path of the project or solution file to build, as the
       main argument.  If no file is specified then it tries to build any  solu&#8208;
       tion  file  or  project  file  in the current directory, that has a *proj
       extension.

OPTIONS
       /target:T1[,TN]
              List of targets to build

       /property:Name=Value
              Set or override project properties

       /logger:&lt;logger&gt;
              Custom logger to log build events

       /toolsversion:version , /tv:version
              Specify the toolset version to use.

              Eg. /tv:4.0
                  This would cause 4.0 version of  the  Microsoft.Common.targets
              (among others) to be used. This overrides
                  the value specified in a project file.

              Valid values: 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0

       /verbosity:&lt;level&gt;
              Logger  verbosity  level : quiet, minimal, normal, detailed, diag&#8208;
              nostic

       /validate
              Validate the project file against the schema

       /validate:&lt;schema&gt;
              Validate the project file against the specified schema

       /consoleloggerparameters:&lt;params&gt; , /clp:&lt;params&gt;
              Parameters for the console logger  :  PerfomanceSummary,  Summary,
              NoSummary, NoItemAndPropertyList, Verbosity

       /filelogger[n] , /fl[n]
              Logs  the output to a file, named &apos;msbuild.log&apos; by default. If the
              optional number &apos;n&apos; is specified, then it logs to &apos;msbuild[n].log&apos;
              .  Parameters  for this logger, including the log file name can be
              specified via a corresponding /flp[n]  option.  Default  verbosity
              for file loggers is &apos;detailed. &apos;n&apos; can be between 1-9.

       /fileloggerparameters[n]:&lt;params&gt; , /flp[n]:&lt;params&gt;
              Parameters for a file logger. This implies a corresponding /fl[n].
              &apos;n&apos; can be between 1-9, and is used to add upto 10  file  loggers.
              Parameters can be, besides the ones available for console logger:
&#12;              LogFile=&lt;file&gt;
                     File to which the build log will be written.

              Append If  this  is used, then the log file is appended to, else a
                     new one will be created.

              Encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
                     Encoding to use for the log file, eg. UTF-8, ASCII.

              Eg:   xbuild    foo.csproj    /flp:Verbosity=normal    &quot;/flp1:Log&#8208;
              File=build.log;Append;Encoding=ASCII&quot;

       /nologo
              Don&apos;t show the initial xbuild banner

       /help  Show xbuild usage

       /version
              Display xbuild version

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       XBUILD_EMIT_SOLUTION
              If  this  variable  is set, then the project file generated from a
              solution file is emitted.

       XBUILD_LOG_REFERENCE_RESOLVER
              References are resolved by trying a list of assembly search  paths
              ($(AssemblySearchPaths)).  If xbuild is unable to resolve a refer&#8208;
              ence, then it logs details of why the various search paths failed.
              If this variable is set, then it logs the same even for references
              that were resolved successfully. These logs show up  if  the  ver&#8208;
              bosity is set to detailed or higher.

       MSBuildExtensionsPath
              MSBuild  extensions  are  usually installed in $(MSBuildExtension&#8208;
              sPath), which xbuild resolves to  $prefix/lib/mono/xbuild  .  When
              used in Import, like:

                &lt;Import Project=&quot;$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\TestTargets.targets&quot;/&gt;

              xbuild  tries various values for the msbuild property $(MSBuildEx&#8208;
              tensionsPath), in order:

                1. Paths specified in the  environment  variable  $MSBuildExten&#8208;
              sionsPath.
                2.   /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/xbuild  on  Mac
              OSX.
                3.   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xbuild/tasks   (or    Environment.Special&#8208;
              Folder.ApplicationData)
                4. $prefix/lib/mono/xbuild (default location)

              Anywhere  else in the project files, $(MSBuildExtensionsPath) will
              always resolve to the default location. This is a xbuild-only fea&#8208;
              ture.   This is also applicable for the properties $(MSBuildExten&#8208;
              sionsPath32) and $(MSBuildExtensionsPath64), and  the  environment
              variables   have   the  corresponding  names  -  MSBuildExtension&#8208;
              sPath32/64 .

       XBUILD_FRAMEWORK_FOLDERS_PATH
              With ToolsVersion 4.0, projects can  target  arbitrary  frameworks
              referenced by TargetFrameworkMoniker, which is of the format:

                Identifier,Version=&lt;version&gt;[,Profile=&lt;profile&gt;]

              Eg. &quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0&quot;
&#12;              The 3 parts of the moniker are given by the msbuild properties:

                $(TargetFrameworkIdentifier),    $(TargetFrameworkVersion)   and
              $(TargetFrameworkProfile)

              This moniker maps to a framework description file on disk:

                &lt;framework_root&gt;/Identifier/Version/[Profile]/RedistList/Frame&#8208;
              workList.xml

              This  file  is used to determine the path where to find the frame&#8208;
              work assemblies for this particular framework.

              Framework root here is configurable and is resolved in the follow&#8208;
              ing order:

                1. Paths specified in the environment variable $XBUILD_FRAMEWORK_FOLDERS_PATH
                2. /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/xbuild-frameworks on Mac OSX.
                3. MSBuild property $(TargetFrameworkRoot)
                4. $prefix/lib/mono/xbuild-frameworks (default location)

              XBuild  tries  the  paths  given  above, in order, till it finds a
              FrameworkList.xml for the moniker.  Running  with  /v:detailed  or
              higher verbosity will show the various paths that it tries.

              The FrameworkList.xml itself just has a root element like:

                &lt;FileList    Name=&quot;.NET   Framework  3.5&quot;  TargetFrameworkDirec&#8208;
              tory=&quot;..\..\..\..\3.5&quot; IncludeFramework=&quot;v3.0&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/FileList&gt;

              Here the TargetFrameworkDirectory attribute specifies  the  direc&#8208;
              tory  where  the  assemblies  for this particular framework can be
              found. If this is not set, then the parent of the folder  contain&#8208;
              ing the xml file is taken as the framework directory.

              IncludeFramework  attribute  specifies  the version of a framework
              (under the *same* $(TargetFrameworkIdentifier))  which  should  be
              included in the final list of Target framework directories.


       XBUILD_COLORS
              If  this  variable  is  set,  it  contains  a  string  of the form
              &quot;type=foreground,type=..&quot; that specifies which  color  to  use  to
              display errors/warnings etc on some terminals. Type here can be:

                   errors, warnings, messages or events

                   events: These are project/target/task start and end event
                           messages.

              The  possible  colors  for  foreground are: black, red, brightred,
              green,  brightgreen,  yellow,  brightyellow,   blue,   brightblue,
              magenta,   brightmagenta,   cyan,   brightcyan,  grey,  white  and
              brightwhite.

              For example, you could set this variable from your shell:
                   export XBUILD_COLORS
                   XBUILD_COLORS=errors=brightred,warnings=blue

              You can disable the built-in color scheme by setting this variable
              to &quot;disable&quot;.


NOTES
       On  Mac  OSX,  for  locating  pkg-config (.pc) files, xbuild additionally
       looks in &quot;/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/pkgconfig&quot; .
