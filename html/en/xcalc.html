XCALC(1)                                                                XCALC(1)



NAME
       xcalc - scientific calculator for X

SYNOPSIS
       xcalc [-stipple] [-rpn] [-toolkitoption...]

DESCRIPTION
       xcalc  is  a  scientific  calculator desktop accessory that can emulate a
       TI-30 or an HP-10C.

OPTIONS
       xcalc accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with
       two additional options:

       -stipple
               This  option  indicates  that  the  background  of the calculator
               should be drawn using a stipple of the foreground and  background
               colors.  On monochrome displays improves the appearance.

       -rpn    This  option  indicates  that  Reverse  Polish Notation should be
               used.  In this mode the calculator will look and behave  like  an
               HP-10C.  Without this flag, it will emulate a TI-30.

OPERATION
       Pointer  Usage:  Operations may be performed with pointer button 1, or in
       some cases, with the keyboard.  Many common  calculator  operations  have
       keyboard  accelerators.  To quit, press pointer button 3 on the AC key of
       the TI calculator, or the ON key of the HP calculator.

       Calculator Key Usage (TI mode): The numbered keys, the +/- key,  and  the
       +,  -, *, /, and = keys all do exactly what you would expect them to.  It
       should be noted that the operators obey the standard rules of precedence.
       Thus,  entering  &quot;3+4*5=&quot; results in &quot;23&quot;, not &quot;35&quot;.  The parentheses can
       be used to override this.  For  example,  &quot;(1+2+3)*(4+5+6)=&quot;  results  in
       &quot;6*15=90&quot;.

       The  entire number in the calculator display can be selected, in order to
       paste the result of a calculation into text.

       The action procedures associated with  each  function  are  given  below.
       These  are  useful if you are interested in defining a custom calculator.
       The action used for all digit keys is digit(n), where  n  is  the  corre&#8208;
       sponding digit, 0..9.

       1/x       Replaces  the  number  in the display with its reciprocal.  The
                 corresponding action procedure is reciprocal().

       x^2       Squares the number in the display.   The  corresponding  action
                 procedure is square().

       SQRT      Takes the square root of the number in the display.  The corre&#8208;
                 sponding action procedure is squareRoot().

       CE/C      When pressed once, clears the number  in  the  display  without
                 clearing  the  state  of the machine.  Allows you to re-enter a
                 number if you make a mistake.  Pressing  it  twice  clears  the
                 state, also.  The corresponding action procedure for TI mode is
                 clear().

       AC        Clears the display, the state, and  the  memory.   Pressing  it
                 with the third pointer button turns off the calculator, in that
                 it exits the program.  The action procedure to clear the  state
                 is off(); to quit, quit().

       INV       Invert function.  See the individual function keys for details.
                 The corresponding action procedure is inverse().

       sin       Computes the sine of the number in the display, as  interpreted
                 by the current DRG mode (see DRG, below).  If inverted, it com&#8208;
                 putes the  arcsine.   The  corresponding  action  procedure  is
                 sine().

       cos       Computes  the  cosine,  or arccosine when inverted.  The corre&#8208;
                 sponding action procedure is cosine().

       tan       Computes the tangent, or arctangent when inverted.  The  corre&#8208;
                 sponding action procedure is tangent().

       DRG       Changes  the  DRG mode, as indicated by &apos;DEG&apos;, &apos;RAD&apos;, or &apos;GRAD&apos;
                 at the bottom of of the calculator ``liquid crystal&apos;&apos;  display.
                 When  in  &apos;DEG&apos; mode, numbers in the display are taken as being
                 degrees.  In &apos;RAD&apos; mode, numbers are in radians, and in  &apos;GRAD&apos;
                 mode,  numbers  are in grads.  When inverted, the DRG key has a
                 feature of converting degrees to radians  to  grads  and  vice-
                 versa.  Example:  put the calculator into &apos;DEG&apos; mode, and enter
                 &quot;45 INV DRG&quot;.  The display should now show something along  the
                 lines  of  &quot;.785398&quot;, which is 45 degrees converted to radians.
                 The corresponding action procedure is degree().

       e         The constant &apos;e&apos;.  (2.7182818...).   The  corresponding  action
                 procedure is e().

       EE        Used  for  entering  exponential  numbers.  For example, to get
                 &quot;-2.3E-4&quot; you&apos;d enter &quot;2 . 3 +/- EE 4 +/-&quot;.  The  corresponding
                 action procedure is scientific().

       log       Calculates  the  log  (base  10)  of the number in the display.
                 When inverted, it raises &quot;10.0&quot; to the number in  the  display.
                 For example, entering &quot;3 INV log&quot; should result in &quot;1000&quot;.  The
                 corresponding action procedure is logarithm().

       ln        Calculates the log (base e) of the number in the display.  When
                 inverted,  it  raises  &quot;e&quot;  to  the number in the display.  For
                 example, entering &quot;e ln&quot; should result in &quot;1&quot;.  The correspond&#8208;
                 ing action procedure is naturalLog().

       y^x       Raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the
                 right.  For example &quot;2 y^x 3 =&quot; results in &quot;8&quot;, which  is  2^3.
                 For  a  further example, &quot;(1+2+3) y^x (1+2) =&quot; equals &quot;6 y^x 3&quot;
                 which equals &quot;216&quot;.   The  corresponding  action  procedure  is
                 power().

       PI        The  constant  &apos;pi&apos;.  (3.1415927....)  The corresponding action
                 procedure is pi().

       x!        Computes the factorial of the number in the display.  The  num&#8208;
                 ber  in  the  display  must  be  an integer in the range 0-500,
                 though, depending on your math library, it might overflow  long
                 before  that.   The  corresponding  action  procedure is facto&#8208;
                 rial().

       (         Left parenthesis.  The corresponding action  procedure  for  TI
                 calculators is leftParen().

       )         Right  parenthesis.   The corresponding action procedure for TI
                 calculators is rightParen().

       /         Division.  The corresponding action procedure is divide().
&#12;       *         Multiplication.  The corresponding action procedure  is  multi&#8208;
                 ply().

       -         Subtraction.  The corresponding action procedure is subtract().

       +         Addition.  The corresponding action procedure is add().

       =         Perform  calculation.   The  TI-specific  action  procedure  is
                 equal().

       STO       Copies the number in the display to the memory  location.   The
                 corresponding action procedure is store().

       RCL       Copies the number from the memory location to the display.  The
                 corresponding action procedure is recall().

       SUM       Adds the number in the display to  the  number  in  the  memory
                 location.  The corresponding action procedure is sum().

       EXC       Swaps  the  number in the display with the number in the memory
                 location.  The corresponding action procedure for the TI calcu&#8208;
                 lator is exchange().

       +/-       Negate;  change  sign.   The  corresponding action procedure is
                 negate().

       .         Decimal point.  The action procedure is decimal().


       Calculator Key Usage (RPN mode): The number keys, CHS (change  sign),  +,
       -,  *,  /, and ENTR keys all do exactly what you would expect them to do.
       Many of the remaining keys are the same as in TI mode.   The  differences
       are detailed below.  The action procedure for the ENTR key is enter().


       &lt;-        This  is a backspace key that can be used if you make a mistake
                 while entering a number.  It will erase digits  from  the  dis&#8208;
                 play.   (See  BUGS).  Inverse backspace will clear the X regis&#8208;
                 ter.  The corresponding action procedure is back().

       ON        Clears the display, the state, and  the  memory.   Pressing  it
                 with the third pointer button turns off the calculator, in that
                 it exits the program.  To clear state, the action procedure  is
                 off; to quit, quit().

       INV       Inverts the meaning of the function keys.  This would be the  f
                 key on an HP calculator, but xcalc does  not  display  multiple
                 legends  on  each  key.   See  the individual function keys for
                 details.

       10^x      Raises &quot;10.0&quot; to the number in the  top  of  the  stack.   When
                 inverted,  it calculates the log (base 10) of the number in the
                 display.  The corresponding action procedure is tenpower().

       e^x       Raises &quot;e&quot; to the  number  in  the  top  of  the  stack.   When
                 inverted,  it  calculates the log (base e) of the number in the
                 display.  The action procedure is epower().

       STO       Copies the number in the top of the stack to a memory location.
                 There are 10 memory locations.  The desired memory is specified
                 by following this key with a digit key.

       RCL       Pushes the number from the specified memory location  onto  the
                 stack.

       SUM       Adds the number on top of the stack to the number in the speci&#8208;
                 fied memory location.

       x:y       Exchanges the numbers in the top two stack positions, the X and
                 Y  registers.   The  corresponding  action  procedure  is  Xex&#8208;
                 changeY().

       R v       Rolls the stack downward.  When inverted, it  rolls  the  stack
                 upward.  The corresponding action procedure is roll().

       blank     These  keys  were used for programming functions on the HP-10C.
                 Their functionality has not been duplicated in xcalc.

       Finally, there are two additional action procedures: bell(), which  rings
       the  bell;  and selection(), which performs a cut on the entire number in
       the calculator&apos;s ``liquid crystal&apos;&apos; display.

ACCELERATORS
       Accelerators are shortcuts for entering commands.   xcalc  provides  some
       sample keyboard accelerators; also users can customize accelerators.  The
       numeric keypad accelerators provided by xcalc should be intuitively  cor&#8208;
       rect.   The  accelerators defined by xcalc on the main keyboard are given
       below:

                 ENTR Linefeed                      enter()

CUSTOMIZATION
       The application class name is XCalc.

       xcalc has an enormous application defaults file which specifies the posi&#8208;
       tion,  label,  and function of each key on the calculator.  It also gives
       translations to serve as keyboard accelerators.  Because these  resources
       are  not specified in the source code, you can create a customized calcu&#8208;
       lator by writing a private application defaults file,  using  the  Athena
       Command  and  Form  widget  resources to specify the size and position of
       buttons, the label for each button, and the function of each button.

       The foreground and background colors of each calculator key can be  indi&#8208;
       vidually  specified.   For  the TI calculator, a classical color resource
       specification might be:

       XCalc.ti.Command.background:  gray50
       XCalc.ti.Command.foreground:  white

       For each of buttons 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40, specify:
       XCalc.ti.button20.background: black
       XCalc.ti.button20.foreground: white

       For each of buttons 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, and 39:
       XCalc.ti.button22.background: white
       XCalc.ti.button22.foreground: black

WIDGET HIERARCHY
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of  the
       widgets  which  compose  xcalc.  In the notation below, indentation indi&#8208;
       cates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, fol&#8208;
       lowed by the widget instance name.

       XCalc xcalc
            Form  ti  or  hp    (the name depends on the mode)
                 Form  bevel
                      Form  screen
                           Label  M

                 Command  button2
                 Command  button3
       and so on, ...
                 Command  button38
                 Command  button39
                 Command  button40

APPLICATION RESOURCES
       rpn (Class Rpn)
               Specifies  that  the  rpn mode should be used.  The default is TI
               mode.

       stipple (Class Stipple)
               Indicates that the background should be stippled.  The default is
               ``on&apos;&apos; for monochrome displays, and ``off&apos;&apos; for color displays.

       cursor (Class Cursor)
               The  name  of  the  symbol  used  to  represent the pointer.  The
               default is ``hand2&apos;&apos;.

COLORS
       If you would like xcalc to use its ti colors, include  the  following  in
       the #ifdef COLOR section of the file you read with xrdb:

       *customization:                 -color

       This  will  cause  xcalc  to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
       customization file: /etc/X11/app-defaults/XCalc-color.
