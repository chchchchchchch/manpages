NAME
       xcf2pnm - convert from GIMP xcf files to ppm/pgm/pbm format

SYNOPSIS
       xcf2pnm [ options ] filename [ layer names ]

DESCRIPTION
       xcf2pnm  is a command-line tool that converts image files in the XCF for&#8208;
       mat used by gimp(1) to the generic  image  formats  pbm(5),  pgm(5),  and
       ppm(5), flattening layers if necessary. It does not need to have the Gimp
       engine itself available.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -a filename, --alpha filename
               Output a transparency mask for the flattened image to filename as
               a  pgm(5) file, in addition to the ordinary output.  If the flat&#8208;
               tened image is completely opaque, this will produce an error mes&#8208;
               sage and exit status 101; use -A to suppress this.

       -A, --force-alpha
               Invent  a  trivial  alpha  channel even if the flattened image is
               completely opaque.

       -b color, --background color
               Use this color for transparent pixels in the  image.   The  color
               can  be given as #rrggbb or #rgb hexadecimal values, or as an X11
               color name (which will only work if a color name database can  be
               found in one of a number of standard locations).

       -c, --color, --colour
               Force the output to use RGB color space even if it there are more
               compact alternatives.  This will be selected automatically if the
               output file&apos;s name ends with .ppm.

       -C, --autocrop
               Set the converted part of the image such that it just include the
               boundaries of the visible (or selected) layers.  This may make it
               either  smaller or larger than the canvas, depending on the posi&#8208;
               tion and size of the visible layers.  (Note that the contents  of
               the layers is not taken into account when autocropping).

               In  the  absence of options that specify otherwise, the converted
               image will cover the entire XCF canvas.

       -D, --dissolve
               Do a &quot;dissolve&quot; step  to  eliminate  partial  transparency  after
               flattening.   If  -b is also given, this happens before the back&#8208;
               ground color is applied.

       -f, --full-image
               First flatten the entire image to a memory buffer before  writing
               output.  Then  analyse  the image to decide on the details of the
               output format (e.g., whether a grayscale output  is  sufficient).
               Without  this  option,  the  program flattens only a singe row of
               &quot;tiles&quot; (height 64) at a time.

       -g, --gray, --grey
               Force the output to be a grayscale image even if it may be  mono&#8208;
               chrome.   If any colored pixels are encountered, exit with status
               103.  This will be selected automatically if  the  output  file&apos;s
               name ends with .pgm.
&#12;       -G, --for-gif
               Assert that the flattened image will have no partial transparency
               (allowing a more compact representation  of  the  alpha  output).
               Exit  with  status  102  if  the  flattened image has any partial
               transparency.  If -b is also  given,  this  tests  whether  there
               there  is  partial  transparency  before  applying the background
               color.

       -h, --help
               Print an option summery to standard output and exit with a return
               code of 0.

       -j, --bzip
               Equivalent to -Z bzcat.  Default if the filename ends with bz2.

       -m, --mono
               Force  the output to be a monochrome image.  If any colors except
               black and white are encountered, exit with status 103.  This will
               be  selected  automatically  if  the output file&apos;s name ends with
               .pbm.

       -n, --pnm
               Suppress the automatic choice of -c, -g, or -m  based  on  output
               filename,  and  instead  select  the output format based on image
               contents.  This is the default if the filename is not recognized,
               and when writing to stdout.

       -o filename, --output filename
               Write  the  converted  picture to filename instead of to standard
               output.

       -O x,y, --offset x,y
               Offset the converted part of the image from the  top-left  corner
               of the XCF canvas. Usually used with -S.

       -S wxh, --size wxh
               Crop the converted image to width w and height h.

       -T, --truecolor
               Use  standard  RGB  compositing  for  flattening  indexed layers.
               Without this option, xcf2pnm will mimic the Gimp&apos;s current strat&#8208;
               egy  of  rounding each alpha value to either full transparency or
               full opacity, and interpret all layer modes as Normal.

       -u, --utf8
               Use the raw UTF-8 representation from the XCF file to compare and
               display  layer  names.  Ordinarily, layer names will be converted
               to the character set of the current locale.

       -v, --verbose
               Print progress messages about the conversion to standard error.

       -V, --version
               Print the version numer of xcftools to standard output  and  exit
               with a return code of 0.

       -z, --gzip
               Equivalent to -Z zcat.  Default if the filename ends with gz.

       -Z command, --unpack command
               Specify  a command that the input file is filtered through before
               being interpreted as an XCF file. The command is invoked as  com&#8208;
               mand  filename  and  must  produce output to its standard output.
               Note that it is not possible to specify arguments as part of com&#8208;
               mand.   An uncompressor is selected automatically if the filename
               ends with gz or bz2; to suppress  this,  use  -Z  cat  (which  is
               implemented without actually starting a cat(1) process).

       Several  groups  of  options are mutually incompatible; in each group the
       one given last will win:

       1)  -A and -b.

       2)  -c, -g, -m, and -n.

       3)  -D and -G.

       4)  -j, -z, and -Z.

       5)  -C and -O/-S.

LAYER SPECIFICATIONS
       If no layer name is given on the command line, all of the visible  layers
       in  the XCF file are merged to produce the output image.  It is also pos&#8208;
       sible to specify the layers to merge explicitly, by giving their names as
       separate  arguments  after  the  input filename. In that case, the output
       will contain only the named layers. The layers  will  be  merged  in  the
       order  they  appear  on the command line, with the leftmost being &quot;at the
       bottom&quot; - that is, the layer ordering in the XCF file will be ignored.

       The following options can be given after a layer  name  to  override  the
       global properties of the layer:

       --mask  Enable the layer mask.

       --mode mode
               Set the layer mode (e.g., Normal or Multiply).

       --nomask
               Disable the layer mask.

       --opacity n
               Set the opacity on a scale from 0 to 255 (as used internally)

       --percent n
               Set  the  opacity  on  a scale from 0 to 100 (as in the Gimp user
               interface).

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of xcf2pnm is

       0    Success

       20   Problems parsing the command line, including unknown color names (or
            missing color name directory) for -b.

       21   The specified XCF file does not exist or cannot be read.

       22   A  layer  named  on  the  command  line was not found, or the --mask
            option was used for a layer that has no layer mask.

       100  Transparent pixels were found, but neither -a nor -b was given.

       101  The -a option was given yet the image has no transparency.  (Use  -A
            to go on anyway).

       102  The -G option was given, yet partial transparency was found.

       103  -g (or -m) was given, yet colored (or gray) pixels were found.

       123  The  XCF  file contains presumably valid features that xcftools does
            not support.  (As of this writing there is no known way  of  getting
            the  Gimp to write an XCF file that will provoke this return. Please
            notify the author if you discover one).

       125  The XCF file is malformed.

       126  An uncompression program could not be executed, or terminated abnor&#8208;
            mally.

       127  Unexpected  I/O error, internal errors, or other &quot;this can&apos;t happen&quot;
            situations.

       If an uncompression program returns an error exit status,  this  will  be
       returned from xcf2pnm too.

EXAMPLES
              xcf2pnm -b white foo.xcf &gt; foo.ppm

              xcf2pnm -a footrans.pgm -o foo.ppm foo.xcf Layer1 Layer2

       To test whether the flattened image has any transparency, use

              xcf2pnm foo.xcf &gt; /dev/null

       To test whether the flattened image has partially transparent pixels, use

              xcf2pnm -b white -G &gt; /dev/null

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       When  several  partially  transparent layers are merged, the pixel values
       are interpolated without gamma correction. (The Gimp also  does  it  this
       way).  Some  slight  rounding errors in the interpolation are inevitable;
       xcf2pnm sometimes has different rounding errors  than  the  Gimp  itself,
       especially  when more than two layers are involved, or in case of some of
       the more exotic layer modes.  These differences are usually  not  visible
       to the eye.

       Floating selections are currently not handled correctly.

       There  are  probably  other bugs lurking in corner cases. If you discover
       one, please notify the author.
