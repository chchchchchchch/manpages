xcfinfo(1)                                                            xcfinfo(1)



NAME
       xcfinfo - display information about GIMP xcf files

SYNOPSIS
       xcfinfo [ options ] filename

DESCRIPTION
       xcfinfo  is  a command-line tool that displays information about the con&#8208;
       tents of image files in the XCF  format  used  by  gimp(1),  particularly
       about the layers in the image.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               Print an option summery to standard output and exit with a return
               code of 0.

       -j, --bzip
               Equivalent to -Z bzcat.  Default if the filename ends with bz2.

       -u, --utf8
               Use the raw UTF-8 representation from the XCF file to compare and
               display  layer  names.  Ordinarily, layer names will be converted
               to the character set of the current locale.

       -v, --verbose
               Print progress messages about the conversion to standard error.

       -V, --version
               Print the version numer of xcftools to standard output  and  exit
               with a return code of 0.

       -z, --gzip
               Equivalent to -Z zcat.  Default if the filename ends with gz.

       -Z command, --unpack command
               Specify  a command that the input file is filtered through before
               being interpreted as an XCF file. The command is invoked as  com&#8208;
               mand  filename  and  must  produce output to its standard output.
               Note that it is not possible to specify arguments as part of com&#8208;
               mand.   An uncompressor is selected automatically if the filename
               ends with gz or bz2; to suppress  this,  use  -Z  cat  (which  is
               implemented without actually starting a cat(1) process).

OUTPUT
       Information  about  the  image is displayed on standard output in a fixed
       format.  The first line contains general information about the XCF file:

       -  The file format version

       -  The canvas size

       -  The image mode (color, grayscale, or indexed)

       -  The numer of layers

       -  The internal compression algorithm

       Following this line there is a line for each layer:

       1) The character + if the layer is visible and - if it is not

       2) The size and offset of the layer
&#12;       3) The pixel format of the layer, including  whether  the  layer  has  an
          alpha channel.

       4) The  layer  mode, as well as the opacity if not 100%, and /mask if the
          layer has an active layer mask.

       5) The name of the layer.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of xcfinfo is

       0    Success

       20   Problems parsing the command line.

       21   The specified XCF file does not exist or cannot be read.

       123  The XCF file contains presumably valid features that  xcftools  does
            not  support.   (As of this writing there is no known way of getting
            the Gimp to write an XCF file that will provoke this return.  Please
            notify the author if you discover one).

       125  The XCF file is malformed.

       126  An uncompression program could not be executed, or terminated abnor&#8208;
            mally.

       127  Unexpected I/O error, internal errors, or other &quot;this can&apos;t  happen&quot;
            situations.

       If  an  uncompression  program returns an error exit status, this will be
       returned from xcfinfo too.
