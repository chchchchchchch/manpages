xcf2pnm(1)                                                            xcf2pnm(1)



NAME
       xcfview - display GIMP xcf files

SYNOPSIS
       xcfview [ options ] filename [ layer names ]

DESCRIPTION
       xcfview  is a wrapper script that uses xcf2png(1) or xcf2pnm(1) (q.v.) to
       flatten an XCF image and then displays the flattened image using a PNG or
       PPM viewer found using xdg-open(1) from the xdg-utils package.

OPTIONS
       Every  command-line  parameter  to  xcfview will be passed through to the
       underlying xcf2png or xcf2pnm command.  Because it is not  certain  which
       converter  will be used, the options given should be ones that make sense
       for both of these.

       --mask  Enable the layer mask.

       --mode mode
               Set the layer mode (e.g., Normal or Multiply).

       --nomask
               Disable the layer mask.

       --opacity n
               Set the opacity on a scale from 0 to 255 (as used internally)

       --percent n
               Set the opacity on a scale from 0 to 100 (as  in  the  Gimp  user
               interface).

       -A, --force-alpha
               Invent  a  trivial  alpha  channel even if the flattened image is
               completely opaque.

       -b color, --background color
               Use this color for transparent pixels in the  image.   The  color
               can  be given as #rrggbb or #rgb hexadecimal values, or as an X11
               color name (which will only work if a color name database can  be
               found in one of a number of standard locations).

       -c, --color, --colour
               Force the output to use RGB color space even if it there are more
               compact alternatives.

       -C, --autocrop
               Set the converted part of the image such that it just include the
               boundaries of the visible (or selected) layers.  This may make it
               either smaller or larger than the canvas, depending on the  posi&#8208;
               tion  and size of the visible layers.  (Note that the contents of
               the layers is not taken into account when autocropping).

               In the absence of options that specify otherwise,  the  converted
               image will cover the entire XCF canvas.

       -D, --dissolve
               Do  a  &quot;dissolve&quot;  step  to  eliminate partial transparency after
               flattening.  If -b is also given, this happens before  the  back&#8208;
               ground color is applied.

       -f, --full-image
               First  flatten the entire image to a memory buffer before writing
               output. Then analyse the image to decide on the  details  of  the
               output  format  (e.g., whether a grayscale output is sufficient).
               Without this option, the program flattens only  a  singe  row  of
               &quot;tiles&quot; (height 64) at a time.

       -g, --gray, --grey
               Force  the output to be a grayscale image even if it may be mono&#8208;
               chrome.  If any colored pixels are encountered, exit with  status
               103.   This  will  be selected automatically if the output file&apos;s
               name ends with .pgm.

       -G, --for-gif
               Assert that the flattened image will have no partial transparency
               (allowing  a  more  compact  representation of the alpha output).
               Exit with status 102 if  the  flattened  image  has  any  partial
               transparency.   If  -b  is  also  given, this tests whether there
               there is partial  transparency  before  applying  the  background
               color.

       -h, --help
               Print an option summery to standard output and exit with a return
               code of 0.

       -j, --bzip
               Equivalent to -Z bzcat.  Default if the filename ends with bz2.

       -o filename, --output filename
               Write the converted picture to filename instead  of  to  standard
               output.

       -O x,y, --offset x,y
               Offset  the  converted part of the image from the top-left corner
               of the XCF canvas. Usually used with -S.

       -S wxh, --size wxh
               Crop the converted image to width w and height h.

       -T, --truecolor
               Use standard  RGB  compositing  for  flattening  indexed  layers.
               Without this option, xcfview will mimic the Gimp&apos;s current strat&#8208;
               egy of rounding each alpha value to either full  transparency  or
               full opacity, and interpret all layer modes as Normal.

       -u, --utf8
               Use the raw UTF-8 representation from the XCF file to compare and
               display layer names.  Ordinarily, layer names will  be  converted
               to the character set of the current locale.

       -v, --verbose
               Print progress messages about the conversion to standard error.

       -V, --version
               Print  the  version numer of xcftools to standard output and exit
               with a return code of 0.

       -z, --gzip
               Equivalent to -Z zcat.  Default if the filename ends with gz.

       -Z command, --unpack command
               Specify a command that the input file is filtered through  before
               being  interpreted as an XCF file. The command is invoked as com&#8208;
               mand filename and must produce output  to  its  standard  output.
               Note that it is not possible to specify arguments as part of com&#8208;
               mand.  An uncompressor is selected automatically if the  filename
               ends  with  gz  or  bz2;  to  suppress this, use -Z cat (which is
               implemented without actually starting a cat(1) process).

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 in case of success. A nonzero exit status may either
       be that of the xcf2foo converter or that of the image viewer.
