XCLIP(1)                                                                XCLIP(1)



NAME
       xclip - command line interface to X selections (clipboard)

SYNOPSIS
       xclip [OPTION] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  from  standard  in,  or from one or more files, and makes the data
       available as an X selection for pasting into X applications. Prints  cur&#8208;
       rent X selection to standard out.

       -i, -in
              read text into X selection from standard input or files (default)

       -o, -out
              print  the  selection  to  standard out (generally for piping to a
              file or program)

       -f, -filter
              when xclip is invoked in the in mode  with  output  level  set  to
              silent (the defaults), the filter option will cause xclip to print
              the text piped to standard in back to standard out unmodified

       -l, -loops
              number of X selection requests (pastes  into  X  applications)  to
              wait for before exiting, with a value of 0 (default) causing xclip
              to wait for an unlimited number of requests until another applica&#8208;
              tion (possibly another invocation of xclip) takes ownership of the
              selection

       -t, -target
              specify a particular data format  using  the  given  target  atom.
              With  -o the special target atom name &quot;TARGETS&quot; can be used to get
              a list of valid target atoms for this selection.  For more  infor&#8208;
              mation about target atoms refer to ICCCM section 2.6.2

       -d, -display
              X display to use (e.g. &quot;localhost:0&quot;), xclip defaults to the value
              in $DISPLAY if this option is omitted

       -h, -help
              show quick summary of options

       -selection
              specify which X selection to use, options  are  &quot;primary&quot;  to  use
              XA_PRIMARY  (default), &quot;secondary&quot; for XA_SECONDARY or &quot;clipboard&quot;
              for XA_CLIPBOARD

       -version
              show version information

       -silent
              fork into the background to wait for  requests,  no  informational
              output, errors only (default)

       -quiet show  informational  messages on the terminal and run in the fore&#8208;
              ground

       -verbose
              provide a running commentary of what xclip is doing

       -noutf8
              operate in legacy (i.e. non UTF-8) mode for backwards  compatibil&#8208;
              ity (Use this option only when really necessary, as the old behav&#8208;
              ior was broken)


       xclip reads text from standard in or files  and  makes  it  available  to
       other  X  applications  for pasting as an X selection (traditionally with
       the middle mouse button). It reads from  all  files  specified,  or  from
       standard  in if no files are specified. xclip can also print the contents
       of a selection to standard out with the -o option.

       xclip was designed to allow tighter integration  of  X  applications  and
       command  line  programs.  The  default  action is to silently wait in the
       background for X selection requests (pastes) until another X  application
       places  data  in  the clipboard, at which point xclip exits silently. You
       can use the -verbose option to see if and when  xclip  actually  receives
       selection requests from other X applications.

       Options  can be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous. For exam&#8208;
       ple, it is possible to use -d or -disp instead of -display.  However,  -v
       couldn&apos;t  be used because it is ambiguous (it could be short for -verbose
       or -version), so it would be interpreted as a filename.

       Note that only the first character of the selection  specified  with  the
       -selection  option  is  important.  This means that &quot;p&quot;, &quot;sec&quot; and &quot;clip&quot;
       would have the same effect as using &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;clipboard&quot;
       respectively.


EXAMPLES
       I hate man pages without examples!

       uptime | xclip

       Put your uptime in the X selection. Then middle click in an X application
       to paste.

       xclip -loops 10 -verbose /etc/motd

       Exit after /etc/motd (message of the day) has been pasted 10 times.  Show
       how many selection requests (pastes) have been processed.

       xclip -o &gt; helloworld.c

       Put the contents of the selection into a file.

       xclip -t text/html index.html

       Middle click in an X application supporting HTML to paste the contents of
       the given file as HTML.


ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
              X display to use if none is specified with the -display option.
