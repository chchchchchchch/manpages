XCLIPBOARD(1)                                                      XCLIPBOARD(1)



NAME
       xclipboard - X clipboard client

SYNOPSIS
       xclipboard [ -toolkitoption ... ] [ -w ] [ -nw ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xclipboard  program  is  used to collect and display text selections
       that are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients.  It is typically used to
       save CLIPBOARD selections for later use.  It stores each CLIPBOARD selec&#8208;
       tion as a separate string, each of which  can  be  selected.   Each  time
       CLIPBOARD  is  asserted  by another application, xclipboard transfers the
       contents of that selection to a new buffer and displays it  in  the  text
       window.   Buffers  are never automatically deleted, so you&apos;ll want to use
       the delete button to get rid of useless items.

       Since xclipboard uses a Text Widget to display the contents of the  clip&#8208;
       board,  text  sent  to  the CLIPBOARD may be re-selected for use in other
       applications.  xclipboard also responds to  requests  for  the  CLIPBOARD
       selection  from  other clients by sending the entire contents of the cur&#8208;
       rently displayed buffer.

       An xclipboard window has the following buttons across the top:

       quit    When this button is pressed, xclipboard exits.

       delete  When this button is pressed, the current buffer  is  deleted  and
               the next one displayed.

       new     Creates  a new buffer with no contents.  Useful in constructing a
               new CLIPBOARD selection by hand.

       save    Displays a File Save dialog  box.   Pressing  the  Accept  button
               saves the currently displayed buffer to the file specified in the
               text field.

       next    Displays the next buffer in the list.

       previous
               Displays the previous buffer.

OPTIONS
       The xclipboard program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
       options as well as the following:

       -w      This  option indicates that lines of text that are too long to be
               displayed on one line in the clipboard should wrap around to  the
               following lines.

       -nw     This  option  indicates  that  long lines of text should not wrap
               around.  This is the default behavior.

WIDGETS
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of  the
       widgets  which  compose  xclipboard.   In the notation below, indentation
       indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given  first,
       followed by the widget instance name.

SENDING/RETRIEVING CLIPBOARD CONTENTS
       Text  is  copied  to the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of
       the CLIPBOARD selection.  Text is copied from the  clipboard  whenever  a
       client  requests  the  contents  of the CLIPBOARD selection.  Examples of
       event bindings that a user may wish to include in a  resource  configura&#8208;
       tion file to use the clipboard are:

       *VT100.Translations: #override \
            &lt;Btn3Up&gt;:                select-end(CLIPBOARD) \n\
            &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:                insert-selection(PRIMARY,CLIPBOARD) \n\
            &lt;Btn2Down&gt;:              ignore ()
