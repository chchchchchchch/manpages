XCONSOLE(1)                                                          XCONSOLE(1)



NAME
       xconsole - monitor system console messages with X

SYNOPSIS
       xconsole  [-toolkitoption  ...]  [-file  file-name] [-notify] [-stripNon&#8208;
       print] [-daemon] [-verbose] [-exitOnFail]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xconsole  program  displays  messages  which  are  usually  sent  to
       /dev/console.

OPTIONS
       Xconsole accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along
       with the additional options listed below:

       -file file-name
               To monitor some other device, use  this  option  to  specify  the
               device  name.   This  does  not work on regular files as they are
               always ready to be read from.

       -notify -nonotify
               When new data are received from the console and the notify option
               is  set,  the  icon name of the application has &quot; *&quot; appended, so
               that it is  evident  even  when  the  application  is  iconified.
               -notify is the default.

       -daemon This  option  causes  xconsole to place itself in the background,
               using fork/exit.

       -verbose
               When set, this option directs xconsole to display an  informative
               message in the first line of the text buffer.

       -exitOnFail
               When  set, this option directs xconsole to exit when it is unable
               to redirect the console output.

       -saveLines count
               When set, xconsole only preserves count lines of message  history
               instead of growing the text buffer without bound (a count of zero
               - the default - is treated as placing no limit on the history).

X DEFAULTS
       This program uses the Athena Text widget, look in the Athena  Widget  Set
       documentation for controlling it.

       Xconsole  otherwise  accepts  resources of the same names as the command-
       line options (without the leading dash).  &quot;file&quot; is a string type, &quot;save&#8208;
       Lines&quot; an integer, and the remaining options are booleans.

WIDGETS
       In  order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
       widgets which compose xconsole.  In the notation below, indentation indi&#8208;
       cates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, fol&#8208;
       lowed by the widget instance name.

               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/XConsole
