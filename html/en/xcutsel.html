XCUTSEL(1)                                                            XCUTSEL(1)



NAME
       xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and selection

SYNOPSIS
       xcutsel [ -toolkitoption ...] [-selection selection] [-cutbuffer number]

DESCRIPTION
       The xcutsel program is used to copy the current selection into a cut buf&#8208;
       fer and to make a selection that contains the current contents of the cut
       buffer.   It  acts  as  a  bridge between applications that don&apos;t support
       selections and those that do.

       By default, xcutsel will use the selection named PRIMARY and the cut buf&#8208;
       fer  CUT_BUFFER0.   Either  or both of these can be overridden by command
       line arguments or by resources.

       An xcutsel window has the following buttons:

           quit
               When this button is pressed, xcutsel exits.  Any selections  held
               by xcutsel are automatically released.

           copy PRIMARY to 0
               When this button is pressed, xcutsel copies the current selection
               into the cut buffer.

           copy 0 to PRIMARY
               When this button is pressed, xcutsel converts  the  current  con&#8208;
               tents of the cut buffer into the selection.

       The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by command
       line options or through the resource database.

       When the ``copy 0 to PRIMARY&apos;&apos;  button  is  activated,  the  button  will
       remain  inverted  as  long as xcutsel remains the owner of the selection.
       This serves to remind you which client owns the current selection.   Note
       that  the  value  of  the selection remains constant; if the cutbuffer is
       changed, you must again activate the copy  button  to  retrieve  the  new
       value when desired.

OPTIONS
       Xcutsel  accepts  all  of  the standard X Toolkit command line options as
       well as the following:

       -selection name
               This option specifies the name of  the  selection  to  use.   The
               default  is  PRIMARY.   The only supported abbreviations for this
               option are ``-select&apos;&apos;, ``-sel&apos;&apos;  and  ``-s&apos;&apos;,  as  the  standard
               toolkit option ``-selectionTimeout&apos;&apos; has a similar name.

       -cutbuffer number
               This  option specifies the cut buffer to use.  The default is cut
               buffer 0.

X DEFAULTS
       This program accepts all of the standard X  Toolkit  resource  names  and
       classes as well as:

       selection (class Selection)
               This  resource  specifies  the name of the selection to use.  The
               default is PRIMARY.
&#12;       cutBuffer (class CutBuffer)
               This resource specifies the number of the cut buffer to use.  The
               default is 0.

WIDGET NAMES
       The  following  instance names may be used when user configuration of the
       labels in them is desired:

       sel-cut (class Command)
               This is the ``copy SELECTION to BUFFER&apos;&apos; button.

       cut-sel (class Command)
               This is the ``copy BUFFER to SELECTION&apos;&apos; button.

       quit (class Command)
               This is the ``quit&apos;&apos; button.

       client documentation for how to make a selection.

BUGS
       There  is no way to change the name of the selection or the number of the
       cut buffer while the program is running.
