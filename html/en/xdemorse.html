NAME
       xdemorse - GTK+ Morse Code Decoding Software

SYNOPSIS
       xdemorse [ -v | -h | -l ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xdemorse command.

       xdemorse(1)  is a X/GTK+ application for decoding Morse code signals into
       text.

       xdemorse(1) detects the &quot;dihs&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; that make a Morse code  charac&#8208;
       ter  via  the  computer&apos;s  sound  card, which can be connected to a radio
       receiver tuned to a CW Morse code transmission or to  a  tone  generator.
       The input signal is processed by a Goertzel tone detector algorithm which
       produces &quot;mark&quot; or &quot;space&quot; (signal/no signal) outputs and  the  resulting
       stream  of  Morse  code &quot;elements&quot; is decoded into an ASCII character for
       printing to the Text viewer.

OPTIONS
       -h     print a short help message

       -v     print xdemorse(1) version

       -l     list mixer device names and exit
