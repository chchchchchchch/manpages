XDR(3)                      Linux Programmer&apos;s Manual                     XDR(3)



NAME
       xdr - library routines for external data representation

SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
       These  routines allow C programmers to describe arbitrary data structures
       in a machine-independent fashion.  Data for remote  procedure  calls  are
       transmitted using these routines.

       The prototypes below are declared in &lt;rpc/xdr.h&gt; and make use of the fol&#8208;
       lowing types:

           typedef int bool_t;

           typedef bool_t (*xdrproc_t) (XDR *, void *,...);

       For the declaration of the XDR type, see &lt;rpc/xdr.h&gt;.

       bool_t xdr_array(XDR *xdrs, char **arrp, unsigned int *sizep,
                        unsigned int maxsize, unsigned int elsize,
                        xdrproc_t elproc);

              A filter primitive that translates between variable-length  arrays
              and  their  corresponding  external representations.  The argument
              arrp is the address of the pointer to the array,  while  sizep  is
              the  address of the element count of the array; this element count
              cannot exceed maxsize.  The argument elsize is the sizeof each  of
              the  array&apos;s elements, and elproc is an XDR filter that translates
              between the array elements&apos; C form, and their external representa&#8208;
              tion.  This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_bool(XDR *xdrs, bool_t *bp);

              A  filter  primitive that translates between booleans (C integers)
              and their external representations.  When encoding data, this fil&#8208;
              ter  produces  values of either one or zero.  This routine returns
              one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_bytes(XDR *xdrs, char **sp, unsigned int *sizep,
                        unsigned int maxsize);

              A filter primitive that translates between  counted  byte  strings
              and  their  external  representations.   The  argument  sp  is the
              address of the string  pointer.   The  length  of  the  string  is
              located  at  address sizep; strings cannot be longer than maxsize.
              This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_char(XDR *xdrs, char *cp);

              A filter primitive that translates between C characters and  their
              external  representations.   This  routine  returns one if it suc&#8208;
              ceeds, zero otherwise.  Note: encoded characters are  not  packed,
              and  occupy  4 bytes each.  For arrays of characters, it is worth&#8208;
              while to consider xdr_bytes(), xdr_opaque() or xdr_string().

       void xdr_destroy(XDR *xdrs);

              A macro that invokes the destroy routine associated with  the  XDR
              stream,  xdrs.   Destruction usually involves freeing private data
              structures associated with the stream.  Using xdrs after  invoking
              xdr_destroy() is undefined.

       bool_t xdr_double(XDR *xdrs, double *dp);

              A filter primitive that translates between C double precision num&#8208;
              bers and their external representations.  This routine returns one
              if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_enum(XDR *xdrs, enum_t *ep);

              A filter primitive that translates between C enums (actually inte&#8208;
              gers) and their external representations.   This  routine  returns
              one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_float(XDR *xdrs, float *fp);

              A  filter  primitive  that  translates  between C floats and their
              external representations.  This routine returns  one  if  it  suc&#8208;
              ceeds, zero otherwise.

       void xdr_free(xdrproc_t proc, char *objp);

              Generic  freeing  routine.   The first argument is the XDR routine
              for the object being freed.  The second argument is a  pointer  to
              the  object  itself.   Note: the pointer passed to this routine is
              not freed, but what it points to is freed (recursively).

       unsigned int xdr_getpos(XDR *xdrs);

              A macro that invokes the get-position routine associated with  the
              XDR  stream, xdrs.  The routine returns an unsigned integer, which
              indicates the position of the XDR byte stream.  A  desirable  fea&#8208;
              ture of XDR streams is that simple arithmetic works with this num&#8208;
              ber, although the XDR stream instances need not guarantee this.

       long *xdr_inline(XDR *xdrs, int len);

              A macro that invokes the inline routine associated  with  the  XDR
              stream, xdrs.  The routine returns a pointer to a contiguous piece
              of the stream&apos;s buffer; len is the byte length of the desired buf&#8208;
              fer.  Note: pointer is cast to long *.

              Warning:  xdr_inline() may return NULL (0) if it cannot allocate a
              contiguous piece of a buffer.  Therefore  the  behavior  may  vary
              among stream instances; it exists for the sake of efficiency.

       bool_t xdr_int(XDR *xdrs, int *ip);

              A  filter  primitive  that translates between C integers and their
              external representations.  This routine returns  one  if  it  suc&#8208;
              ceeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_long(XDR *xdrs, long *lp);

              A  filter  primitive  that  translates between C long integers and
              their external representations.  This routine returns  one  if  it
              succeeds, zero otherwise.

       void xdrmem_create(XDR *xdrs, char *addr, unsigned int size,
                          enum xdr_op op);

              This routine initializes the XDR stream object pointed to by xdrs.
              The stream&apos;s data is written to, or read from, a chunk  of  memory
              at  location  addr  whose  length is no more than size bytes long.
              The  op  determines  the  direction  of  the  XDR  stream  (either
              XDR_ENCODE, XDR_DECODE, or XDR_FREE).

       bool_t xdr_opaque(XDR *xdrs, char *cp, unsigned int cnt);
&#12;              A  filter primitive that translates between fixed size opaque data
              and its external representation.  The argument cp is  the  address
              of  the opaque object, and cnt is its size in bytes.  This routine
              returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_pointer(XDR *xdrs, char **objpp,
                          unsigned int objsize, xdrproc_t xdrobj);

              Like xdr_reference() except  that  it  serializes  NULL  pointers,
              whereas  xdr_reference() does not.  Thus, xdr_pointer() can repre&#8208;
              sent recursive data structures, such as  binary  trees  or  linked
              lists.

       void xdrrec_create(XDR *xdrs, unsigned int sendsize,
                          unsigned int recvsize, char *handle,
                          int (*readit) (char *, char *, int),
                          int (*writeit) (char *, char *, int));

              This routine initializes the XDR stream object pointed to by xdrs.
              The stream&apos;s data is written to a buffer of size sendsize; a value
              of  zero  indicates the system should use a suitable default.  The
              stream&apos;s data is read from a buffer of size recvsize; it  too  can
              be  set  to  a  suitable  default by passing a zero value.  When a
              stream&apos;s output buffer is full,  writeit  is  called.   Similarly,
              when  a  stream&apos;s  input  buffer  is empty, readit is called.  The
              behavior of these two routines is  similar  to  the  system  calls
              read(2)  and  write(2), except that handle is passed to the former
              routines as the first argument.  Note: the XDR stream&apos;s  op  field
              must be set by the caller.

              Warning: this XDR stream implements an intermediate record stream.
              Therefore there are additional bytes  in  the  stream  to  provide
              record boundary information.

       bool_t xdrrec_endofrecord(XDR *xdrs, int sendnow);

              This routine can be invoked only on streams created by xdrrec_cre&#8208;
              ate().  The data in the output buffer is  marked  as  a  completed
              record, and the output buffer is optionally written out if sendnow
              is nonzero.  This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero  other&#8208;
              wise.

       bool_t xdrrec_eof(XDR *xdrs);

              This routine can be invoked only on streams created by xdrrec_cre&#8208;
              ate().  After consuming the rest of  the  current  record  in  the
              stream,  this routine returns one if the stream has no more input,
              zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdrrec_skiprecord(XDR *xdrs);

              This routine can be invoked only on streams created by xdrrec_cre&#8208;
              ate().   It tells the XDR implementation that the rest of the cur&#8208;
              rent record in the stream&apos;s  input  buffer  should  be  discarded.
              This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_reference(XDR *xdrs, char **pp, unsigned int size,
                            xdrproc_t proc);

              A  primitive that provides pointer chasing within structures.  The
              argument pp is the address of the pointer; size is the sizeof  the
              structure  that  *pp  points to; and proc is an XDR procedure that
              filters the structure between its C form and its  external  repre&#8208;
              sentation.   This  routine returns one if it succeeds, zero other&#8208;
              wise.
&#12;              Warning: this routine does  not  understand  NULL  pointers.   Use
              xdr_pointer() instead.

       xdr_setpos(XDR *xdrs, unsigned int pos);

              A  macro that invokes the set position routine associated with the
              XDR stream xdrs.  The argument pos is a  position  value  obtained
              from  xdr_getpos().   This  routine  returns one if the XDR stream
              could be repositioned, and zero otherwise.

              Warning: it is difficult to reposition some types of XDR  streams,
              so  this routine may fail with one type of stream and succeed with
              another.

       bool_t xdr_short(XDR *xdrs, short *sp);

              A filter primitive that translates between C  short  integers  and
              their  external  representations.   This routine returns one if it
              succeeds, zero otherwise.

       void xdrstdio_create(XDR *xdrs, FILE *file, enum xdr_op op);

              This routine initializes the XDR stream object pointed to by xdrs.
              The  XDR stream data is written to, or read from, the stdio stream
              file.  The argument op determines the direction of the XDR  stream
              (either XDR_ENCODE, XDR_DECODE, or XDR_FREE).

              Warning:  the  destroy  routine  associated  with such XDR streams
              calls fflush(3) on the file stream, but never fclose(3).

       bool_t xdr_string(XDR *xdrs, char **sp, unsigned int maxsize);

              A filter primitive that translates between  C  strings  and  their
              corresponding  external representations.  Strings cannot be longer
              than maxsize.  Note: sp is the address of  the  string&apos;s  pointer.
              This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_u_char(XDR *xdrs, unsigned char *ucp);

              A  filter  primitive that translates between unsigned C characters
              and their external representations.  This routine returns  one  if
              it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_u_int(XDR *xdrs, unsigned *up);

              A filter primitive that translates between C unsigned integers and
              their external representations.  This routine returns  one  if  it
              succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_u_long(XDR *xdrs, unsigned long *ulp);

              A  filter  primitive that translates between C unsigned long inte&#8208;
              gers and their external representations.  This routine returns one
              if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_u_short(XDR *xdrs, unsigned short *usp);

              A  filter primitive that translates between C unsigned short inte&#8208;
              gers and their external representations.  This routine returns one
              if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_union(XDR *xdrs, int *dscmp, char *unp,
                        struct xdr_discrim *choices,
                        xdrproc_t defaultarm);     /* may equal NULL */

              A filter primitive that translates between a discriminated C union
              and its corresponding external representation.   It  first  trans&#8208;
              lates  the  discriminant of the union located at dscmp.  This dis&#8208;
              criminant is always an enum_t.  Next the union located at  unp  is
              translated.   The  argument  choices  is  a pointer to an array of
              xdr_discrim() structures.  Each structure contains an ordered pair
              of  [value,proc].   If  the  union&apos;s  discriminant is equal to the
              associated value, then the proc is called to translate the  union.
              The  end of the xdr_discrim() structure array is denoted by a rou&#8208;
              tine of value NULL.  If the  discriminant  is  not  found  in  the
              choices  array,  then the defaultarm procedure is called (if it is
              not NULL).  Returns one if it succeeds, zero otherwise.

       bool_t xdr_vector(XDR *xdrs, char *arrp, unsigned int size,
                         unsigned int elsize, xdrproc_t elproc);

              A filter primitive that translates between fixed-length arrays and
              their  corresponding  external representations.  The argument arrp
              is the address of the pointer to the array, while size is the ele&#8208;
              ment  count  of the array.  The argument elsize is the sizeof each
              of the array&apos;s elements, and elproc is an XDR filter  that  trans&#8208;
              lates  between the array elements&apos; C form, and their external rep&#8208;
              resentation.  This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero other&#8208;
              wise.

       bool_t xdr_void(void);

              This routine always returns one.  It may be passed to RPC routines
              that require a function argument, where nothing is to be done.

       bool_t xdr_wrapstring(XDR *xdrs, char **sp);

              A primitive that calls xdr_string(xdrs, sp,MAXUN.UNSIGNED ); where
              MAXUN.UNSIGNED  is  the  maximum  value  of  an  unsigned integer.
              xdr_wrapstring() is handy because the RPC package passes a maximum
              of  two  XDR  routines  as arguments, and xdr_string(), one of the
              most frequently used primitives, requires three.  Returns  one  if
              it succeeds, zero otherwise.
