XEV(1)                                                                    XEV(1)



NAME
       xev - print contents of X events

SYNOPSIS
       xev  [-display  displayname]  [-geometry geom] [-bw pixels] [-bs {NotUse&#8208;
       ful,WhenMapped,Always}] [-id windowid] [-root] [-s] [-name string] [-rv]

DESCRIPTION
       Xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it  events  when&#8208;
       ever  anything  happens  to  the window (such as it being moved, resized,
       typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an existing  win&#8208;
       dow.   It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to display
       the information that they contain; it  is  essentially  a  debugging  and
       development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.

OPTIONS
       -display display
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -geometry geom
               This  option specifies the size and/or location of the window, if
               a window is to be created.

       -bw pixels
               This option specifies the border width for the window.

       -bs {NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}
               This option specifies what kind of backing store to give the win&#8208;
               dow.   The  default is NotUseful. Backing store refers to the the
               pixels saved off-screen when the X server maintains the  contents
               of a window; NotUseful means that the xev process will redraw its
               contents itself, as necessary.

       -id windowid
               This option specifies that the window with the given id should be
               monitored, instead of creating a new window.

       -root   This  option  specifies that the root window should be monitored,
               instead of creating a new window.

       -s      This option specifies that save-unders should be enabled  on  the
               window.  Save unders are similar to backing store, but they refer
               rather to the saving of pixels off-screen when the current window
               obscures  other  windows.  Save unders are only advisory, and are
               normally set for popup dialogs and other transient windows.

       -name string
               This option specifies the name to assign to the created window.

       -rv     This option specifies that the window should be in reverse video.
