NAME
       xfce4-popup-windowlist - shows the Xfce window list applet popup


SYNOPSIS
       xfce4-popup-windowlist [ -pointer ]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xfce4-popup-windowlist command.

       xfce4-popup-windowlist  shows  the  Xfce window list if at least one Xfce
       window list applet is present on one of your panel(s).

       The default behaviour is to show the window list near the applet  button.
       If you have several Xfce window list applets, only the first one you have
       set up will pop up.

       If you want to pop up the window  list  without  using  the  window  list
       applet on your panel(s), see the manual page for xfdesktop(1).


OPTIONS
       -pointer
              The  window list appears at your current mouse position instead of
              its default position.


SEE ALSO
       xfce4-popup-menu(1), xfdesktop(1)
