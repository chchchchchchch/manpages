SYNOPSIS
       xfce4-power-manager-settings [options]


DESCRIPTION
       xfce4-power-manager-settings is a utility that comes with the Xfce4 power
       manager  to  access/change  its  configuration.  It is a separate program
       that uses xfconf to load/save settings according to the  user&apos;s  choices.
       xfce4-power-manager-settings  requires the Xfce4 power manager to be run&#8208;
       ning because it connects to it via DBus and gets information about  which
       settings   should  and  should  not  be  displayed;  for   example,   the
       xfce4-power-manager-settings utility will not  show  the  LCD  brightness
       settings  if  no device was detected by the running instance of the Xfce4
       power manager.
        xfce4-power-manager-settings does not have any command line options.
