XFCE4-POWER-MANAGER(1)                                    XFCE4-POWER-MANAGER(1)



NAME
       xfce4-power-manager - The Xfce 4 Power manager


SYNOPSIS
       xfce4-power-manager [options]


DESCRIPTION
       xfce4-power-manager  manages  the  power  sources on the computer and the
       devices that can be controlled to reduce their power consumption (such as
       LCD brightness level, monitor sleep, CPU frequency scaling). In addition,
       xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant  DBus  inter&#8208;
       faces to inform other applications about current power level so that they
       can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit interface
       which  allows  applications  to  prevent  automatic sleep actions via the
       power manager; as an example,  the  operating  system&apos;s  package  manager
       should  make  use  of this interface while it is performing update opera&#8208;
       tions.
       You can run xfce4-power-manager from the command line without  specifying
       any extra arguments.

       --no-daemon
              Starts the power manager in non-daemon mode: useful for debugging.

       --restart
              Causes the running power manager to restart.

       --customize
