xfs_admin(8)                                                        xfs_admin(8)



NAME
       xfs_admin - change parameters of an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_admin [ -eflpu ] [ -c 0|1 ] [ -L label ] [ -U uuid ] device

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_admin  uses  the  xfs_db(8) command to modify various parameters of a
       filesystem.

       Devices that are mounted cannot be modified.  Administrators must unmount
       filesystems before xfs_admin or xfs_db(8) can convert parameters.  A num&#8208;
       ber of parameters of a mounted filesystem can be  examined  and  modified
       using the xfs_growfs(8) command.

OPTIONS
       -e     Enables  unwritten  extent  support  on a filesystem that does not
              already have this enabled (for legacy  filesystems,  it  can&apos;t  be
              disabled anymore at mkfs time).

       -f     Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is stored in a
              regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs -d file option).

       -j     Enables version 2 log format (journal format supporting larger log
              buffers).

       -l     Print the current filesystem label.

       -p     Enable 32bit project identifier support (PROJID32BIT feature).

       -u     Print the current filesystem UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier).

       -c 0|1 Enable  (1)  or disable (0) lazy-counters in the filesystem.  This
              operation may take quite a bit of time on large filesystems as the
              entire filesystem needs to be scanned when this option is changed.

              With  lazy-counters  enabled,  the  superblock  is not modified or
              logged on every change  of  the  free-space  and  inode  counters.
              Instead, enough information is kept in other parts of the filesys&#8208;
              tem to be able to maintain the counter values without  needing  to
              keep  them  in the superblock. This gives significant improvements
              in performance on some configurations and metadata intensive work&#8208;
              loads.

       -L label
              Set  the  filesystem label to label.  XFS filesystem labels can be
              at most 12 characters long; if label is longer than 12 characters,
              xfs_admin  will  truncate  it  and  print  a warning message.  The
              filesystem label can be cleared using the special &quot;--&quot;  value  for
              label.

       -U uuid
              Set  the UUID of the filesystem to uuid.  A sample UUID looks like
              this: &quot;c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16&quot;.  The uuid  may  also
              be  nil, which will set the filesystem UUID to the null UUID.  The
              uuid may also be generate, which will generate a new UUID for  the
              filesystem.

       The  mount(8)  manual entry describes how to mount a filesystem using its
       label or UUID, rather than its block special device name.
