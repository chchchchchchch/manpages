xfs_bmap(8)                                                          xfs_bmap(8)



NAME
       xfs_bmap - print block mapping for an XFS file

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_bmap [ -adlpv ] [ -n num_extents ] file

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_bmap  prints  the map of disk blocks used by files in an XFS filesys&#8208;
       tem.  The map lists each extent used by the file, as well as  regions  in
       the file that do not have any corresponding blocks (holes).  Each line of
       the listings takes the following form:

              extent: [startoffset..endoffset]: startblock..endblock

       Holes are marked by replacing the startblock..endblock  with  hole.   All
       the file offsets and disk blocks are in units of 512-byte blocks, no mat&#8208;
       ter what the filesystem&apos;s block size is.

OPTIONS
       -a     If  this  option  is  specified,  information  about  the   file&apos;s
              attribute fork is printed instead of the default data fork.

       -d     If  portions  of  the  file  have been migrated offline by a DMAPI
              application, a DMAPI read event will be generated to  bring  those
              portions  back  online before the disk block map is printed.  How&#8208;
              ever if the -d option is used, no DMAPI read event will be  gener&#8208;
              ated  for  a  DMAPI  file and offline portions will be reported as
              holes.

       -l     If this option is used, then

                   &lt;nblocks&gt;  blocks

              will be appended to each line.   nblocks  is  the  length  of  the
              extent described on the line in units of 512-byte blocks.

              This flag has no effect if the -v option is used.

       -n num_extents
              If  this  option is given, xfs_bmap obtains the extent list of the
              file in groups of num_extents  extents.  In  the  absence  of  -n,
              xfs_bmap  queries the system for the number of extents in the file
              and uses that value to compute the group size.

       -p     If this option is used, xfs_bmap obtains all  unwritten  (preallo&#8208;
              cated)  extents  that  do  not  contain  written data. With the -v
              option, the flags column will  show  which  extents  are  preallo&#8208;
              cated/unwritten.

       -v     Shows verbose information. When this flag is specified, additional
              AG specific information is appended to each line in the  following
              form:

                   agno (startagoffset..endagoffset) nblocks flags

              A second -v option will print out the flags legend.
