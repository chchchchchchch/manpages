xfs_io(8)                                                              xfs_io(8)



NAME
       xfs_io - debug the I/O path of an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_io [ -adFfmrRstx ] [ -c cmd ] ... [ -p prog ] file

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_io  is a debugging tool like xfs_db(8), but is aimed at examining the
       regular file I/O paths rather than the raw XFS volume itself.  These code
       paths include not only the obvious read/write/mmap interfaces for manipu&#8208;
       lating files, but also cover all of the XFS  extensions  (such  as  space
       preallocation, additional inode flags, etc).

OPTIONS
       -c cmd    xfs_io  commands  may  be run interactively (the default) or as
                 arguments on the command line. Multiple  -c  arguments  may  be
                 given.  The  commands  are  run in the sequence given, then the
                 program exits.

       -p prog   Set the program name for prompts and some error  messages,  the
                 default value is xfs_io.

       -F        Allow  file  to  reside in non-XFS (foreign) filesystems.  This
                 mode has a restricted set of commands.

       -f        Create file if it does not already exist.

       -r        Open file read-only, initially. This is  required  if  file  is
                 immutable or append-only.

       -x        Expert  mode.  Dangerous  commands  are  only available in this
                 mode.  These commands also tend to  require  additional  privi&#8208;
                 leges.

       The  other  open(2)  options  described below are also available from the
       command line.

CONCEPTS
       xfs_io maintains a number of open files and memory mappings.   Files  can
       be  initially  opened  on  the  command line (optionally), and additional
       files can also be opened later.

       xfs_io commands can be broken up into three groups.   Some  commands  are
       aimed at doing regular file I/O - read, write, sync, space preallocation,
       etc.

       The second set of commands exist for manipulating memory  mapped  regions
       of a file - mapping, accessing, storing, unmapping, flushing, etc.

       The  remaining commands are for the navigation and display of data struc&#8208;
       tures relating to the open files, mappings,  and  the  filesystems  where
       they reside.

       Many  commands  have extensive online help. Use the help command for more
       details on any command.

FILE I/O COMMANDS
       file [ N ]
              Display a list of all open files and  (optionally)  switch  to  an
              alternate current open file.

       open [[ -FacdfrstR ] path ]
              Closes  the  current  file,  and  opens the file specified by path
              instead. Without any arguments, displays statistics about the cur&#8208;
              rent file - see the stat command.
                 -F  allows non-XFS (foreign) files to be opened and operated on
                     with a restricted command set.
                 -a  opens append-only (O_APPEND).
                 -d  opens for direct I/O (O_DIRECT).
                 -f  creates the file if it doesn&apos;t already exist (O_CREAT).
                 -r  opens read-only (O_RDONLY).
                 -s  opens for synchronous I/O (O_SYNC).
                 -t  truncates on open (O_TRUNC).
                 -R  marks the file as a realtime XFS file after opening it,  if
                     it is not already marked as such.

       o      See the open command.

       close  Closes  the  current open file, marking the next open file as cur&#8208;
              rent (if one exists).

       c      See the close command.

       pread [ -b bsize ] [ -v ] offset length
              Reads a range of bytes in a specified  blocksize  from  the  given
              offset.
                 -b  can  be  used  to  set the blocksize into which the read(2)
                     requests will be  split.  The  default  blocksize  is  4096
                     bytes.
                 -v  dump  the  contents of the buffer after reading, by default
                     only the count of bytes actually read is dumped.

       r      See the pread command.

       pwrite [ -i file ] [ -d ] [ -s skip ] [ -b size ]  [  -S  seed  ]  offset
       length
              Writes  a  range  of bytes in a specified blocksize from the given
              offset.  The bytes written can be either a set pattern or read  in
              from another file before writing.
                 -i  allows  an  input file to be specified as the source of the
                     data to be written.
                 -d  causes direct I/O, rather than the usual buffered  I/O,  to
                     be used when reading the input file.
                 -s  specifies the number of bytes to skip from the start of the
                     input file before starting to read.
                 -b  used to set the blocksize into which the write(2)  requests
                     will be split. The default blocksize is 4096 bytes.
                 -S  used  to set the (repeated) fill pattern which is used when
                     the data to write is not coming from a file.   The  default
                     buffer fill pattern value is 0xcdcdcdcd.

       w      See the pwrite command.

       bmap [ -adlpv ] [ -n nx ]
              Prints  the  block mapping for the current open file. Refer to the
              xfs_bmap(8) manual page for complete documentation.

       extsize [ -R | -D ] [ value ]
              Display and/or modify the preferred extent size used when allocat&#8208;
              ing  space for the currently open file. If the -R option is speci&#8208;
              fied, a recursive descent is performed for all  directory  entries
              below the currently open file (-D can be used to restrict the out&#8208;
              put to directories only).  If the target file is a directory, then
              the  inherited  extent  size  is set for that directory (new files
              created in that directory inherit that extent  size).   The  value
              should be specified in bytes, or using one of the usual units suf&#8208;
              fixes (k, m, g, b, etc). The extent size  is  always  reported  in
              units of bytes.

       allocsp size 0
              Sets  the size of the file to size and zeroes any additional space
              allocated using  the  XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP/XFS_IOC_FREESP  system  call
              described  in  the  xfsctl(3)  manual page.  allocsp and freesp do
              exactly the same thing.

       freesp size 0
              See the allocsp command.

       fadvise [ -r | -s | [[ -d | -n | -w ] offset length ]]
              On platforms which support it, allows hints be given to the system
              regarding  the expected I/O patterns on the file.  The range argu&#8208;
              ments are required by some advise commands ([*]  below),  and  the
              others  must  have  no  range  arguments.   With no arguments, the
              POSIX_FADV_NORMAL advice is implied (default readahead).
                 -d  the data will not be accessed  again  in  the  near  future
                     (POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED[*]).
                 -n  data   will   be   accessed   once   and   not   be  reused
                     (POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE[*]).
                 -r  expect access to data in random order  (POSIX_FADV_RANDOM),
                     which sets readahead to zero.
                 -s  expect    access    to    data    in    sequential    order
                     (POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL), which doubles the  default  reada&#8208;
                     head on the file.
                 -w  advises   the   specified   data   will   be  needed  again
                     (POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED[*]) which forces  the  maximum  reada&#8208;
                     head.

       fdatasync
              Calls fdatasync(2) to flush the file&apos;s in-core data to disk.

       fsync  Calls fsync(2) to flush all in-core file state to disk.

       s      See the fsync command.

       resvsp offset length
              Allocates  reserved,  unwritten space for part of a file using the
              XFS_IOC_RESVSP system call described in the xfsctl(3) manual page.

       unresvsp offset length
              Frees reserved space for part of a file using the XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP
              system call described in the xfsctl(3) manual page.

       falloc [ -k ] offset length
              Allocates  reserved,  unwritten space for part of a file using the
              fallocate routine as described in the fallocate(3) manual page.
                 -k  will set the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag as described in  fal&#8208;
                     locate(3).

       truncate offset
              Truncates the current file at the given offset using ftruncate(2).

       sendfile -i srcfile | -f N [ offset length ]
              On  platforms  which  support  it,  allows a direct in-kernel copy
              between two file descriptors. The current open file is the target,
              the  source must be specified as another open file (-f) or by path
              (-i).


MEMORY MAPPED I/O COMMANDS
       mmap [ N | [[ -rwx ] offset length ]]
              With no arguments, mmap shows the current mappings.  Specifying  a
              single  numeric  argument N sets the current mapping. If two argu&#8208;
              ments are specified (a range specified by offset  and  length),  a
              new mapping is created spanning the range, and the protection mode
              can be given as a combination of PROT_READ (-r), PROT_WRITE  (-w),
              and PROT_EXEC (-x).

       mm     See the mmap command.

       munmap Unmaps the current memory mapping.
&#12;       mu     See the munmap command.

       mread [ -f | -v ] [ -r ] [ offset length ]
              Accesses a segment of the current memory mapping, optionally dump&#8208;
              ing it to the standard output stream (with -v or  -f  option)  for
              inspection. The accesses are performed sequentially from the start
              offset by default, but can also be done  from  the  end  backwards
              through  the  mapping if the -r option in specified.  The two ver&#8208;
              bose modes differ only in the relative offsets they  display,  the
              -f option is relative to file start, whereas -v shows offsets rel&#8208;
              ative to the start of the mapping.

       mr     See the mread command.

       mwrite [ -r ] [ -S seed ] [ offset length ]
              Stores a byte into memory for  a  range  within  a  mapping.   The
              default stored value is &apos;X&apos;, repeated to fill the range specified,
              but this can be changed using the -S option.   The  memory  stores
              are  performed  sequentially from the start offset by default, but
              can also be done from the end backwards through the mapping if the
              -r option in specified.

       mw     See the mwrite command.

       msync [ -i ] [ -a | -s ] [ offset length ]
              Writes  all  modified copies of pages over the specified range (or
              entire mapping if no range specified)  to  their  backing  storage
              locations.   Also,  optionally invalidates (-i) so that subsequent
              references to the pages will be obtained from their backing  stor&#8208;
              age  locations  (instead of cached copies).  The flush can be done
              synchronously (-s) or asynchronously (-a).

       ms     See the msync command.

       madvise [ -d | -r | -s | -w ] [ offset length ]
              Modifies page cache behavior when operating on  the  current  map&#8208;
              ping.   The  range  arguments are required by some advise commands
              ([*] below).  With no arguments, the POSIX_MADV_NORMAL  advice  is
              implied (default readahead).
                 -d  the pages will not be needed (POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED[*]).
                 -r  expect  random  page  references (POSIX_MADV_RANDOM), which
                     sets readahead to zero.
                 -s  expect sequential page references  (POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL),
                     which doubles the default readahead on the file.
                 -w  advises   the   specified   pages   will  be  needed  again
                     (POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED[*]) which forces  the  maximum  reada&#8208;
                     head.

       mincore
              Dumps  a  list  of  pages or ranges of pages that are currently in
              core, for the current memory mapping.


OTHER COMMANDS
       print  Display a list of all open files and memory mapped  regions.   The
              current file and current mapping are distinguishable from any oth&#8208;
              ers.

       p      See the print command.

       quit   Exit xfs_io.

       q      See the quit command.

       lsattr [ -R | -D | -a | -v ]
              List extended inode flags on the currently open file.  If  the  -R
              option  is  specified,  a  recursive  descent is performed for all
              directory entries below the currently open file (-D can be used to
              restrict  the  output to directories only).  This is a depth first
              descent, it does not follow symlinks and it also  does  not  cross
              mount points.

       chattr [ -R | -D ] [ +/-riasAdtPneEfS ]
              Change extended inode flags on the currently open file. The -R and
              -D options have the same meaning as  above.  The  mapping  between
              each  letter  and the inode flags (refer to xfsctl(3) for the full
              list) is available via the help command.

       freeze Suspend all write I/O requests to the filesystem  of  the  current
              file.  Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.

       thaw   Undo the effects of a filesystem freeze operation.  Only available
              in expert mode and requires privileges.

       inject [ tag ]
              Inject errors into a filesystem to observe filesystem behavior  at
              specific  points  under  adverse conditions. Without the tag argu&#8208;
              ment, displays the list of error tags available.   Only  available
              in expert mode and requires privileges.

       resblks [ blocks ]
              Get  and/or  set  count  of  reserved  filesystem blocks using the
              XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS or XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS system calls.  Note  --
              this  can  be  useful  for exercising out of space behavior.  Only
              available in expert mode and requires privileges.

       shutdown [ -f ]
              Force the filesystem to shutdown (with  or  without  flushing  the
              log).  Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.

       stat [ -v ]
              Selected  statistics  from stat(2) and the XFS_IOC_GETXATTR system
              call on the current file. If the -v option is specified, the atime
              (last  access), mtime (last modify), and ctime (last change) time&#8208;
              stamps are also displayed.

       statfs Selected statistics from statfs(2) and the XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY sys&#8208;
              tem call on the filesystem where the current file resides.

       parent [ -cpv ]
              By default this command prints out the parent inode numbers, inode
              generation numbers and basenames of all the hardlinks which  point
              to the inode of the current file.
                 -p  the  output  is  similar to the default output except path&#8208;
                     names up to the mount-point are printed out instead of  the
                     component name.
                 -c  the  file&apos;s filesystem will check all the parent attributes
                     for consistency.
                 -v  verbose output will be printed.
              [NOTE: Not currently operational on Linux.]
