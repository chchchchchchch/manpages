xfs_metadump(8)                                                  xfs_metadump(8)



NAME
       xfs_metadump - copy XFS filesystem metadata to a file

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_metadump [ -efgow ] [ -l logdev ] source target

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_metadump  is  a  debugging  tool that copies the metadata from an XFS
       filesystem to a file.  The source argument must be the  pathname  of  the
       device  or  file  containing  the  XFS filesystem and the target argument
       specifies the destination file name.  If target is -, then the output  is
       sent  to  stdout. This allows the output to be redirected to another pro&#8208;
       gram such as a compression application.

       xfs_metadump should only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, read-only
       mounted  filesystems,  or frozen filesystems (see xfs_freeze(8)).  Other&#8208;
       wise, the generated dump could be inconsistent or corrupt.

       xfs_metadump does not alter the source filesystem in any way. The  target
       image  is  a contiguous (non-sparse) file containing all the filesystem&apos;s
       metadata and indexes to where the blocks were copied from.

       By default, xfs_metadump obfuscates most file  (regular  file,  directory
       and  symbolic link) names and extended attribute names to allow the dumps
       to be sent without revealing confidential information. Extended attribute
       values  are zeroed and no data is copied. The only exceptions are file or
       attribute names that are 4 or less characters in length. Also file  names
       that span extents (this can only occur with the mkfs.xfs(8) options where
       -n size &gt; -b size) are not obfuscated. Names between 5 and  8  characters
       in length inclusively are partially obfuscated.

       xfs_metadump should not be used for any purposes other than for debugging
       and reporting filesystem problems. The most  common  usage  scenario  for
       this tool is when xfs_repair(8) fails to repair a filesystem and a metad&#8208;
       ump image can be sent for analysis.

       The file generated by xfs_metadump can be restored  to  filesystem  image
       (minus the data) using the xfs_mdrestore(8) tool.

OPTIONS
       -e     Stops  the  dump  on  a  read error. Normally, it will ignore read
              errors and copy all the metadata that is accessible.

       -f     Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is stored in a
              regular file (see the mkfs.xfs -d file option). This can also hap&#8208;
              pen if an image copy of a filesystem has been made into  an  ordi&#8208;
              nary file with xfs_copy(8).

       -g     Shows  dump  progress.  This  is sent to stdout if the target is a
              file or to stderr if the target is stdout.

       -l logdev
              For filesystems which use an  external  log,  this  specifies  the
              device  where  the  external  log resides. The external log is not
              copied, only internal logs are copied.

       -o     Disables obfuscation of file names and extended attributes.

       -w     Prints warnings of inconsistent metadata  encountered  to  stderr.
              Bad metadata is still copied.

DIAGNOSTICS
       xfs_metadump  returns  an exit code of 0 if all readable metadata is suc&#8208;
       cessfully copied or 1 if a write error occurs or a read error occurs  and
       the -e option used.

NOTES
       As  xfs_metadump  copies  metadata only, it does not matter if the source
       filesystem has a realtime section or not. If the filesystem has an exter&#8208;
       nal  log,  it is not copied. Internal logs are copied and any outstanding
       log transactions are not obfuscated if they contain names.

       xfs_metadump is a shell wrapper around the xfs_db(8) metadump command.
