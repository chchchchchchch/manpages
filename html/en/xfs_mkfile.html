NAME
       xfs_mkfile - create an XFS file

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_mkfile [ -v ] [ -n ] size[k|b|m|g] filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_mkfile  creates  one or more files. The file is padded with zeroes by
       default.  The default size is in bytes, but it can be  flagged  as  kilo&#8208;
       bytes,  blocks,  megabytes, or gigabytes with the k, b, m, or g suffixes,
       respectively.

OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose. Report the names and sizes of created files.

       -n     No bytes. Create a holey file - that is,  do  not  write  out  any
              data, just seek to end of file and write a block.



                                                                   xfs_mkfile(8)
