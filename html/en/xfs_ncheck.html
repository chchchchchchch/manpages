xfs_ncheck(8)                                                      xfs_ncheck(8)



NAME
       xfs_ncheck - generate pathnames from i-numbers for XFS

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_ncheck [ -i ino ] ... [ -f ] [ -s ] [ -l logdev ] device

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_ncheck  with  no  -i arguments generates an inode number and pathname
       list of all files on the given filesystem. Names of directory  files  are
       followed  by  /..  The output is not sorted in any particular order.  The
       filesystem to be examined is specified  by  the  device  argument,  which
       should  be  the  disk  or  volume device for the filesystem.  Filesystems
       stored in files can also be checked, using the -f flag.

OPTIONS
       -f       Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed is stored in
                a regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs -d file option). This
                might happen if an image copy of a filesystem has been made into
                an ordinary file.

       -l logdev
                Specifies   the  device  where  the  filesystem&apos;s  external  log
                resides.  Only for those filesystems which use an external  log.
                See  the  mkfs.xfs -l option, and refer to xfs(5) for a detailed
                description of the XFS log.

       -s       Limits the report to special  files  and  files  with  setuserid
                mode.   This option may be used to detect violations of security
                policy.

       -i ino   Limits the report to only those files whose inode  numbers  fol&#8208;
                low.   May be given multiple times to select multiple inode num&#8208;
                bers.

       If the filesystem is seriously corrupted, or very busy and looks like  it
       is corrupt, a message of the form that would be generated by xfs_check(8)
       may appear.

       xfs_ncheck is only useful with XFS filesystems.
