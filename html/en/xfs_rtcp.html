NAME
       xfs_rtcp - XFS realtime copy command

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_rtcp [ -e extsize ] [ -p ] source ... target

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_rtcp  copies  a  file to the realtime partition on an XFS filesystem.
       If there is more than one source and target, the final argument (the tar&#8208;
       get) must be a directory which already exists.

OPTIONS
       -e extsize
              Sets the extent size of the destination realtime file.

       -p     Use  if the size of the source file is not an even multiple of the
              block size of the destination filesystem.  When  -p  is  specified
              xfs_rtcp  will pad the destination file to a size which is an even
              multiple of the filesystem block size.  This  is  necessary  since
              the  realtime file is created using direct I/O and the minimum I/O
              is the filesystem block size.

SEE ALSO
       xfs(5), mkfs.xfs(8), mount(8).

CAVEATS
       Currently, realtime partitions are not supported under the Linux  version
       of XFS, and use of a realtime partition WILL CAUSE CORRUPTION on the data
       partition. As such, this command is made available for curious DEVELOPERS
       ONLY at this point in time.
