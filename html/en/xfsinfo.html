DESCRIPTION

       server, and the font catalogues and alternate servers that are available.

              This option specifies the X font server  to  contact.   servername
              must be specified in one of the formats defined in the Font Server
              Names section of X(7).   If not specified, the server name in  the
              FONTSERVER environment variable is used.
