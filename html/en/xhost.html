XHOST(1)                                                                XHOST(1)



NAME
       xhost - server access control program for X

SYNOPSIS
       xhost [[+-]name ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xhost  program is used to add and delete host names or user names to
       the list allowed to make connections to the X server.   In  the  case  of
       hosts,  this provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security.
       It is only  sufficient  for  a  workstation  (single  user)  environment,
       although it does limit the worst abuses.  Environments which require more
       sophisticated measures should implement the user-based mechanism  or  use
       the  hooks  in  the protocol for passing other authentication data to the
       server.

OPTIONS
       Xhost accepts the following command line options  described  below.   For
       security, the options that affect access control may only be run from the
       &quot;controlling host&quot;.  For workstations, this is the same  machine  as  the
       server.  For X terminals, it is the login host.

       -help   Prints a usage message.

       [+]name The  given  name (the plus sign is optional) is added to the list
               allowed to connect to the X server.  The name can be a host  name
               or a complete name (See NAMES for more details).

       -name   The  given name is removed from the list of allowed to connect to
               the server.  The name can be a host name or a complete name  (See
               NAMES  for  more  details).  Existing connections are not broken,
               but new connection attempts will be denied.  Note that  the  cur&#8208;
               rent  machine  is allowed to be removed; however, further connec&#8208;
               tions (including attempts to add it back) will not be  permitted.
               Resetting  the  server  (thereby breaking all connections) is the
               only way to allow local connections again.

       +       Access is granted to everyone, even if they aren&apos;t  on  the  list
               (i.e., access control is turned off).

       -       Access is restricted to only those on the list (i.e., access con&#8208;
               trol is turned on).

       nothing If no command line arguments  are  given,  a  message  indicating
               whether  or  not  access control is currently enabled is printed,
               followed by the list of those allowed to connect.   This  is  the
               only  option  that  may be used from machines other than the con&#8208;
               trolling host.

NAMES
       A complete name has the syntax ``family:name&apos;&apos; where the families are  as
       follows:

       inet      Internet host (IPv4)
       inet6     Internet host (IPv6)
       dnet      DECnet host
       nis       Secure RPC network name
       krb       Kerberos V5 principal
       local     contains only one name, the empty string
       si        Server Interpreted

       The  family  is case insensitive.  The format of the name varies with the
       family.

       When Secure RPC is being used, the  network  independent  netname  (e.g.,
       &quot;nis:unix.uid@domainname&quot;) can be specified, or a local user can be spec&#8208;
       ified with just the username and a trailing at-sign (e.g., &quot;nis:pat@&quot;).

       For backward compatibility with pre-R6 xhost, names that contain  an  at-
       sign (@) are assumed to be in the nis family.  Otherwise they are assumed
       to be Internet addresses. If compiled to support IPv6, then all IPv4  and
       IPv6 addresses returned by getaddrinfo(3) are added to the access list in
       the appropriate inet or inet6 family.

       The local family specifies all the local connections  at  once.  However,
       the  server  interpreted  address  &quot;si:localuser:username&quot; can be used to
       specify a single local user. (See the Xsecurity(7) manual page  for  more
       details.)

       Server  interpreted  addresses consist of a case-sensitive type tag and a
       string representing a given value, separated by a  colon.   For  example,
       &quot;si:hostname:almas&quot;  is  a  server  interpreted address of type hostname,
       with a value of almas.   For more information on the available  forms  of
       server interpreted addresses, see the Xsecurity(7) manual page.

       The  initial  access  control list for display number n may be set by the
       file /etc/Xn.hosts, where n is the display number  of  the  server.   See
       Xserver(1) for details.

DIAGNOSTICS
       For  each name added to the access control list, a line of the form &quot;name
       being added to access control list&quot; is printed.  For  each  name  removed
       from the access control list, a line of the form &quot;name being removed from
       access control list&quot; is printed.

SEE ALSO
       X(7), Xsecurity(7), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xauth(1), getaddrinfo(3)

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display to use.

BUGS
       You can&apos;t specify a display on the command line  because  -display  is  a
       valid  command  line  argument  (indicating  that  you want to remove the
       machine named ``display&apos;&apos; from the access list).

       The X server stores network addresses, not host names, unless you use the
       server-interpreted hostname type address.  If somehow you change a host&apos;s
       network address while the server is still running, and you  are  using  a
       network-address  based  form of authentication, xhost must be used to add
       the new address and/or remove the old address.
