DESCRIPTION
       xindy is the formatter-indepedent command of xindy, the flexible indexing
       system. It takes a raw index as input, and produces a merged, sorted and
       tagged index. Merging, sorting, and tagging is controlled by xindy style
       files.

       Files with the raw index are passed as arguments. If no arguments are
       passed, the raw index will be read from standard input.

       xindy is completely described in its manual that you will find on its Web
       Site, http://www.xindy.org/. A good introductionary description appears
       in the indexing chapter of the LaTeX Companion (2nd ed.)

       If you want to produce an index for LaTeX documents, the command
       texindy(1) is probably more of interest for you. It is a wrapper for
       xindy that turns on many LaTeX conventions by default.

OPTIONS
       &quot;--version&quot; / -V
           output version numbers of all relevant components and exit.

       &quot;--help&quot; / -h / -?
           output usage message with options explanation.

       &quot;--quiet&quot; / -q
           Don&apos;t output progress messages. Output only error messages.

       &quot;--verbose&quot; / -v
           Output verbose progress messages.

       &quot;--debug&quot; magic / -d magic
           Output debug messages, this option may be specified multiple times.
           magic determines what is output:

            magic          remark
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            script         internal progress messages of driver scripts
            keep_tmpfiles  don&apos;t discard temporary files
            markup         output markup trace, as explained in xindy manual
            level=n        log level, n is 0 (default), 1, 2, or 3
&#12;       &quot;--out-file&quot; outfile.ind / -o outfile.ind
           Output index to file outfile.ind. If this option is not passed, the
           name of the output file is the base name of the first argument and
           the file extension ind. If the raw index is read from standard input,
           this option is mandatory.

       &quot;--log-file&quot; log.ilg / -t log.ilg
           Output log messages to file log.ilg. These log messages are
           independent from the progress messages that you can influence with
           &quot;--debug&quot; or &quot;--verbose&quot;.

       &quot;--language&quot; lang / -L lang
           The index is sorted according to the rules of language lang. These
           rules are encoded in a xindy module created by make-rules.

           If no input encoding is specified via &quot;--codepage&quot;, a xindy module
           for that language is searched with a latin, a cp, an iso, or ascii
           encoding, in that order.

       &quot;--codepage&quot; enc / -C enc
           The raw input is in input encoding enc. This information is used to
           select the correct xindy sort module and also the inputenc target
           encoding for &quot;latex&quot; input markup.

           When &quot;omega&quot; input markup is used, &quot;utf8&quot; is always used as codepage,
           this option is then ignored.

       &quot;--module&quot; module / -M module
           Load the xindy module module.xdy. This option may be specified
           multiple times. The modules are searched in the xindy search path
           that can be changed with the environment variable &quot;XINDY_SEARCHPATH&quot;.

       &quot;--input-markup&quot; input / -I input
           Specifies the input markup of the raw index. Supported values for
           input are &quot;latex&quot;, &quot;omega&quot;, and &quot;xindy&quot;.

           &quot;latex&quot; input markup is the one that is emitted by default from the
           LaTeX kernel, or by the &quot;index&quot; macro package of David Jones.
           ^^-notation of single byte characters is supported. Usage of LaTeX&apos;s
           inputenc package is assumed as well.

           &quot;omega&quot; input markup is like &quot;latex&quot; input markup, but with Omega&apos;s
           ^^-notation as encoding for non-ASCII characters. LaTeX inputenc
           encoding is not used then, and &quot;utf8&quot; is enforced to be the codepage.

           &quot;xindy&quot; input markup is specified in the xindy manual.

       &quot;--interactive&quot;
           Start xindy in interactive mode. You will be in a xindy read-eval-
           loop where xindy language expressions are read and evaluated
           interactively.

       &quot;--mem-file&quot; xindy.mem
           This option is only usable for developers or in very rare situations.
           The compiled xindy kernel is stored in a so-called memory file,
           canonically named xindy.mem, and located in the xindy library
           directory. This option allows to use another xindy kernel.

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES / CODEPAGES
       The following languages are supported:

       Latin scripts

        albanian      gypsy             portuguese
        croatian      hausa             romanian
        czech         hungarian         russian-iso
        danish        icelandic         slovak-small
        english       italian           slovak-large
        esperanto     kurdish-bedirxan  slovenian
        estonian      kurdish-turkish   spanish-modern
        finnish       latin             spanish-traditional
        french        latvian           swedish
        general       lithuanian        turkish
        german-din    lower-sorbian     upper-sorbian
        german-duden  norwegian         vietnamese
        greek-iso     polish

       German recognizes two different sorting schemes to handle umlauts:
       normally, &quot;ae&quot; is sorted like &quot;ae&quot;, but in phone books or dictionaries,
       it is sorted like &quot;a&quot;. The first scheme is known as DIN order, the second
       as Duden order.

       &quot;*-iso&quot; language names assume that the raw index entries are in ISO
       8859-9 encoding.

       &quot;gypsy&quot; is a northern Russian dialect.

       Cyrillic scripts

        belarusian    mongolian         serbian
        bulgarian     russian           ukrainian
        macedonian

       Other scripts

        greek         klingon

       Available Codepages

       This is not yet written. You can look them up in your xindy distribution,
       in the modules/lang/language/ directory (where language is your
       language). They are named variant-codepage-lang.xdy, where variant- is
       most often empty (for german, it&apos;s &quot;din5007&quot; and &quot;duden&quot;; for spanish,
       it&apos;s &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot;, etc.)

        &lt; Describe available codepages for each language &gt;

        &lt; Describe relevance of codepages (as internal representation) for
          LaTeX inputenc &gt;

ENVIRONMENT
       &quot;XINDY_SEARCHPATH&quot;
           A list of directories where the xindy modules are searched in. No
           subtree searching is done (as in TDS-conformant TeX).

           If this environment variable is not set, the default is used:
           &quot;.:&quot;modules_dir&quot;:&quot;modules_dir&quot;/base&quot;. modules_dir is determined at
           run time, relative to the xindy command location: Either it&apos;s
           ../modules, that&apos;s the case for opt-installations.  Or it&apos;s
           ../lib/xindy/modules, that&apos;s the case for usr-installations.

       &quot;XINDY_LIBDIR&quot;
           Library directory where xindy.mem is located.

           The modules directory may be a subdirectory, too.

COMPATIBILITY TO MAKEINDEX
       xindy does not claim to be completely compatible with MakeIndex, that
       would prevent some of its enhancements. That said, we strive to deliver
       as much compatibility as possible. The most important incompatibilities
       are

       &#183;   For raw index entries in LaTeX syntax, &quot;\index{aaa|bbb}&quot; is
           interpreted differently. For MakeIndex &quot;bbb&quot; is markup that is output
           as a LaTeX tag for this page number. For xindy, this is a location
           attribute, an abstract identifier that will be later associated with
           markup that should be output for that attribute.

           For straight-forward usage, when &quot;bbb&quot; is &quot;textbf&quot; or similar, we
           supply location attribute definitions that mimic MakeIndex&apos;s
           behaviour.

           For more complex usage, when &quot;bbb&quot; is not an identifier, no such
           compatibility definitions exist and may also not been created with
           current xindy. In particular, this means that by default the LaTeX
           package &quot;hyperref&quot; will create raw index files that cannot be
           processed with xindy. This is not a bug, this is the unfortunate
           result of an intented incompatibility. It is currently not possible
           to get both hyperref&apos;s index links and use xindy.

           A similar situation is reported to exist for the &quot;memoir&quot; LaTeX
           class.

           Programmers who know Common Lisp and Lex and want to work on a remedy
           should please contact the author.

       &#183;   The MakeIndex compatibility definitions support only the default raw
           index syntax and markup definition. It is not possible to configure
           raw index parsing or use a MakeIndex style file to describe output
           markup.

KNOWN ISSUES
       Option -q also prevents output of error messages. Error messages should
       be output on stderr, progress messages on stdout.

       There should be a way to output the final index to stdout. This would
       imply -q, of course.

       LaTeX raw index parsing should be configurable.

       Codepage &quot;utf8&quot; should be supported for all languages, and should be used
       as internal codepage for LaTeX inputenc re-encoding.
