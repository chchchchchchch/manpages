XLITO(1)                                                                XLITO(1)



NAME
       xlito - Append/Delete/Show a Trailing Option string in a file.  (XLoadIm&#8208;
       ageTrailingOptions)

SYNOPSIS
       xlito [option] [string] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       xlito (XLoadImageTrailingOptions) is a utility that provides a file  for&#8208;
       mat  independent  way of marking image files with the appropriate options
       to display correctly.  It does this by appending  to  a  file,  a  string
       specified  by  the  user. The string is marked with some magic numbers so
       that it can be extracted by a program that knows what to look for.  Since
       almost  all  image files have some sort of image dimension information in
       the file, the programs that load or manipulate these files  generally  do
       not  look beyond the point at which they have read the complete image, so
       trailing information is safely be hidden. If appending  this  information
       causes trouble with other utilities, it can simply be deleted.

       Appropriate  version  of  xloadimage  (ie. xli 1.00) will recognise these
       trailing options at the end of the image files, and will treat the embed&#8208;
       ded  string  as if it were a sequence of command line Image Options.  Any
       Global Options will be ignored, and unlike command  line  image  Options,
       Trailing Options are never propagated to other images.

       Old  versions of xloadimage (3.01 or less) can be made forward compatible
       by using the -x option to pull the trailing  options  out  of  the  image
       files, and put them on the command line where xloadimage can see them.

OPTIONS
       The  default  behavior is to display the trailing option strings (if any)
       of the files on the argument line.   The  following  options  change  the
       behavior of xlito:

       -c option_string file_name ...
               This  adds  or changes the embedded string to option_string.  The
               string will have to be quoted if it is composed of more than  one
               word.

       -d file_name ...
               Delete any embedded trailing option strings in the given files.

       -x file_name ...
               Process  the  files and create a command line string suitable for
               use by xloadimage. Arguments starting with -  are  echoed,  argu&#8208;
               ments  not  starting with - are treated as files and any trailing
               options strings are echoed followed by the file name. The  xload&#8208;
               image option -name is treated correctly.

EXAMPLES
       If  fred.gif  has the wrong aspect ratio, then it might need viewing with
       the xloadimage options:

            xloadimage -yzoom 130 fred.gif

       This option can then be appended to the file by:

            xlito -c &quot;-yzoom 130&quot; fred.gif

       and from then on some new versions of xloadimage will get the appropriate
       options  from  the  image  file itself. Old versions of xloadimage can be
       made to work by using:

            xloadimage `xlito -x fred.gif`

       This can be made transparent by using a script containing something like:

            xloadimage `xlito -x $&#8727;`

       The script could be called xli for instance.

       The options can be deleted with:

            xlito -d fred.gif

COMPATIBILITY WITH IMAGE FILES
       Some image files are actually ascii files that are  used  in  other  con&#8208;
       texts.   X  Bitmap  files are an example. They are formatted as &apos;C&apos; style
       #defines and an initialised array of characters,  so  that  they  can  be
       included  in  &apos;C&apos;  source  code.  Adding trailing options would therefore
       render the file unusable with a compiler, since  it  will  get  a  syntax
       error on the railing option string and the magic numbers. The solution to
       this is that xlito will ignore a certain amount  (a  few  hundred  bytes)
       after  the  trailing  options,  and uses a padding of 20 bytes before the
       trailing options. These two areas will be  maintained  when  changing  an
       existing  trailing  option. In the case of an X bitmap then, the solution
       is to edit the file and place the embedded string in some &apos;C&apos; comments:

       eg: say the file starts as:
       #define tt_width 4
       #define tt_height 4
       static char tt_bits[] = {
          0x08, 0x02, 0x04, 0x01};

       and you add a trailing options:
       #define tt_width 4
       #define tt_height 4
       static char tt_bits[] = {
          0x08, 0x02, 0x04, 0x01};
       01234567890123456789XXX        xloadimage        trailing         options
       XXX0007&quot;-smooth&quot;0007XXX
       xloadimage trailing options XXX

       Then the trailing options can be commented out:
       #define tt_width 4
       #define tt_height 4
       static char tt_bits[] = {
          0x08, 0x02, 0x04, 0x01};
       /&#8727;234567890123456789XXX         xloadimage        trailing        options
       XXX0007&quot;-smooth&quot;0007XXX
       xloadimage trailing options XXX &#8727;/

BUGS
       xlito doesn&apos;t cope with compressed files. A files will  need  uncompress&#8208;
       ing, the options added, and then compressing again.
