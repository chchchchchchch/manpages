DESCRIPTION
       xlyap generates and graphically displays an array of  Lyapunov  exponents
       for a variety of iterated periodically forced non-linear maps of the unit
       interval.

OPTIONS
       -random A good choice for use with xscreensaver: picks random  parameters
               from a built-in list.

       -C n    Specifies  the  minimum color index to be used for negative expo&#8208;
               nents

       -D n    Specifies the &quot;dwell&quot; or number of iterations over which to aver&#8208;
               age in order to calculate the Lyapunov exponent. Default is 50.

       -H n    Specifies the height of the window. Default is 256.

       -L      Indicates use log(x) + log(y) rather than log(xy).

       -M r    Specifies the real value to compare exponent values to for index&#8208;
               ing into a color wheel. The default value is 1.0.

       -O n    Specifies the minimum color index to be used for  positive  expo&#8208;
               nents

       -R p    Specifies  pseudo-random  forcing  with  probability  p  of using
               parameter value &apos;a&apos;.

       -S n    Specifies the &quot;settle&quot; or  number  of  iterations  prior  to  the
               beginning of the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent. Default is
               50.

       -a r    Specifies the real value to use as the minimum parameter value of
               the horizontal axis. Default is 2.0 for the logistic map.

       -b n    Specifies the real value to use as the minimum parameter value of
               the vertical axis. Default is 2.0 for the logistic map.

       -c n    Selects one of six different color wheels  to  use.  The  default
               color wheel is a rainbow palette.

       -F 10101010
               Specifies  the  &quot;Function&quot;  forcing  function to use. The example
               above would alternate between iterating the circle  and  logistic
               maps.  An  argument of &quot;-F 2323&quot; would alternate between left and
               right logistic maps. The default is to only use the single speci&#8208;
               fied map (see the description of -m).

       -f abbabaab
               Specifies  the  forcing function to use. The default is to alter&#8208;
               nate between the &quot;a&quot; parameter and the &quot;b&quot; parameter.
&#12;       -h r    Specifies the real value to be used as the range over  which  the
               vertical parameter values vary. The default is 1.0.

       -i r    Specifies the real value of the initial condition to use. Default
               is 0.65.

       -m n    Selects between available non-linear maps of the unit interval. A
               value  of  0 specifies the logistic map. A value of 1, the circle
               map. A value of 2, the left-logistic. A value of  3,  the  right-
               logistic.  A  value  of 4, the double-logistic. The default is 0,
               the logistic map.

       -o filename
               Specifies the output filename to be used. If  the  -o  option  is
               given, this file will automatically be written out at the comple&#8208;
               tion of the drawing.  If it is not specified, a default  filename
               of  lyap.out  is used and only written if the &apos;f&apos; or &apos;F&apos; keys are
               pressed during a run. The format of the output file  is  PPM  for
               color  and  PGM  for monochrome. The parameters used to calculate
               the picture are included as comments at the beginning of the out&#8208;
               put file.

       -p      Switches  color indices for negative and positive exponents. Gen&#8208;
               erally, causes negative exponents to be displayed in more  detail
               while  darkening and narrowing the color range for positive expo&#8208;
               nents. This can be toggled during runtime  by  pressing  the  &apos;p&apos;
               key.

       -r n    Specifies the maximum rgb value to be used. Default is 65000.

       -s n    Specifies the length of the color wheel spin.

       -v      Prints out the various values to be used and exits.

       -w r    Specifies  the  real value to be used as the range over which the
               horizontal parameter values vary. The default is 1.0.



NOTES
       During display, pressing any mouse button allows you to select  the  area
       to  be  investigated  with  the  mouse. The upper left hand corner of the
       desired area is the location of the cursor when the  button  is  pressed.
       The lower right hand corner is specified by the cursor when the button is
       released.

       Institute for its creation. Additional information and ideas were gleaned
       from the discussion on alt.fractals involving Stephen Hall, Ed  Kubaitis,
       Dave  Platt  and Baback Moghaddam. Assistance with colormaps and spinning
       color wheels and X was gleaned from Hiram Clawson.  Rubber  banding  code
       was  adapted  from an existing Mandelbrot program written by Stacey Camp&#8208;
       bell.
