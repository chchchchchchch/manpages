XMAN(1)                                                                  XMAN(1)



NAME
       xman - Manual page display program for the X Window System

SYNOPSIS
       xman [ -options ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xman is a manual page browser.  The default size of the initial xman win&#8208;
       dow is small so that you can leave  it  running  throughout  your  entire
       login  session.  In the initial window there are three options: Help will
       pop up a window with on-line help, Quit will exit, and Manual  Page  will
       pop  up a window with a manual page browser in it.  Typing Control-S will
       pop up a window prompting for a specific manual page to display.  You may
       display  more than one manual page browser window at a time from a single
       execution of xman.

       For further information on using  xman,  please  read  the  on-line  help
       information.  Most of this manual will discuss customization of xman.

OPTIONS
       Xman  supports  all  standard  Toolkit command line arguments (see X(7)).
       The following additional arguments are supported.


       -helpfile filename
              Specifies a helpfile to use other than the default.

       -bothshown
              Allows both the manual page and manual  directory  to  be  on  the
              screen at the same time.

       -notopbox
              Starts without the Top Menu with the three buttons in it.

       -geometry WxH+X+Y
              Sets  the size and location of the Top Menu with the three buttons
              in it.

       -pagesize WxH+X+Y
              Sets the size and location of all the Manual Pages.

CUSTOMIZING XMAN
       Xman allows customization of both the directories to be searched for man&#8208;
       ual  pages,  and the name that each directory will map to in the Sections
       menu.  Xman determines which directories it will search  by  reading  the
       MANPATH  environment variable.  If no MANPATH is found then the directory
       is /usr/man is searched on POSIX systems.  This environment  is  expected
       to be a colon-separated list of directories for xman to search.

       setenv MANPATH /mit/kit/man:/usr/man

       By  default,  xman will search each of the following directories (in each
       of the directories specified in the users MANPATH) for manual pages.   If
       manual  pages exist in that directory then they are added to list of man&#8208;
       ual pages for the corresponding menu item.  A menu item is only displayed
       for those sections that actually contain manual pages.

       Directory      Section Name
       ---------      ------------
       man1           (1) User Commands
       man2           (2) System Calls
       man3           (3) Subroutines
       man4           (4) Devices
       man5           (5) File Formats
       man6           (6) Games
       man7           (7) Miscellaneous
       man8           (8) Sys. Administration
       manl           (l) Local
       mann           (n) New
       mano           (o) Old

       For  instance,  a  user has three directories in her manual path and each
       contain a directory called man3.  All  these  manual  pages  will  appear
       alphabetically sorted when the user selects the menu item called (3) Sub&#8208;
       routines.  If there is no directory called mano in any of the directories
       in  her  MANPATH,  or there are no manual pages in any of the directories
       called mano then no menu item will be displayed for  the  section  called
       (o) Old.

BSD AND LINUX SYSTEMS
       In  newer  BSD  and  Linux  systems,  Xman  will  search for a file named
       /etc/man.conf which will contain the list of directories containing  man&#8208;
       ual pages. See man.conf(5) for a complete description of the file format.

THE MANDESC FILE
       By  using  the  mandesc  file  a  user  or system manager is able to more
       closely control which manual pages will appear in each  of  the  sections
       represented  by  menu  items in the Sections menu.  This functionality is
       only available on a section by section basis, and individual manual pages
       may  not  be  handled in this manner.  (Although generous use of symbolic
       links &#8212; see ln(1) &#8212; will allow almost any configuration you can imagine.)

       The format of the mandesc file is a character followed by a  label.   The
       character  determines  which  of  the  sections  will be added under this
       label.  For instance suppose that you would like to create an extra  menu
       item that contains all programmer subroutines.  This label should contain
       all manual pages in both sections two and three.  The mandesc file  would
       look like this:

       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines

       This  will  add  a  menu  item to the Sections menu that would bring up a
       listing of all manual pages in sections two and three of the  Programmers
       Manual.  Since the label names are exactly the same they will be added to
       the same section. Note, however, that the original sections still exist.

       If you want to completely ignore the default sections in a manual  direc&#8208;
       tory then add the line:

       no default sections

       anywhere  in  your  mandesc  file.   This  keeps  xman from searching the
       default manual sections In that directory only.  As an  example,  suppose
       you  want  to  do the same thing as above, but you don&apos;t think that it is
       useful to have the System Calls or Subroutines sections any longer.   You
       would  need  to duplicate the default entries, as well as adding your new
       one.

       no default sections
       1(1) User Commands
       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines
       4(4) Devices
       5(5) File Formats
       6(6) Games
       7(7) Miscellaneous
       8(8) Sys. Administration
       l(l) Local
       n(n) New
       o(o) Old

       Xman will read any section that is  of  the  from  man&lt;character&gt;,  where
       &lt;character&gt;  is  an  upper  or  lower  case letter (they are treated dis&#8208;
       tinctly) or a numeral (0-9).  Be warned, however, that  man(1)  and  cat&#8208;
       man(8) will not search directories that are non-standard.

WIDGETS
       In  order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
       widgets which compose xman.  In the notation below, indentation indicates
       hierarchical  structure.   The widget class name is given first, followed
       by the widget instance name.

APPLICATION RESOURCES
       xman has the following application-specific resources  which  allow  cus&#8208;
       tomizations unique to xman.

       manualFontNormal (Class Font)
                         The font to use for normal text in the manual pages.

       manualFontBold (Class Font)
                         The font to use for bold text in the manual pages.

       manualFontItalic (Class Font)
                         The font to use for italic text in the manual pages.

       directoryFontNormal (Class Font)
                         The font to use for the directory text.

       bothShown (Class Boolean)
                         Either  `true&apos; or `false,&apos; specifies whether or not you
                         want both the directory and the manual  page  shown  at
                         start up.

       directoryHeight (Class DirectoryHeight)
                         The  height in pixels of the directory, when the direc&#8208;
                         tory and the manual page are shown simultaneously.

       topCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the top box.

       helpCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the help window.

       manpageCursor (Class Cursor)

                         fied  above.  The name was chosen to be compatible with
                         xterm.

       helpFile  (Class File)
                         Use this rather than the system default helpfile.

       topBox (Class Boolean)
                         Either `true&apos; or `false,&apos; determines  whether  the  top
                         box (containing the help, quit and manual page buttons)
                         or a manual page is put on the screen at start-up.  The
                         default is true.

                         The default is horizontal (false).

GLOBAL ACTIONS
       Xman  defines  all  user interaction through global actions.  This allows
       the user to modify the translation table of  any  widget,  and  bind  any
       event to the new user action.  The list of actions supported by xman are:

       GotoPage(page) When  used in a manual page display window this will allow
                      the user to move between a directory and manual page  dis&#8208;
                      play.   The page argument can be either Directory or Manu&#8208;
                      alPage.

       Quit()         This action may be used anywhere, and will exit xman.

       Search(type, action)
                      Only useful when used in a search popup, this action  will
                      cause  the  search widget to perform the named search type
                      on the string in the search  popup&apos;s  value  widget.  This
                      action  will  also  pop  down  the search widget. The type
                      argument can be either Apropos, Manpage or Cancel.  If  an
                      action of Open is specified then xman will open a new man&#8208;
                      ual page to display the results of the  search,  otherwise
                      xman  will attempt to display the results in the parent of
                      the search popup.

       PopupHelp()    This action may be used anywhere, and will popup the  help
                      widget.

       PopupSearch()  This  action may be used anywhere except in a help window.
                      It will cause the search popup to become active and  visi&#8208;
                      ble  on  the screen, allowing the user search for a manual
                      page.

       CreateNewManpage()
                      This action may be used anywhere, and will  create  a  new
                      manual page display window.

       RemoveThisManpage()
                      This action may be used in any manual page or help display
                      window.  When called it will remove the window, and  clean
                      up all resources associated with it.

       SaveFormattedPage(action)
                      This  action can only be used in the likeToSave popup wid&#8208;
                      get, and tells xman whether to Save or Cancel  a  save  of
                      the manual page that has just been formatted.

       ShowVersion()  This  action  may  be  called from any manual page or help
                      display window, and will cause the  informational  display
                      line to show the current version of xman.

FILES
       &lt;manpath directory&gt;/man&lt;character&gt;

       &lt;manpath directory&gt;/cat&lt;character&gt;

       &lt;manpath directory&gt;/mandesc

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/Xman
                                specifies required resources.
&#12;       /tmp                     Xman  creates  temporary  files  in /tmp for all
                                unformatted man pages and all apropos searches.
