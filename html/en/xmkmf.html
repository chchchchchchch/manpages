NAME
       xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

SYNOPSIS
       xmkmf [ -a ] [ topdir [ curdir ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xmkmf  command is the normal way to create a Makefile from an Imake&#8208;
       file shipped with third-party software.

       When invoked with no arguments in a directory  containing  an  Imakefile,
       the imake program is run with arguments appropriate for your system (con&#8208;
       figured into imake when it was built) and generates a Makefile.

       When invoked with the -a option, xmkmf builds the Makefile in the current
       directory,  and  then  automatically executes ``make Makefiles&apos;&apos; (in case
       there are subdirectories), ``make includes&apos;&apos;,  and  ``make  depend&apos;&apos;  for
       you.

       If  a  topdir is given, xmkmf assumes nothing is installed on your system
       and looks for files in the build tree instead of using the installed ver&#8208;
       sions.   Optionally,  curdir may be specified as a relative pathname from
       the top of the build tree to the current directory.  It is  necessary  to
       supply  curdir  if the current directory has subdirectories, or the Make&#8208;
       file will not be able to build the subdirectories.
