XML2PO(1)                        [FIXME: manual]                       XML2PO(1)



NAME
       xml2po - program to create a PO-template file from a DocBook XML file and
       merge it back into a (translated) XML file

SYNOPSIS
       xml2po [OPTIONS] [XMLFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xml2po command.

       xml2po is a simple Python program which extracts translatable content
       from free-form XML documents and outputs gettext compatible POT files.
       Translated PO files can be turned into XML output again.

       It can work it&#180;s magic with most &quot;simple&quot; tags, and for complicated tags
       one has to provide a list of all tags which are &quot;final&quot; (that will be put
       into one &quot;message&quot; in PO file), &quot;ignored&quot; (skipped over) and &quot;space
       preserving&quot;.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-&#180;). A summary of options is included below.

       -a, --automatic-tags
           Automatically decide if tags are to be considered &quot;final&quot; or not.

       -k, --keep-entities
           Don&#180;t expand entities (default). See also the -e option.

       -e, --expand-all-entities
           Expand all entities (including SYSTEM ones).

       -m, --mode=TYPE
           Treat tags as type TYPE (default: docbook).

       -o, --output=FILE
           Print resulting text (XML while merging translations with &quot;-p&quot; or
           &quot;-t&quot; options, POT template file while extracting strings, and
           translated PO file with &quot;-r&quot; option) to the given FILE.

       -p, --po-file=FILE
           Specify a PO FILE containing translation and output XML document with
           translations merged in.

       -r, --reuse=FILE
           Specify a translated XML document in FILE with the same structure to
           generate translated PO file for XML document given on command line.

       -t, --translation=FILE
           Specify a MO file containing translation and output XML document with
           translations merged in.

       -u, --update-translation=LANG.po
           Update a PO file using msgmerge.

       -l, --language=LANG
           Explicitly set language of the translation.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
           Show version of program.

EXAMPLES
   Creating POT template files
       To create a POT template book.pot from an input file book.xml, which
       consists of chapter1.xml and chapter2.xml (external entities), run:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -o book.pot book.xml chapter1.xml chapter2.xml


       To expand entities use the -e option:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -e -o book.pot book.xml


   Creating translated XML files (merging back PO files)
       After translating book.pot into LANG.po, merge the translations back by
       using -p option for each XML file:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o book.LANG.xml book.xml
                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o chapter1.LANG.xml chapter1.xml
                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o chapter2.LANG.xml chapter2.xml


       If you used the -e option to expand entities, you should use it again to
       merge back the translation into an XML file:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -e -p LANG.po -o book.LANG.xml book.xml


   Updating PO files
       When base XML file changes, the real advantages of PO files come to
       surface. There are 2 ways to merge the translation. The first is to
       produce a new POT template file (additionally use the -e if you decided
       earlier to expand entities). Afterwards run msgmerge to merge the
       translation with the new POT file:

                               /usr/bin/msgmerge -o tmp.po LANG.po book.pot


       Now rename tmp.po to LANG.po and update your translation. Alternatively,
       xml2po provides the -u option, which does exactly these two steps for
       you. The advantage is, that it also runs msgfmt to give you a statistical
       output of translation status (count of translated, untranslated and fuzzy
       messages). Additionally use the -e if you decided earlier to expand
       entities:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -u LANG.po book.xml
