NAME
       xmlif - conditional processing instructions for XML

SYNOPSIS
       xmlif [attrib=value...]

DESCRIPTION
       xmlif filters XML according to conditionalizing markup. This can be
       useful for formatting one of several versions of an XML document
       depending on conditions passed to the command.

       Attribute/value pairs from the command line are matched against the
       attributes associated with certain processing instructions in the
       document. The instructions are &lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif if
       not?&gt;, &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif elif not?&gt;, &lt;?xmlif else?&gt;,
       and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt;.

       Argument/value pairs given on the command line are checked against the
       value of corresponding attributes in the conditional processing
       instructions. An `attribute match&apos; happens if an attribute occurs in both
       the command-line arguments and the tag, and the values match. An
       `attribute mismatch&apos; happens if an attribute occurs in both the
       command-line arguments and the tag, but the values do not match.

       Spans between &lt;?xmlif if?&gt; or &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; and the next conditional
       processing instruction at the same nesting level are passed through
       unaltered if there is at least one attribute match and no attribute
       mismatch; spans between &lt;?xmlif if not?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif not?&gt; and the
       next conditional processing instruction are passed otherwise. Spans
       between &lt;?xmlif else?&gt; and the next conditional-processing tag are passed
       through only if no previous span at the same level has been passed
       through.  &lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt; (and their `not&apos; variants) change
       the current nesting level; &lt;?xmlif else?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; do not.

       All these processing instructions will be removed from the output
       produced. Aside from the conditionalization, all other input is passed
       through untouched; in particular, entity references are not resolved.

       Value matching is by string equality, except that &quot;|&quot; in an attribute
       value is interpreted as an alternation character. Thus, saying
       foo=&apos;red|blue&apos; on the command line enables conditions red and blue.
       Saying color=&apos;black|white&apos; in a tag matches command-line conditions
       color=&apos;black&apos; and color=&apos;white&apos;.

       Here is an example:

           Always issue this text.
           &lt;?xmlif if condition=&apos;html&apos;?&gt;
           Issue this text if &apos;condition=html&apos; is given on the command line.
           &lt;?xmlif elif condition=&apos;pdf|ps&apos;?&gt;
           Issue this text if &apos;condition=pdf&apos; or &apos;condition=ps&apos;
           is given on the command line.
           &lt;?xmlif else?&gt;
           Otherwise issue this text.
           &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt;
           Always issue this text.
