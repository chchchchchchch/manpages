XMODMAP(1)                                                            XMODMAP(1)



NAME
       xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X

SYNOPSIS
       xmodmap [-options ...] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The xmodmap program is used to edit and display the keyboard modifier map
       and keymap table that are used by client applications  to  convert  event
       keycodes into keysyms.  It is usually run from the user&apos;s session startup
       script to configure the keyboard according to personal tastes.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with xmodmap:

       -display display
               This option specifies the host and display to use.

       -help   This option indicates that a brief  description  of  the  command
               line  arguments  should be printed on the standard error channel.
               This will be done whenever an  unhandled  argument  is  given  to
               xmodmap.

       -grammar
               This  option indicates that a help message describing the expres&#8208;
               sion grammar used in files and  with  -e  expressions  should  be
               printed on the standard error.

       -verbose
               This  option indicates that xmodmap should print logging informa&#8208;
               tion as it parses its input.

       -quiet  This option turns off the verbose logging.  This is the default.

       -n      This option indicates that xmodmap should  not  change  the  map&#8208;
               pings,  but  should  display  what it would do, like make(1) does
               when given this option.

       -e expression
               This option specifies an expression to be executed.   Any  number
               of expressions may be specified from the command line.

       -pm     This  option  indicates  that  the current modifier map should be
               printed on the standard output.   This is  the  default  mode  of
               operation if no other mode options are specified.

       -pk     This  option  indicates  that  the current keymap table should be
               printed on the standard output.

       -pke    This option indicates that the current  keymap  table  should  be
               printed  on  the  standard output in the form of expressions that
               can be fed back to xmodmap.

       -pp     This option indicates that the  current  pointer  map  should  be
               printed on the standard output.

       -       A  lone  dash means that the standard input should be used as the
               input file.

       The filename specifies a file containing xmodmap expressions to  be  exe&#8208;
       cuted.   This  file  is  usually kept in the user&apos;s home directory with a
       name like .xmodmaprc.

EXPRESSION GRAMMAR
       The xmodmap program reads a list  of  expressions  and  parses  them  all
       before  attempting  to  execute  any  of them.  This makes it possible to
       refer to keysyms that are being redefined in a natural way without having
       to worry as much about name conflicts.

       The   list   of   keysym   names   may   be  found  in  the  header  file
       &lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt; (without the XK_ prefix), supplemented  by  the  keysym
       database   /usr/share/X11/XKeysymDB.  Keysyms matching Unicode characters
       may be specified as &quot;U0020&quot; to &quot;U007E&quot; and &quot;U00A0&quot; to &quot;U10FFFF&quot;  for  all
       possible Unicode characters.

       keycode NUMBER = KEYSYMNAME ...
               The  list  of keysyms is assigned to the indicated keycode (which
               may be specified in decimal, hex or octal and can  be  determined
               by running the xev program).  Up to eight keysyms may be attached
               to a key, however the last four are  not  used  in  any  major  X
               server implementation.  The first keysym is used when no modifier
               key is pressed in conjunction with  this  key,  the  second  with
               Shift,  the  third when the Mode_switch key is used with this key
               and the fourth when both the Mode_switch and Shift keys are used.

       keycode any = KEYSYMNAME ...
               If no existing key has the specified list of keysyms assigned  to
               it,  a  spare key on the keyboard is selected and the keysyms are
               assigned to it.  The list of keysyms may be specified in decimal,
               hex or octal.

       keysym KEYSYMNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
               The  KEYSYMNAME on the left hand side is translated into matching
               keycodes used to perform the corresponding set of keycode expres&#8208;
               sions.   Note  that if the same keysym is bound to multiple keys,
               the expression is executed for each matching keycode.

       clear MODIFIERNAME
               This removes all entries in the modifier map for the given  modi&#8208;
               fier,  where  valid  name  are: Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2,
               Mod3, Mod4, and Mod5 (case does not  matter  in  modifier  names,
               although  it  does  matter  for  all  other names).  For example,
               ``clear Lock&apos;&apos; will remove all any keys that were  bound  to  the
               shift lock modifier.

       add MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
               This  adds all keys containing the given keysyms to the indicated
               modifier map.  The keysym names are  evaluated  after  all  input
               expressions are read to make it easy to write expressions to swap
               keys (see the EXAMPLES section).

       remove MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
               This removes all keys containing the given keysyms from the indi&#8208;
               cated  modifier  map.  Unlike add, the keysym names are evaluated
               as the line is read in.  This allows you to remove  keys  from  a
               modifier  without  having to worry about whether or not they have
               been reassigned.

       pointer = default
               This sets the pointer map back to its default settings (button  1
               generates a code of 1, button 2 generates a 2, etc.).

       pointer = NUMBER ...
               This  sets the pointer map to contain the indicated button codes.
               The list always starts with the first physical button.  Setting a
               button code to 0 disables events from that button.

       Lines that begin with an exclamation point (!) are taken as comments.

       If you want to change the binding of a modifier key, you must also remove
       it from the appropriate modifier map.

EXAMPLES
       Many pointers are designed such that the first button  is  pressed  using
       the  index  finger  of  the  right hand.  People who are left-handed fre&#8208;
       quently find that it is more comfortable to reverse the button codes that
       get  generated so that the primary button is pressed using the index fin&#8208;
       ger of the left hand.  This could be done on a 3 button pointer  as  fol&#8208;
       lows:
       %  xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1&quot;

       Many  applications  support  the  notion of Meta keys (similar to Control
       keys except that Meta is held down instead of  Control).   However,  some
       servers  do  not  have  a Meta keysym in the default keymap table, so one
       needs to be added by hand.  The following command will attach Meta to the
       Multi-language  key (sometimes labeled Compose Character).  It also takes
       advantage of the fact that applications that need a Meta key simply  need
       to get the keycode and don&apos;t require the keysym to be in the first column
       of the keymap table.  This means that applications that are looking for a
       Multi_key (including the default modifier map) won&apos;t notice any change.
       %  xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Multi_key = Multi_key Meta_L&quot;

       Similarly,  some keyboards have an Alt key but no Meta key.  In that case
       the following may be useful:
       %  xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L&quot;

       One of the more simple, yet convenient, uses of xmodmap  is  to  set  the
       keyboard&apos;s &quot;rubout&quot; key to generate an alternate keysym.  This frequently
       involves exchanging Backspace with Delete to be more comfortable  to  the
       user.   If  the  ttyModes  resource in xterm is set as well, all terminal
       emulator windows will use the same key for erasing characters:
       %  xmodmap -e &quot;keysym BackSpace = Delete&quot;
       %  echo &quot;XTerm*ttyModes:  erase ^?&quot; | xrdb -merge

       Some keyboards do not automatically generate less than and  greater  than
       characters when the comma and period keys are shifted.  This can be reme&#8208;
       died with xmodmap by resetting the bindings for the comma and period with
       the following scripts:
       !
       ! make shift-, be &lt; and shift-. be &gt;
       !
       keysym comma = comma less
       keysym period = period greater

       One  of the more irritating differences between keyboards is the location
       of the Control and Shift Lock keys.  A common use of xmodmap is  to  swap
       these two keys as follows:
       !
       ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
       !
       remove Lock = Caps_Lock
       remove Control = Control_L
       keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
       keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
       add Lock = Caps_Lock
       add Control = Control_L

       This  example  can  be  run again to swap the keys back to their previous
       assignments.

       The keycode command is useful for assigning the same keysym  to  multiple
       keycodes.   Although  unportable,  it  also  makes  it  possible to write
       scripts that can reset the keyboard to  a  known  state.   The  following
       script  sets  the  backspace  key  to  generate  Delete (as shown above),
       flushes all existing caps lock bindings, makes the CapsLock key be a con&#8208;
       trol key, make F5 generate Escape, and makes Break/Reset be a shift lock.
       !
       ! On the HP, the following keycodes have key caps as listed:
       !
       !     101  Backspace
       !      55  Caps
       !      14  Ctrl
       !      15  Break/Reset
       !      86  Stop
       !      89  F5
       !
       keycode 101 = Delete
       keycode 55 = Control_R
       clear Lock
       add Control = Control_R
       keycode 89 = Escape
       keycode 15 = Caps_Lock
       add Lock = Caps_Lock

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get default host and display number.

BUGS
       Every time a keycode expression is evaluated, the server generates a Map&#8208;
       pingNotify event on every client.  This can cause some thrashing.  All of
       the changes should be batched together and done at  once.   Clients  that
       receive  keyboard  input  and ignore MappingNotify events will not notice
       any changes made to keyboard mappings.

       Xmodmap should generate  &quot;add&quot;  and  &quot;remove&quot;  expressions  automatically
       whenever a keycode that is already bound to a modifier is changed.

       There  should  be  a way to have the remove expression accept keycodes as
       well as keysyms for those times when you really mess up your mappings.
