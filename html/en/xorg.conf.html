xorg.conf(5)                                                        xorg.conf(5)



NAME
       xorg.conf, xorg.conf.d - configuration files for Xorg X server

INTRODUCTION
       Xorg  supports  several  mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration
       and run-time parameters: command line options, environment variables, the
       xorg.conf  and xorg.conf.d configuration files, auto-detection, and fall&#8208;
       back defaults. When the same information is supplied  in  more  than  one
       way,  the highest precedence mechanism is used. The list of mechanisms is
       ordered from highest precedence to lowest. Note that not  all  parameters
       can  be  supplied via all methods. The available command line options and
       environment variables (and some defaults) are described in the Xserver(1)
       and  Xorg(1) manual pages. Most configuration file parameters, with their
       defaults, are described below. Driver and module  specific  configuration
       parameters are described in the relevant driver or module manual page.

DESCRIPTION
       Xorg  uses  a configuration file called xorg.conf and files ending in the
       suffix .conf from the directory xorg.conf.d for its initial  setup.   The
       xorg.conf configuration file is searched for in the following places when
       the server is started as a normal user:

           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /usr/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
           /usr/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf
           /etc/xorg.conf
           /usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
           /usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf
           /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
           /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf

       where &lt;cmdline&gt; is a relative path (with no  &#8220;..&#8221;  components)  specified
       with  the  -config  command line option, $XORGCONFIG is the relative path
       (with no &#8220;..&#8221; components) specified by  that  environment  variable,  and
       &lt;hostname&gt; is the machine&apos;s hostname as reported by gethostname(3).

       When  the  Xorg  server  is  started  by the &#8220;root&#8221; user, the config file
       search locations are as follows:

           &lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /usr/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           $XORGCONFIG
           /etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
           /usr/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf
           /etc/xorg.conf
           /usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
           /usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf
           /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
           /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf

       where &lt;cmdline&gt; is the path  specified  with  the  -config  command  line
       option (which may be absolute or relative), $XORGCONFIG is the path spec&#8208;
       ified by that environment variable (absolute or relative), $HOME  is  the
       path specified by that environment variable (usually the home directory),
       and &lt;hostname&gt; is the machine&apos;s hostname as reported by gethostname(3).

       Additional configuration files are searched for in the following directo&#8208;
       ries when the server is started as a normal user:

           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

       where  &lt;cmdline&gt;  is  a relative path (with no &#8220;..&#8221; components) specified
       with the -configdir command line option.

       When the Xorg server is started by the &#8220;root&#8221; user, the config  directory
       search locations are as follows:

           &lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
           /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

       where  &lt;cmdline&gt;  is  the path specified with the -configdir command line
       option (which may be absolute or relative).

       Finally, configuration files will also be  searched  for  in  directories
       reserved  for  system use. These are to separate configuration files from
       the vendor or 3rd party packages  from  those  of  local  administration.
       These files are found in the following directories:

           /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
           /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d

       The  xorg.conf and xorg.conf.d files are composed of a number of sections
       which may be present in any order, or omitted to use  default  configura&#8208;
       tion values.  Each section has the form:

           Section  &quot;SectionName&quot;
               SectionEntry
               ...
           EndSection

       The section names are:

           Files          File pathnames
           ServerFlags    Server flags
           Module         Dynamic module loading
           Extensions     Extension enabling
           InputDevice    Input device description
           InputClass     Input class description
           Device         Graphics device description
           VideoAdaptor   Xv video adaptor description
           Monitor        Monitor description
           Modes          Video modes descriptions
           Screen         Screen configuration
           ServerLayout   Overall layout
           DRI            DRI-specific configuration
           Vendor         Vendor-specific configuration

       The following obsolete section names are still recognised for compatibil&#8208;
       ity purposes.  In new config files, the  InputDevice  section  should  be
       used instead.

           Keyboard       Keyboard configuration
           Pointer        Pointer/mouse configuration

       The old XInput section is no longer recognised.

       The  ServerLayout  sections are at the highest level.  They bind together
       the input and output devices that will be used in a session.   The  input
       devices  are  described in the InputDevice sections.  Output devices usu&#8208;
       ally consist of multiple independent components (e.g., a  graphics  board
       and  a  monitor).   These  multiple  components are bound together in the
       Screen sections, and it is these that are referenced by the  ServerLayout
       section.  Each Screen section binds together a graphics board and a moni&#8208;
       tor.  The graphics boards are described in the Device sections,  and  the
       monitors are described in the Monitor sections.

       Config  file  keywords  are  case-insensitive,  and  &#8220;_&#8221;  characters  are
       ignored.  Most strings (including Option names)  are  also  case-insensi&#8208;
       tive, and insensitive to white space and &#8220;_&#8221; characters.

       Each  config file entry usually takes up a single line in the file.  They
       consist of a keyword, which is possibly followed by  one  or  more  argu&#8208;
       ments,  with  the number and types of the arguments depending on the key&#8208;
       word.  The argument types are:

           Integer     an integer number in decimal, hex or octal
           Real        a floating point number
           String      a string enclosed in double quote marks (&quot;)

       Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with  &#8220;0x&#8221;,  and  octal  values
       with &#8220;0&#8221;.

       A  special keyword called Option may be used to provide free-form data to
       various components of the server.  The Option keyword takes either one or
       two  string  arguments.   The  first is the option name, and the optional
       second argument is the option value.  Some  commonly  used  option  value
       types include:

           Integer     an integer number in decimal, hex or octal
           Real        a floating point number
           String      a sequence of characters
           Boolean     a boolean value (see below)
           Frequency   a frequency value (see below)

       Note  that  all  Option  values,  not  just  strings, must be enclosed in
       quotes.

       Boolean options may optionally have a value specified.  When no value  is
       specified, the option&apos;s value is TRUE.  The following boolean option val&#8208;
       ues are recognised as TRUE:

           1, on, true, yes

       and the following boolean option values are recognised as FALSE:

           0, off, false, no

       If an option name is  prefixed  with  &quot;No&quot;,  then  the  option  value  is
       negated.

       Example: the following option entries are equivalent:

           Option &quot;Accel&quot;   &quot;Off&quot;
           Option &quot;NoAccel&quot;
           Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;On&quot;
           Option &quot;Accel&quot;   &quot;false&quot;
           Option &quot;Accel&quot;   &quot;no&quot;

       Frequency  option values consist of a real number that is optionally fol&#8208;
       lowed by one of the following frequency units:

           Hz, k, kHz, M, MHz

       When the unit name is omitted, the correct units will be determined  from
       the value and the expectations of the appropriate range of the value.  It
       is recommended that the units always be specified  when  using  frequency
       option values to avoid any errors in determining the value.

FILES SECTION
       The  Files  section  is  used  to specify some path names required by the
       server.  Some of these paths can also be set from the command  line  (see
       Xserver(1)  and  Xorg(1)).  The command line settings override the values
       specified in the config file.  The Files section is optional, as are  all
       of the entries that may appear in it.

       The entries that can appear in this section are:

       FontPath &quot;path&quot;
              sets  the  search  path for fonts.  This path is a comma separated
              list of font path elements which the Xorg server searches for font
              databases.   Multiple  FontPath entries may be specified, and they
              will be concatenated to build up the fontpath used by the  server.
              Font  path  elements  can  be  absolute directory paths, catalogue
              directories or a font server identifier. The formats of the  later
              two are explained below:

              Catalogue directories:

                  Catalogue  directories can be specified using the prefix cata&#8208;
                  logue: before the directory name. The directory  can  then  be
                  populated with symlinks pointing to the real font directories,
                  using the following syntax in the symlink name:

                      &lt;identifier&gt;:[attribute]:pri=&lt;priority&gt;

                  where &lt;identifier&gt; is an alphanumeric identifier,  [attribute]
                  is an attribute which will be passed to the underlying FPE and
                  &lt;priority&gt; is a number used to order the fontfile FPEs.  Exam&#8208;
                  ples:

                      75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
                      gscript:pri=60 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
                      misc:unscaled:pri=10 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc

              Font server identifiers:

                  Font server identifiers have the form:

                      &lt;trans&gt;/&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port-number&gt;

                  where  &lt;trans&gt;  is the transport type to use to connect to the
                  font server (e.g., unix for UNIX-domain sockets or tcp  for  a
                  TCP/IP  connection), &lt;hostname&gt; is the hostname of the machine
                  running the font server, and &lt;port-number&gt; is the port  number
                  that the font server is listening on (usually 7100).

              When  this  entry  is not specified in the config file, the server
              falls back to the compiled-in default font  path,  which  contains
              the  following font path elements (which can be set inside a cata&#8208;
              logue directory):

                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/
                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/
                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/OTF/
                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1/
                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/
                  /usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/

              Font path elements that are found to be invalid are  removed  from
              the font path when the server starts up.

       ModulePath &quot;path&quot;
              sets  the search path for loadable Xorg server modules.  This path
              is a comma separated list of directories  which  the  Xorg  server
              searches  for  loadable  modules  loading  in the order specified.
              Multiple ModulePath entries may be specified,  and  they  will  be
              concatenated  to  build the module search path used by the server.
              The default module path is

                  /usr/lib/xorg/modules

       XkbDir &quot;path&quot;
              sets the base directory for keyboard layout  files.   The  -xkbdir
              command  line  option  can  be used to override this.  The default
              directory is

                  /usr/share/X11/xkb

SERVERFLAGS SECTION
       In addition to options specific to this section  (described  below),  the
       ServerFlags  section  is used to specify some global Xorg server options.
       All of the entries in this section are Options, although for  compatibil&#8208;
       ity  purposes  some of the old style entries are still recognised.  Those
       old style entries are not documented here, and using them is discouraged.
       The ServerFlags section is optional, as are the entries that may be spec&#8208;
       ified in it.

       Options specified in this section (with the exception  of  the  &quot;Default&#8208;
       ServerLayout&quot;  Option)  may  be  overridden  by  Options specified in the
       active ServerLayout section.  Options with command line  equivalents  are
       overridden  when  their  command  line  equivalent  is used.  The options
       recognised by this section are:

       Option &quot;DefaultServerLayout&quot;  &quot;layout-id&quot;
              This specifies the default ServerLayout  section  to  use  in  the
              absence of the -layout command line option.

       Option &quot;NoTrapSignals&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  prevents the Xorg server from trapping a range of unexpected
              fatal signals and exiting cleanly.  Instead, the Xorg server  will
              die and drop core where the fault occurred.  The default behaviour
              is for the Xorg server to exit cleanly,  but  still  drop  a  core
              file.  In general you never want to use this option unless you are
              debugging an Xorg server problem and know how  to  deal  with  the
              consequences.

       Option &quot;UseSIGIO&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  controls  whether  the Xorg server requests that events from
              input devices be reported via a SIGIO signal handler  (also  known
              as  SIGPOLL  on some platforms), or only reported via the standard
              select(3) loop.  The default behaviour is platform specific.    In
              general  you  do not want to use this option unless you are debug&#8208;
              ging the Xorg server, or working around a specific bug until it is
              fixed, and understand the consequences.

       Option &quot;DontVTSwitch&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  disallows  the  use  of  the  Ctrl+Alt+Fn sequence (where Fn
              refers to one of the numbered function keys).   That  sequence  is
              normally used to switch to another &quot;virtual terminal&quot; on operating
              systems that have this feature.  When this option is enabled, that
              key  sequence  has  no  special  meaning and is passed to clients.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;DontZap&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This disallows the use of the Terminate_Server XKB action (usually
              on  Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, depending on XKB options).  This action is
              normally used to terminate the Xorg server.  When this  option  is
              enabled, the action has no effect.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;DontZoom&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This   disallows   the   use   of   the  Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus  and
              Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus sequences.  These sequences  allows  you  to
              switch  between  video  modes.  When this option is enabled, those
              key sequences have no special meaning and are passed  to  clients.
              Default: off.

       Option &quot;DisableVidModeExtension&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This disables the parts of the VidMode extension used by the xvid&#8208;
              tune client that can be used to change the video modes.   Default:
              the VidMode extension is enabled.

       Option &quot;AllowNonLocalXvidtune&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  allows  the  xvidtune client (and other clients that use the
              VidMode extension) to connect from another host.  Default: off.

       Option &quot;AllowMouseOpenFail&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              This tells the mousedrv(4) and vmmouse(4) drivers  to  not  report
              failure  if  the mouse device can&apos;t be opened/initialised.  It has
              no effect on the evdev(4) or other drivers.  Default: false.

       Option &quot;BlankTime&quot;  &quot;time&quot;
              sets the inactivity timeout for the blank  phase  of  the  screen&#8208;
              saver.   time  is  in  minutes.   This  is  equivalent to the Xorg
              server&apos;s -s flag, and the value can be changed  at  run-time  with
              xset(1).  Default: 10 minutes.

       Option &quot;StandbyTime&quot;  &quot;time&quot;
              sets  the  inactivity  timeout for the standby phase of DPMS mode.
              time is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time  with
              xset(1).   Default:  10  minutes.   This is only suitable for VESA
              DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported  by  all  video
              drivers.   It  is  only  enabled  for screens that have the &quot;DPMS&quot;
              option set (see the MONITOR section below).

       Option &quot;SuspendTime&quot;  &quot;time&quot;
              sets the inactivity timeout for the suspend phase  of  DPMS  mode.
              time  is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with
              xset(1).  Default: 10 minutes.  This is  only  suitable  for  VESA
              DPMS  compatible  monitors,  and may not be supported by all video
              drivers.  It is only enabled for  screens  that  have  the  &quot;DPMS&quot;
              option set (see the MONITOR section below).

       Option &quot;OffTime&quot;  &quot;time&quot;
              sets  the inactivity timeout for the off phase of DPMS mode.  time
              is in minutes, and the value  can  be  changed  at  run-time  with
              xset(1).   Default:  10  minutes.   This is only suitable for VESA
              DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported  by  all  video
              drivers.   It  is  only  enabled  for screens that have the &quot;DPMS&quot;
              option set (see the MONITOR section below).

       Option &quot;Pixmap&quot;  &quot;bpp&quot;
              This sets the pixmap format to use for depth 24.   Allowed  values
              for  bpp  are  24  and  32.  Default: 32 unless driver constraints
              don&apos;t allow this (which is rare).  Note: some clients don&apos;t behave
              well when this value is set to 24.

       Option &quot;NoPM&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables  something  to do with power management events.  Default:
              PM enabled on platforms that support it.

       Option &quot;Xinerama&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              enable or disable XINERAMA extension.  Default is disabled.
&#12;       Option &quot;AIGLX&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              enable or disable AIGLX. AIGLX is enabled by default.

       Option &quot;DRI2&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              enable or disable DRI2. DRI2 is disabled by default.

       Option &quot;GlxVisuals&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              This option controls how many GLX visuals the GLX modules sets up.
              The default value is typical, which will setup up a typical subset
              of the GLXFBConfigs provided by the driver as GLX visuals.   Other
              options  are minimal, which will set up the minimal set allowed by
              the GLX specification and all which will setup GLX visuals for all
              GLXFBConfigs.

       Option &quot;UseDefaultFontPath&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Include the default font path even if other paths are specified in
              xorg.conf. If enabled, other font  paths  are  included  as  well.
              Enabled by default.

       Option &quot;IgnoreABI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Allow modules built for a different, potentially incompatible ver&#8208;
              sion of the X server to load. Disabled by default.

       Option &quot;AutoAddDevices&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              If this option is disabled, then no devices will be added from the
              HAL or udev backends. Enabled by default.

       Option &quot;AutoEnableDevices&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              If  this  option  is disabled, then the devices will be added (and
              the DevicePresenceNotify event sent), but not enabled, thus  leav&#8208;
              ing policy up to the client.  Enabled by default.

       Option &quot;Log&quot; &quot;string&quot;
              This  option  controls whether the log is flushed and/or synced to
              disk after each message.   Possible  values  are  flush  or  sync.
              Unset by default.

MODULE SECTION
       The Module section is used to specify which Xorg server modules should be
       loaded.  This section is ignored when the Xorg server is built in  static
       form.   The  type  of  modules  normally  loaded in this section are Xorg
       server extension modules.  Most other module types are  loaded  automati&#8208;
       cally  when  they are needed via other mechanisms.  The Module section is
       optional, as are all of the entries that may be specified in it.

       Entries in this section may be in two forms.  The first and most commonly
       used form is an entry that uses the Load keyword, as described here:

       Load  &quot;modulename&quot;
              This  instructs  the  server to load the module called modulename.
              The module name given should be the module&apos;s  standard  name,  not
              the  module  file  name.  The standard name is case-sensitive, and
              does not include the &#8220;lib&#8221; prefix, or the  &#8220;.a&#8221;,  &#8220;.o&#8221;,  or  &#8220;.so&#8221;
              suffixes.

              Example: the DRI extension module can be loaded with the following
              entry:

                  Load &quot;dri&quot;

       Disable  &quot;modulename&quot;
              This instructs the server to not load the  module  called  module&#8208;
              name.   Some modules are loaded by default in the server, and this
              overrides that default. If a Load instruction  is  given  for  the
              same  module,  it overrides the Disable instruction and the module
              is loaded. The module name given should be the  module&apos;s  standard
              name,  not the module file name. As with the Load instruction, the
              standard name is case-sensitive, and does not  include  the  &quot;lib&quot;
              prefix, or the &quot;.a&quot;, &quot;.o&quot;, or &quot;.so&quot; suffixes.

       The  second form of entry is a SubSection, with the subsection name being
       the module name, and the contents of the SubSection  being  Options  that
       are passed to the module when it is loaded.

       Example:  the  extmod  module  (which  contains  a miscellaneous group of
       server extensions) can be loaded, with the XFree86-DGA extension disabled
       by using the following entry:

           SubSection &quot;extmod&quot;
              Option  &quot;omit XFree86-DGA&quot;
           EndSubSection

       Modules  are  searched  for in each directory specified in the ModulePath
       search path, and in the drivers, extensions, input, internal, and  multi&#8208;
       media  subdirectories of each of those directories.  In addition to this,
       operating system specific subdirectories of all the  above  are  searched
       first if they exist.

       To  see what extension modules are available, check the extensions subdi&#8208;
       rectory under:

           /usr/lib/xorg/modules

       The &#8220;extmod&#8221;, &#8220;dbe&#8221;, &#8220;dri&#8221;, &#8220;dri2&#8221;, &#8220;glx&#8221;, and &#8220;record&#8221; extension modules
       are loaded automatically, if they are present, unless disabled with &quot;Dis&#8208;
       able&quot; entries.  It is recommended that at very least the &#8220;extmod&#8221;  exten&#8208;
       sion module be loaded.  If it isn&apos;t, some commonly used server extensions
       (like the SHAPE extension) will not be available.

EXTENSIONS SECTION
       The Extensions section is used to specify which X11  protocol  extensions
       should  be  enabled  or disabled.  The Extensions section is optional, as
       are all of the entries that may be specified in it.

       Entries in this section are listed as Option statements with the name  of
       the  extension  as the first argument, and a boolean value as the second.
       The extension name is case-sensitive, and matches the form shown  in  the
       output of &quot;Xorg -extension ?&quot;.

              Example:  the MIT-SHM extension can be disabled with the following
              entry:

                  Section &quot;Extensions&quot;
                      Option &quot;MIT-SHM&quot; &quot;Disable&quot;
                  EndSection

INPUTDEVICE SECTION
       The config file may have multiple InputDevice sections.  Recent X servers
       employ  HAL  or udev backends for input device enumeration and input hot&#8208;
       plugging. It is usually not necessary to provide InputDevice sections  in
       the  xorg.conf if hotplugging is in use (i.e. AutoAddDevices is enabled).
       If hotplugging is enabled, InputDevice sections using the mouse, kbd  and
       vmmouse driver will be ignored.

       If  hotplugging is disabled, there will normally be at least two: one for
       the core (primary) keyboard and one for the core pointer.  If  either  of
       these  two  is missing, a default configuration for the missing ones will
       be used. In the absence of an explicitly specified core input device, the
       first  InputDevice  marked  as CorePointer (or CoreKeyboard) is used.  If
       there is no match there, the first InputDevice that uses the &#8220;mouse&#8221;  (or
       &#8220;kbd&#8221;)  driver  is  used.   The final fallback is to use built-in default
       configurations.  Currently the default  configuration  may  not  work  as
       expected on all platforms.
&#12;       InputDevice sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;InputDevice&quot;
               Identifier &quot;name&quot;
               Driver     &quot;inputdriver&quot;
               options
               ...
           EndSection

       The  Identifier  and  Driver entries are required in all InputDevice sec&#8208;
       tions.  All other entries are optional.

       The Identifier entry specifies the unique name  for  this  input  device.
       The  Driver  entry specifies the name of the driver to use for this input
       device.  When using the loadable server, the input driver module  &quot;input&#8208;
       driver&quot;  will be loaded for each active InputDevice section.  An InputDe&#8208;
       vice section is considered active  if  it  is  referenced  by  an  active
       ServerLayout  section,  if  it is referenced by the -keyboard or -pointer
       command line options, or if it is selected implicitly as the core pointer
       or  keyboard device in the absence of such explicit references.  The most
       commonly used input drivers are evdev(4) on Linux systems, and kbd(4) and
       mousedrv(4) on other platforms.

       InputDevice sections recognise some driver-independent Options, which are
       described here.  See the individual  input  driver  manual  pages  for  a
       description of the device-specific options.

       Option &quot;AutoServerLayout&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              Always  add  the  device  to the ServerLayout section used by this
              instance of the server. This affects implied layouts  as  well  as
              explicit layouts specified in the configuration and/or on the com&#8208;
              mand line.

       Option &quot;CorePointer&quot;
              Deprecated, see Floating

       Option &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
              Deprecated, see Floating

       Option &quot;AlwaysCore&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              Deprecated, see Floating

       Option &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              Deprecated, see Floating


       Option &quot;Floating&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              When enabled, the input device is set up  floating  and  does  not
              report  events  through any master device or control a cursor. The
              device is only available to clients using the  X  Input  Extension
              API. This option is disabled by default.  The options CorePointer,
              CoreKeyboard, AlwaysCore, and SendCoreEvents, are the  inverse  of
              option Floating (i.e.  SendCoreEvents &quot;on&quot; is equivalent to Float&#8208;
              ing &quot;off&quot; ).

              This option controls the startup behavior only, a  device  may  be
              reattached or set floating at runtime.

       Option &quot;TransformationMatrix&quot; &quot;a b c d e f g h i&quot;
              Specifies   the  3x3  transformation  matrix  for  absolute  input
              devices. The input device will be bound to the area given  in  the
              matrix.  In most configurations, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; specify the width and
              height of the area the device is bound to, and &quot;c&quot; and &quot;f&quot; specify
              the  x and y offset of the area.  The value range is 0 to 1, where
              1 represents the width or height of all root windows together, 0.5
              represents  half the area, etc. The values represent a 3x3 matrix,
              with the first, second and third group of three values  represent&#8208;
              ing  the  first, second and third row of the matrix, respectively.
              The identity matrix is &quot;1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1&quot;.

   POINTER ACCELERATION
       For pointing devices, the following options control how  the  pointer  is
       accelerated  or  decelerated with respect to physical device motion. Most
       of these can be adjusted at runtime,  see  the  xinput(1)  man  page  for
       details. Only the most important acceleration options are discussed here.

       Option &quot;AccelerationProfile&quot;  &quot;integer&quot;
              Select the profile. In layman&apos;s terms, the profile constitutes the
              &quot;feeling&quot; of the acceleration. More formally, it defines  how  the
              transfer  function  (actual  acceleration as a function of current
              device velocity and acceleration controls) is constructed. This is
              mainly a matter of personal preference.

              0      classic (mostly compatible)
             -1      none (only constant deceleration is applied)
              1      device-dependent
              2      polynomial (polynomial function)
              3      smooth linear (soft knee, then linear)
              4      simple (normal when slow, otherwise accelerated)
              5      power (power function)
              6      linear (more speed, more acceleration)
              7      limited (like linear, but maxes out at threshold)

       Option &quot;ConstantDeceleration&quot;  &quot;real&quot;
              Makes  the  pointer go deceleration times slower than normal. Most
              useful for high-resolution devices.

       Option &quot;AdaptiveDeceleration&quot;  &quot;real&quot;
              Allows to actually decelerate the  pointer  when  going  slow.  At
              most,  it will be adaptive deceleration times slower. Enables pre&#8208;
              cise pointer placement without sacrificing speed.

       Option &quot;AccelerationScheme&quot;  &quot;string&quot;
              Selects the scheme, which is the underlying algorithm.

              predictable   default algorithm (behaving more predictable)
              lightweight   old acceleration code (as specified in the X protocol spec)
              none          no acceleration or deceleration

       Option &quot;AccelerationNumerator&quot;  &quot;integer&quot;

       Option &quot;AccelerationDenominator&quot;  &quot;integer&quot;
              Set numerator and denominator  of  the  acceleration  factor.  The
              acceleration  factor is a rational which, together with threshold,
              can be used to tweak profiles to suit the users needs. The  simple
              and  limited profiles use it directly (i.e. they accelerate by the
              factor), for other profiles it should hold that a higher accelera&#8208;
              tion  factor leads to a faster pointer. Typically, 1 is unacceler&#8208;
              ated and values up to 5 are sensible.

       Option &quot;AccelerationThreshold&quot;  &quot;integer&quot;
              Set the threshold, which is roughly the velocity  (usually  device
              units  per  10  ms) required for acceleration to become effective.
              The precise effect varies with the profile however.


INPUTCLASS SECTION
       The config file may have multiple InputClass  sections.   These  sections
       are  optional  and are used to provide configuration for a class of input
       devices as they are automatically added. An input device can  match  more
       than one InputClass section. Each class can override settings from a pre&#8208;
       vious class, so it is best to arrange the sections with the most  generic
       matches first.
&#12;       InputClass sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;InputClass&quot;
               Identifier  &quot;name&quot;
               entries
               ...
               options
               ...
           EndSection

       The  Identifier  entry is required in all InputClass sections.  All other
       entries are optional.

       The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this input class.  The
       Driver  entry  specifies  the  name  of  the driver to use for this input
       device.  After all classes have been examined, the  &quot;inputdriver&quot;  module
       from  the  first  Driver  entry  will  be enabled when using the loadable
       server.

       When an input device is  automatically  added,  its  characteristics  are
       checked  against  all  InputClass  sections.  Each  section  can  contain
       optional entries to narrow the  match  of  the  class.  If  none  of  the
       optional entries appear, the InputClass section is generic and will match
       any input device. If more than one of these entries appear, they all must
       match for the configuration to apply.

       There  are  two  types  of match entries used in InputClass sections. The
       first allows various tokens to  be  matched  against  attributes  of  the
       device.  An  entry  can be constructed to match attributes from different
       devices by separating arguments with a &apos;|&apos; character. Multiple entries of
       the  same type may be supplied to add multiple matching conditions on the
       same attribute. For example:

           Section &quot;InputClass&quot;
               Identifier   &quot;My Class&quot;
               # product string must contain example and
               # either gizmo or gadget
               MatchProduct &quot;example&quot;
               MatchProduct &quot;gizmo|gadget&quot;
               ...
           EndSection

       MatchProduct  &quot;matchproduct&quot;
              This entry can be used to check if  the  substring  &quot;matchproduct&quot;
              occurs in the device&apos;s product name.

       MatchVendor  &quot;matchvendor&quot;
              This  entry  can  be  used to check if the substring &quot;matchvendor&quot;
              occurs in the device&apos;s vendor name.

       MatchDevicePath &quot;matchdevice&quot;
              This entry can be used to check if the  device  file  matches  the
              &quot;matchdevice&quot; pathname pattern.

       MatchOS &quot;matchos&quot;
              This  entry  can  be used to check if the operating system matches
              the case-insensitive &quot;matchos&quot; string. This  entry  is  only  sup&#8208;
              ported on platforms providing the uname(2) system call.

       MatchPnPID &quot;matchpnp&quot;
              The  device&apos;s  Plug  and  Play (PnP) ID can be checked against the
              &quot;matchpnp&quot; shell wildcard pattern.

       MatchUSBID &quot;matchusb&quot;
              The device&apos;s USB ID can be checked against  the  &quot;matchusb&quot;  shell
              wildcard  pattern.  The ID is constructed as lowercase hexadecimal
              numbers separated by a  &apos;:&apos;.  This  is  the  same  format  as  the
              lsusb(8) program.

       MatchDriver &quot;matchdriver&quot;
              Check  the  case-sensitive  string  &quot;matchdriver&quot; against the cur&#8208;
              rently configured driver of the device. Ordering of sections using
              this  entry is important since it will not match unless the driver
              has been set by the config backend or a previous  InputClass  sec&#8208;
              tion.

       MatchTag &quot;matchtag&quot;
              This  entry  can  be  used to check if tags assigned by the config
              backend matches the &quot;matchtag&quot; pattern. A match  is  found  if  at
              least  one of the tags given in &quot;matchtag&quot; matches at least one of
              the tags assigned by the backend.

       MatchLayout &quot;matchlayout&quot;
              Check the case-sensitive string  &quot;matchlayout&quot;  against  the  cur&#8208;
              rently active ServerLayout section. The empty string &quot;&quot; matches an
              implicit layout which appears if no  named  ServerLayout  sections
              have been found.

       The  second  type  of  entry is used to match device types. These entries
       take a boolean argument similar to Option entries.

       MatchIsKeyboard     &quot;bool&quot;

       MatchIsPointer      &quot;bool&quot;

       MatchIsJoystick     &quot;bool&quot;

       MatchIsTablet       &quot;bool&quot;

       MatchIsTouchpad     &quot;bool&quot;

       MatchIsTouchscreen  &quot;bool&quot;

       When an input device has been matched  to  the  InputClass  section,  any
       Option  entries are applied to the device. One InputClass specific Option
       is recognized. See the InputDevice section above for a description of the
       remaining Option entries.

       Option &quot;Ignore&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies that the device should be ignored
              entirely, and not added to the server. This can be useful when the
              device  is  handled  by  another program and no X events should be
              generated.

DEVICE SECTION
       The config file may have multiple Device  sections.   There  must  be  at
       least one, for the video card being used.

       Device sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;Device&quot;
               Identifier &quot;name&quot;
               Driver     &quot;driver&quot;
               entries
               ...
           EndSection

       The  Identifier  and  Driver entries are required in all Device sections.
       All other entries are optional.

       The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this graphics  device.
       The  Driver entry specifies the name of the driver to use for this graph&#8208;
       ics device.  When using the loadable server, the driver  module  &quot;driver&quot;
       will  be loaded for each active Device section.  A Device section is con&#8208;
       sidered active if it is referenced by an active Screen section.

       Device sections recognise some driver-independent  entries  and  Options,
       which are described here.  Not all drivers make use of these driver-inde&#8208;
       pendent entries, and many of those that do don&apos;t require them to be spec&#8208;
       ified  because  the  information  is  auto-detected.   See the individual
       graphics driver manual pages for further information about this, and  for
       a  description  of  the  device-specific  options.  Note that most of the
       Options listed here (but not the other entries) may be specified  in  the
       Screen section instead of here in the Device section.

       BusID  &quot;bus-id&quot;
              This specifies the bus location of the graphics card.  For PCI/AGP
              cards, the bus-id  string  has  the  form  PCI:bus:device:function
              (e.g.,  &#8220;PCI:1:0:0&#8221;  might  be appropriate for an AGP card).  This
              field is usually optional in single-head configurations when using
              the  primary graphics card.  In multi-head configurations, or when
              using a secondary graphics card in  a  single-head  configuration,
              this entry is mandatory.  Its main purpose is to make an unambigu&#8208;
              ous connection between the device section and the hardware  it  is
              representing.   This  information  can usually be found by running
              the pciaccess tool scanpci.

       Screen  number
              This option is mandatory for cards where a single PCI  entity  can
              drive more than one display (i.e., multiple CRTCs sharing a single
              graphics accelerator and video memory).   One  Device  section  is
              required  for  each head, and this parameter determines which head
              each of the Device sections applies to.  The legal values of  num&#8208;
              ber  range  from  0 to one less than the total number of heads per
              entity.  Most drivers require  that  the  primary  screen  (0)  be
              present.

       Chipset  &quot;chipset&quot;
              This  usually  optional  entry  specifies  the chipset used on the
              graphics board.  In most cases this entry is not required  because
              the drivers will probe the hardware to determine the chipset type.
              Don&apos;t specify it unless the driver-specific  documentation  recom&#8208;
              mends that you do.

       Ramdac  &quot;ramdac-type&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies  the  type  of RAMDAC used on the
              graphics board.  This is only used by a few of the drivers, and in
              most  cases  it is not required because the drivers will probe the
              hardware to determine the RAMDAC type where possible.  Don&apos;t spec&#8208;
              ify  it  unless  the driver-specific documentation recommends that
              you do.

       DacSpeed  speed

       DacSpeed  speed-8 speed-16 speed-24 speed-32
              This optional entry specifies the RAMDAC speed  rating  (which  is
              usually  printed  on the RAMDAC chip).  The speed is in MHz.  When
              one value is given, it applies to  all  framebuffer  pixel  sizes.
              When  multiple  values  are  given,  they apply to the framebuffer
              pixel sizes 8, 16, 24 and 32 respectively.  This is  not  used  by
              many drivers, and only needs to be specified when the speed rating
              of the RAMDAC is different from the defaults built in  to  driver,
              or  when the driver can&apos;t auto-detect the correct defaults.  Don&apos;t
              specify it unless  the  driver-specific  documentation  recommends
              that you do.

       Clocks  clock ...
              specifies  the  pixel that are on your graphics board.  The clocks
              are in MHz, and may be specified as a floating point number.   The
              value  is  stored  internally to the nearest kHz.  The ordering of
              the clocks is important.  It must match the order  in  which  they
              are  selected on the graphics board.  Multiple Clocks lines may be
              specified, and each is concatenated to form the list.  Most  driv&#8208;
              ers  do not use this entry, and it is only required for some older
              boards with non-programmable clocks.   Don&apos;t  specify  this  entry
              unless  the  driver-specific  documentation  explicitly recommends
              that you do.

       ClockChip  &quot;clockchip-type&quot;
              This optional entry is used to specify  the  clock  chip  type  on
              graphics boards which have a programmable clock generator.  Only a
              few Xorg drivers support programmable clock chips.   For  details,
              see the appropriate driver manual page.

       VideoRam  mem
              This  optional  entry  specifies  the  amount of video ram that is
              installed on the graphics board.  This is measured in kBytes.   In
              most cases this is not required because the Xorg server probes the
              graphics board to determine this  quantity.   The  driver-specific
              documentation should indicate when it might be needed.

       BiosBase  baseaddress
              This  optional  entry specifies the base address of the video BIOS
              for the VGA board.  This address is  normally  auto-detected,  and
              should only be specified if the driver-specific documentation rec&#8208;
              ommends it.

       MemBase  baseaddress
              This optional entry specifies the memory base address of a  graph&#8208;
              ics  board&apos;s  linear frame buffer.  This entry is not used by many
              drivers, and it should only be specified  if  the  driver-specific
              documentation recommends it.

       IOBase  baseaddress
              This  optional entry specifies the IO base address.  This entry is
              not used by many drivers, and it should only be specified  if  the
              driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       ChipID  id
              This optional entry specifies a numerical ID representing the chip
              type.  For PCI cards, it is usually the device ID.   This  can  be
              used  to override the auto-detection, but that should only be done
              when the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       ChipRev  rev
              This optional entry specifies the chip revision number.  This  can
              be  used  to  override the auto-detection, but that should only be
              done when the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

       TextClockFreq  freq
              This optional entry specifies the pixel clock  frequency  that  is
              used  for  the  regular  text mode.  The frequency is specified in
              MHz.  This is rarely used.

       Option &quot;ModeDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Enable printing of additional debugging information about modeset&#8208;
              ting to the server log.

       Options
              Option  flags  may  be  specified  in  the Device sections.  These
              include driver-specific options  and  driver-independent  options.
              The  former  are  described  in the driver-specific documentation.
              Some of the latter are described below in the  section  about  the
              Screen section, and they may also be included here.


VIDEOADAPTOR SECTION
       Nobody wants to say how this works.  Maybe nobody knows ...
&#12;
MONITOR SECTION
       The  config  file  may have multiple Monitor sections.  There should nor&#8208;
       mally be at least one, for the monitor being used, but a default configu&#8208;
       ration will be created when one isn&apos;t specified.

       Monitor sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;Monitor&quot;
               Identifier &quot;name&quot;
               entries
               ...
           EndSection

       The only mandatory entry in a Monitor section is the Identifier entry.

       The  Identifier  entry  specifies  the unique name for this monitor.  The
       Monitor section may be used to provide information about  the  specifica&#8208;
       tions of the monitor, monitor-specific Options, and information about the
       video modes to use with the monitor.

       With RandR 1.2-enabled drivers, monitor sections may be tied to  specific
       outputs  of  the video card.  Using the name of the output defined by the
       video driver plus the identifier of a monitor section, one  associates  a
       monitor  section with an output by adding an option to the Device section
       in the following format:

       Option &quot;Monitor-outputname&quot; &quot;monitorsection&quot;

       (for example, Option &quot;Monitor-VGA&quot; &quot;VGA monitor&quot; for a VGA output)

       In the absence of specific association of monitor sections to outputs, if
       a  monitor section is present the server will associate it with an output
       to preserve compatibility for previous single-head configurations.

       Specifying video modes is optional because the server will use the DDC or
       other  information provided by the monitor to automatically configure the
       list of modes available.  When modes are specified explicitly in the Mon&#8208;
       itor  section  (with  the Mode, ModeLine, or UseModes keywords), built-in
       modes with the same names are not included.  Built-in modes with  differ&#8208;
       ent  names  are,  however,  still implicitly included, when they meet the
       requirements of the monitor.

       The entries that may be used in Monitor sections are described below.

       VendorName  &quot;vendor&quot;
              This optional entry specifies the monitor&apos;s manufacturer.

       ModelName  &quot;model&quot;
              This optional entry specifies the monitor&apos;s model.

       HorizSync  horizsync-range
              gives the range(s) of horizontal sync frequencies supported by the
              monitor.   horizsync-range may be a comma separated list of either
              discrete values or ranges of values.  A range  of  values  is  two
              values separated by a dash.  By default the values are in units of
              kHz.  They may be specified in MHz or Hz if MHz or Hz is added  to
              the  end  of  the  line.   The data given here is used by the Xorg
              server to determine if video modes are within  the  specifications
              of the monitor.  This information should be available in the moni&#8208;
              tor&apos;s handbook.  If this entry is  omitted,  a  default  range  of
              28-33kHz is used.

       VertRefresh  vertrefresh-range
              gives  the  range(s)  of vertical refresh frequencies supported by
              the monitor.  vertrefresh-range may be a comma separated  list  of
              either  discrete values or ranges of values.  A range of values is
              two values separated by a dash.  By  default  the  values  are  in
              units of Hz.  They may be specified in MHz or kHz if MHz or kHz is
              added to the end of the line.  The data given here is used by  the
              Xorg  server to determine if video modes are within the specifica&#8208;
              tions of the monitor.  This information should be available in the
              monitor&apos;s  handbook.  If this entry is omitted, a default range of
              43-72Hz is used.

       DisplaySize  width height
              This optional entry gives the width and height, in millimetres, of
              the  picture area of the monitor.  If given this is used to calcu&#8208;
              late the horizontal and vertical pitch (DPI) of the screen.

       Gamma  gamma-value

       Gamma  red-gamma green-gamma blue-gamma
              This is an optional entry that can be used to  specify  the  gamma
              correction  for the monitor.  It may be specified as either a sin&#8208;
              gle value or as three separate RGB values.  The values  should  be
              in the range 0.1 to 10.0, and the default is 1.0.  Not all drivers
              are capable of using this information.

       UseModes  &quot;modesection-id&quot;
              Include the set of modes listed in the Modes section called  mode&#8208;
              section-id.   This  makes all of the modes defined in that section
              available for use by this monitor.

       Mode  &quot;name&quot;
              This is an optional multi-line entry that can be used  to  provide
              definitions  for  video modes for the monitor.  In most cases this
              isn&apos;t necessary because the built-in set of  VESA  standard  modes
              will  be  sufficient.   The  Mode keyword indicates the start of a
              multi-line video mode description.  The mode description is termi&#8208;
              nated  with the EndMode keyword.  The mode description consists of
              the following entries:

              DotClock  clock
                  is the dot (pixel) clock rate to be used for the mode.

              HTimings  hdisp hsyncstart hsyncend htotal
                  specifies the horizontal timings for the mode.

              VTimings  vdisp vsyncstart vsyncend vtotal
                  specifies the vertical timings for the mode.

              Flags  &quot;flag&quot; ...
                  specifies an optional set of mode flags, each of  which  is  a
                  separate  string in double quotes.  &quot;Interlace&quot; indicates that
                  the mode is interlaced.  &quot;DoubleScan&quot; indicates a  mode  where
                  each  scanline  is doubled.  &quot;+HSync&quot; and &quot;-HSync&quot; can be used
                  to select the polarity of  the  HSync  signal.   &quot;+VSync&quot;  and
                  &quot;-VSync&quot;  can be used to select the polarity of the VSync sig&#8208;
                  nal.  &quot;Composite&quot; can be used to  specify  composite  sync  on
                  hardware where this is supported.  Additionally, on some hard&#8208;
                  ware, &quot;+CSync&quot; and &quot;-CSync&quot; may be used to select the  compos&#8208;
                  ite sync polarity.

              HSkew  hskew
                  specifies  the number of pixels (towards the right edge of the
                  screen) by which the display enable signal is  to  be  skewed.
                  Not  all  drivers  use  this  information.   This option might
                  become necessary to override the default value supplied by the
                  server  (if  any).   &#8220;Roving&#8221;  horizontal  lines indicate this
                  value needs to be increased.  If the last few pixels on a scan
                  line  appear  on  the left of the screen, this value should be
                  decreased.

              VScan  vscan
                  specifies the number of times each scanline is painted on  the
                  screen.   Not  all  drivers use this information.  Values less
                  than 1 are treated as 1, which is the default.  Generally, the
                  &quot;DoubleScan&quot; Flag mentioned above doubles this value.

       ModeLine  &quot;name&quot; mode-description
              This  entry  is  a  more compact version of the Mode entry, and it
              also can be used to specify video modes for the monitor.  This  is
              a  single  line  format for specifying video modes.  In most cases
              this isn&apos;t necessary because the built-in  set  of  VESA  standard
              modes will be sufficient.

              The mode-description is in four sections, the first three of which
              are mandatory.  The first is the dot (pixel)  clock.   This  is  a
              single number specifying the pixel clock rate for the mode in MHz.
              The second section is a list of four numbers specifying the  hori&#8208;
              zontal  timings.   These  numbers are the hdisp, hsyncstart, hsyn&#8208;
              cend, and htotal values.  The third section is a list of four num&#8208;
              bers  specifying  the  vertical  timings.   These  numbers are the
              vdisp, vsyncstart, vsyncend, and vtotal values.  The final section
              is  a  list of flags specifying other characteristics of the mode.
              Interlace indicates that the mode is interlaced.  DoubleScan indi&#8208;
              cates  a  mode  where each scanline is doubled.  +HSync and -HSync
              can be used to select the polarity of the  HSync  signal.   +VSync
              and -VSync can be used to select the polarity of the VSync signal.
              Composite can be used to specify composite sync on hardware  where
              this  is  supported.   Additionally,  on some hardware, +CSync and
              -CSync may be used to select the  composite  sync  polarity.   The
              HSkew and VScan options mentioned above in the Mode entry descrip&#8208;
              tion can also be used here.

       Option &quot;DPMS&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This option controls whether the server  should  enable  the  DPMS
              extension for power management for this screen.  The default is to
              enable the extension.

       Option &quot;SyncOnGreen&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This option controls whether the video card should drive the  sync
              signal on the green color pin.  Not all cards support this option,
              and most monitors do not require it.  The default is off.

       Option &quot;Primary&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This optional entry specifies that the monitor should  be  treated
              as the primary monitor. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;PreferredMode&quot; &quot;name&quot;
              This optional entry specifies a mode to be marked as the preferred
              initial mode of the monitor.  (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;Position&quot; &quot;x y&quot;
              This optional entry specifies the position of the  monitor  within
              the X screen.  (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;LeftOf&quot; &quot;output&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies  that the monitor should be posi&#8208;
              tioned to the left of the output (not monitor) of the given  name.
              (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;RightOf&quot; &quot;output&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies  that the monitor should be posi&#8208;
              tioned to the right of the output (not monitor) of the given name.
              (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;Above&quot; &quot;output&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies  that the monitor should be posi&#8208;
              tioned above the output (not monitor) of the given  name.   (RandR
              1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;Below&quot; &quot;output&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies  that the monitor should be posi&#8208;
              tioned below the output (not monitor) of the given  name.   (RandR
              1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;Enable&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This optional entry specifies whether the monitor should be turned
              on at startup.  By default, the server will attempt to enable  all
              connected monitors.  (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;DefaultModes&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This  optional  entry specifies whether the server should add sup&#8208;
              ported default modes to the list of modes offered on this monitor.
              By  default,  the  server  will add default modes; you should only
              disable this if you can guarantee that EDID will be  available  at
              all  times, or if you have added custom modelines which the server
              can use.  (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;MinClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot;
              This optional entry specifies the minimum dot clock, in kHz,  that
              is supported by the monitor.

       Option &quot;MaxClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot;
              This  optional entry specifies the maximum dot clock, in kHz, that
              is supported by the monitor.

       Option &quot;Ignore&quot; &quot;bool&quot;
              This optional entry specifies that the monitor should  be  ignored
              entirely,  and  not reported through RandR.  This is useful if the
              hardware reports the presence of outputs that don&apos;t exist.  (RandR
              1.2-supporting drivers only)

       Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;rotation&quot;
              This  optional  entry  specifies the initial rotation of the given
              monitor.  Valid values for rotation are &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;,
              and &quot;inverted&quot;.  (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)


MODES SECTION
       The  config  file  may have multiple Modes sections, or none.  These sec&#8208;
       tions provide a way of defining sets of video modes independently of  the
       Monitor  sections.  Monitor sections may include the definitions provided
       in these sections by using the UseModes keyword.  In most cases the Modes
       sections  are  not  necessary  because  the built-in set of VESA standard
       modes will be sufficient.

       Modes sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;Modes&quot;
               Identifier &quot;name&quot;
               entries
               ...
           EndSection

       The Identifier entry specifies the unique  name  for  this  set  of  mode
       descriptions.  The other entries permitted in Modes sections are the Mode
       and ModeLine entries that are described above in the Monitor section.

SCREEN SECTION
       The config file may have multiple Screen  sections.   There  must  be  at
       least  one, for the &#8220;screen&#8221; being used.  A &#8220;screen&#8221; represents the bind&#8208;
       ing of a graphics device (Device section) and  a  monitor  (Monitor  sec&#8208;
       tion).  A Screen section is considered &#8220;active&#8221; if it is referenced by an
       active ServerLayout section or by the -screen command  line  option.   If
       neither of those is present, the first Screen section found in the config
       file is considered the active one.

       Screen sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;Screen&quot;
               Identifier &quot;name&quot;
               Device     &quot;devid&quot;
               Monitor    &quot;monid&quot;
               entries
               ...
               SubSection &quot;Display&quot;
                  entries
                  ...
               EndSubSection
               ...
           EndSection

       The  Identifier  and  Device  entries  are  mandatory.   All  others  are
       optional.

       The  Identifier  entry  specifies  the  unique name for this screen.  The
       Screen section provides information specific to the whole screen, includ&#8208;
       ing screen-specific Options.  In multi-head configurations, there will be
       multiple active Screen sections, one for each head.  The  entries  avail&#8208;
       able for this section are:

       Device  &quot;device-id&quot;
              This  mandatory  entry specifies the Device section to be used for
              this screen.  This is what ties a  specific  graphics  card  to  a
              screen.   The device-id must match the Identifier of a Device sec&#8208;
              tion in the config file.

       Monitor  &quot;monitor-id&quot;
              specifies which monitor description is to be used for this screen.
              If  a  Monitor  name  is not specified, a default configuration is
              used.  Currently the default configuration  may  not  function  as
              expected on all platforms.

       VideoAdaptor  &quot;xv-id&quot;
              specifies an optional Xv video adaptor description to be used with
              this screen.

       DefaultDepth  depth
              specifies which color depth the server should use by default.  The
              -depth  command line option can be used to override this.  If nei&#8208;
              ther is specified, the default depth is  driver-specific,  but  in
              most cases is 8.

       DefaultFbBpp  bpp
              specifies  which framebuffer layout to use by default.  The -fbbpp
              command line option can be used to override this.  In  most  cases
              the  driver  will chose the best default value for this.  The only
              case where there is even a choice in this value is for  depth  24,
              where some hardware supports both a packed 24 bit framebuffer lay&#8208;
              out and a sparse 32 bit framebuffer layout.

       Options
              Various Option flags may be specified in the Screen section.  Some
              are driver-specific and are described in the driver documentation.
              Others are driver-independent, and will  eventually  be  described
              here.

       Option &quot;Accel&quot;
              Enables  XAA (X Acceleration Architecture), a mechanism that makes
              video cards&apos; 2D  hardware  acceleration  available  to  the   Xorg
              server.   This option is on by default, but it may be necessary to
              turn it off if there are bugs  in  the  driver.   There  are  many
              options  to disable specific accelerated operations, listed below.
              Note that disabling an operation will have no effect if the opera&#8208;
              tion  is  not  accelerated  (whether due to lack of support in the
              hardware or in the driver).

       Option &quot;InitPrimary&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Use the Int10 module to  initialize  the  primary  graphics  card.
              Normally,  only  secondary  cards  are soft-booted using the Int10
              module, as the primary card has already been  initialized  by  the
              BIOS at boot time.  Default: false.

       Option &quot;NoInt10&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
              Disables  the  Int10  module, a module that uses the int10 call to
              the BIOS of the graphics card to initialize it.  Default: false.

       Option &quot;NoMTRR&quot;
              Disables MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support, a  feature  of
              modern  processors which can improve video performance by a factor
              of up to 2.5.  Some hardware has  buggy  MTRR  support,  and  some
              video  drivers have been known to exhibit problems when MTRR&apos;s are
              used.

       Option &quot;XaaNoCPUToScreenColorExpandFill&quot;
              Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source  pat&#8208;
              terns stored in system memory (using a memory-mapped aperture).

       Option &quot;XaaNoColor8x8PatternFillRect&quot;
              Disables   accelerated  fills  of  a  rectangular  region  with  a
              full-color pattern.

       Option &quot;XaaNoColor8x8PatternFillTrap&quot;
              Disables  accelerated  fills  of  a  trapezoidal  region  with   a
              full-color pattern.

       Option &quot;XaaNoDashedBresenhamLine&quot;
              Disables accelerated dashed Bresenham line draws.

       Option &quot;XaaNoDashedTwoPointLine&quot;
              Disables  accelerated  dashed  line  draws  between  two arbitrary
              points.

       Option &quot;XaaNoImageWriteRect&quot;
              Disables accelerated transfers of full-color rectangular  patterns
              from  system  memory  to video memory (using a memory-mapped aper&#8208;
              ture).

       Option &quot;XaaNoMono8x8PatternFillRect&quot;
              Disables accelerated fills of a rectangular region  with  a  mono&#8208;
              chrome pattern.

       Option &quot;XaaNoMono8x8PatternFillTrap&quot;
              Disables  accelerated  fills  of a trapezoidal region with a mono&#8208;
              chrome pattern.

       Option &quot;XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps&quot;
              Disables accelerated draws into pixmaps stored in offscreen  video
              memory.

       Option &quot;XaaNoPixmapCache&quot;
              Disables caching of patterns in offscreen video memory.

       Option &quot;XaaNoScanlineCPUToScreenColorExpandFill&quot;
              Disables  accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source pat&#8208;
              terns stored in system memory (one scan line at a time).

       Option &quot;XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect&quot;
              Disables accelerated transfers of full-color rectangular  patterns
              from system memory to video memory (one scan line at a time).

       Option &quot;XaaNoScreenToScreenColorExpandFill&quot;
              Disables  accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source pat&#8208;
              terns stored in offscreen video memory.

       Option &quot;XaaNoScreenToScreenCopy&quot;
              Disables accelerated copies of rectangular regions from  one  part
              of video memory to another part of video memory.

       Option &quot;XaaNoSolidBresenhamLine&quot;
              Disables accelerated solid Bresenham line draws.
&#12;       Option &quot;XaaNoSolidFillRect&quot;
              Disables accelerated solid-color fills of rectangles.

       Option &quot;XaaNoSolidFillTrap&quot;
              Disables accelerated solid-color fills of Bresenham trapezoids.

       Option &quot;XaaNoSolidHorVertLine&quot;
              Disables accelerated solid horizontal and vertical line draws.

       Option &quot;XaaNoSolidTwoPointLine&quot;
              Disables  accelerated  solid  line  draws  between  two  arbitrary
              points.

       Each Screen section may optionally contain one or  more  Display  subsec&#8208;
       tions.   Those  subsections  provide  depth/fbbpp  specific configuration
       information, and the one chosen depends on the depth and/or fbbpp that is
       being used for the screen.  The Display subsection format is described in
       the section below.


DISPLAY SUBSECTION
       Each Screen section may have multiple Display subsections.  The  &#8220;active&#8221;
       Display  subsection is the first that matches the depth and/or fbbpp val&#8208;
       ues being used, or failing that, the first that has neither  a  depth  or
       fbbpp value specified.  The Display subsections are optional.  When there
       isn&apos;t one that matches the depth and/or fbbpp values being used, all  the
       parameters that can be specified here fall back to their defaults.

       Display subsections have the following format:

               SubSection &quot;Display&quot;
                   Depth  depth
                   entries
                   ...
               EndSubSection

       Depth  depth
              This  entry  specifies what colour depth the Display subsection is
              to be used for.  This entry is usually specified, but  it  may  be
              omitted  to  create a match-all Display subsection or when wishing
              to match only against the FbBpp parameter.   The  range  of  depth
              values  that are allowed depends on the driver.  Most drivers sup&#8208;
              port 8, 15, 16 and 24.  Some also support 1 and/or 4, and some may
              support  other  values (like 30).  Note: depth means the number of
              bits in a pixel that are actually  used  to  determine  the  pixel
              colour.   32  is not a valid depth value.  Most hardware that uses
              32 bits per pixel only uses 24 of them to hold the colour informa&#8208;
              tion, which means that the colour depth is 24, not 32.

       FbBpp  bpp
              This  entry  specifies the framebuffer format this Display subsec&#8208;
              tion is to be used for.  This entry is only needed when  providing
              depth  24  configurations  that  allow  a  choice between a 24 bpp
              packed framebuffer format and a 32bpp sparse  framebuffer  format.
              In most cases this entry should not be used.

       Weight  red-weight green-weight blue-weight
              This  optional  entry  specifies  the relative RGB weighting to be
              used for a screen is being used at depth 16 for drivers that allow
              multiple  formats.   This  may  also be specified from the command
              line with the -weight option (see Xorg(1)).

       Virtual  xdim ydim
              This optional entry specifies the virtual screen resolution to  be
              used.  xdim must be a multiple of either 8 or 16 for most drivers,
              and a multiple of 32 when running in monochrome mode.   The  given
              value  will  be rounded down if this is not the case.  Video modes
              which are too  large  for  the  specified  virtual  size  will  be
              rejected.   If this entry is not present, the virtual screen reso&#8208;
              lution will be set to accommodate all the valid video modes  given
              in  the  Modes  entry.   Some drivers/hardware combinations do not
              support virtual screens.  Refer to the appropriate driver-specific
              documentation for details.

       ViewPort  x0 y0
              This optional entry sets the upper left corner of the initial dis&#8208;
              play.  This is only relevant when the virtual screen resolution is
              different  from the resolution of the initial video mode.  If this
              entry is not given, then the initial display will be  centered  in
              the virtual display area.

       Modes  &quot;mode-name&quot; ...
              This  optional  entry  specifies  the  list of video modes to use.
              Each mode-name specified must be in double quotes.  They must cor&#8208;
              respond  to those specified or referenced in the appropriate Moni&#8208;
              tor section (including implicitly referenced built-in  VESA  stan&#8208;
              dard  modes).   The  server will delete modes from this list which
              don&apos;t satisfy various requirements.  The first valid mode in  this
              list  will  be  the default display mode for startup.  The list of
              valid modes is converted internally into a circular list.   It  is
              possible  to switch to the next mode with Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus and
              to the previous mode with Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus.  When this  entry
              is  omitted, the valid modes referenced by the appropriate Monitor
              section will be used.  If the Monitor section contains  no  modes,
              then  the  selection will be taken from the built-in VESA standard
              modes.

       Visual  &quot;visual-name&quot;
              This optional entry sets the default root visual type.   This  may
              also  be  specified  from the command line (see the Xserver(1) man
              page).  The visual types available for depth  8  are  (default  is
              PseudoColor):

                  StaticGray
                  GrayScale
                  StaticColor
                  PseudoColor
                  TrueColor
                  DirectColor

              The  visual  type  available  for  the  depths  15,  16 and 24 are
              (default is TrueColor):

                  TrueColor
                  DirectColor

              Not all drivers support DirectColor at these depths.

              The visual types available for the depth 4 are (default is Static&#8208;
              Color):

                  StaticGray
                  GrayScale
                  StaticColor
                  PseudoColor

              The  visual  type  available for the depth 1 (monochrome) is Stat&#8208;
              icGray.

       Black  red green blue
              This optional entry allows the &#8220;black&#8221;  colour  to  be  specified.
              This is only supported at depth 1.  The default is black.

       White  red green blue
              This  optional  entry  allows  the &#8220;white&#8221; colour to be specified.
              This is only supported at depth 1.  The default is white.

       Options
              Option flags may be specified in the Display  subsections.   These
              may   include   driver-specific   options  and  driver-independent
              options.  The former are described in the driver-specific documen&#8208;
              tation.   Some  of  the  latter are described above in the section
              about the Screen section, and they may also be included here.

SERVERLAYOUT SECTION
       The config file may have multiple ServerLayout sections.  A &#8220;server  lay&#8208;
       out&#8221;  represents the binding of one or more screens (Screen sections) and
       one or more input devices (InputDevice sections) to form a complete  con&#8208;
       figuration.  In multi-head configurations, it also specifies the relative
       layout of the heads.  A ServerLayout section is considered &#8220;active&#8221; if it
       is  referenced  by  the  -layout  command  line  option  or  by an Option
       &quot;DefaultServerLayout&quot; entry in the ServerFlags section (the former  takes
       precedence  over  the  latter).  If those options are not used, the first
       ServerLayout section found in the config file is  considered  the  active
       one.   If  no ServerLayout sections are present, the single active screen
       and two active (core) input devices are selected as described in the rel&#8208;
       evant sections above.

       ServerLayout sections have the following format:

           Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
               Identifier   &quot;name&quot;
               Screen       &quot;screen-id&quot;
               ...
               InputDevice  &quot;idev-id&quot;
               ...
               options
               ...
           EndSection

       Each  ServerLayout section must have an Identifier entry and at least one
       Screen entry.

       The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for  this  server  layout.
       The  ServerLayout section provides information specific to the whole ses&#8208;
       sion,  including  session-specific  Options.   The  ServerFlags   options
       (described  above)  may  be  specified here, and ones given here override
       those given in the ServerFlags section.

       The entries that may be used in this section are described here.

       Screen  screen-num &quot;screen-id&quot; position-information
              One of these entries must be given for each screen being used in a
              session.   The  screen-id  field  is  mandatory, and specifies the
              Screen  section  being  referenced.   The  screen-num   field   is
              optional,  and  may  be  used  to  specify  the  screen  number in
              multi-head  configurations.   When  this  field  is  omitted,  the
              screens  will  be  numbered  in the order that they are listed in.
              The numbering starts from 0, and must be consecutive.   The  posi&#8208;
              tion-information  field  describes  the  way  multiple screens are
              positioned.  There are a number of different ways that this infor&#8208;
              mation can be provided:

              x y

              Absolute  x y
                  These  both  specify  that the upper left corner&apos;s coordinates
                  are (x,y).  The Absolute keyword is optional.  Some older ver&#8208;
                  sions  of  XFree86 (4.2 and earlier) don&apos;t recognise the Abso&#8208;
                  lute keyword, so it&apos;s safest to just specify  the  coordinates
                  without it.

              RightOf   &quot;screen-id&quot;

              LeftOf    &quot;screen-id&quot;

              Above     &quot;screen-id&quot;

              Below     &quot;screen-id&quot;

              Relative  &quot;screen-id&quot; x y
                  These  give  the screen&apos;s location relative to another screen.
                  The first four position the screen immediately to  the  right,
                  left,  above  or  below the other screen.  When positioning to
                  the right or left, the top edges are aligned.  When  position&#8208;
                  ing  above or below, the left edges are aligned.  The Relative
                  form specifies the offset of the screen&apos;s origin  (upper  left
                  corner) relative to the origin of another screen.

       InputDevice  &quot;idev-id&quot; &quot;option&quot; ...
              One  of  these entries should be given for each input device being
              used in a session.  Normally at least two are required,  one  each
              for  the core pointer and keyboard devices.  If either of those is
              missing, suitable InputDevice entries are searched for  using  the
              method  described  above  in the INPUTDEVICE section.  The idev-id
              field is mandatory, and specifies the name of the InputDevice sec&#8208;
              tion  being  referenced.  Multiple option fields may be specified,
              each in double quotes.  The options permitted here  are  any  that
              may also be given in the InputDevice sections.  Normally only ses&#8208;
              sion-specific input device options would be used here.   The  most
              commonly used options are:

                  &quot;CorePointer&quot;
                  &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
                  &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot;

              and  the  first  two  should normally be used to indicate the core
              pointer and core keyboard devices respectively.

       Options
              In addition to the following, any option permitted in the  Server&#8208;
              Flags  section  may  also be specified here.  When the same option
              appears in both places, the value given  here  overrides  the  one
              given in the ServerFlags section.

       Option &quot;IsolateDevice&quot;  &quot;bus-id&quot;
              Restrict  device  resets  to  the specified bus-id.  See the BusID
              option (described in DEVICE SECTION, above) for the format of  the
              bus-id parameter.  This option overrides SingleCard, if specified.
              At present, only PCI devices can be isolated in this manner.

       Option &quot;SingleCard&quot;  &quot;boolean&quot;
              As IsolateDevice, except that the bus ID of the  first  device  in
              the layout is used.

       Here is an example of a ServerLayout section for a dual headed configura&#8208;
       tion with two mice:

           Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
               Identifier  &quot;Layout 1&quot;
               Screen      &quot;MGA 1&quot;
               Screen      &quot;MGA 2&quot; RightOf &quot;MGA 1&quot;
               InputDevice &quot;Keyboard 1&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
               InputDevice &quot;Mouse 1&quot;    &quot;CorePointer&quot;
               InputDevice &quot;Mouse 2&quot;    &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot;
               Option      &quot;BlankTime&quot;  &quot;5&quot;
           EndSection

DRI SECTION
       This optional section is used to provide some information for the  Direct
       Rendering  Infrastructure.   Details about the format of this section can
       be found on-line at &lt;http://dri.freedesktop.org/&gt;.

VENDOR SECTION
       The optional Vendor section may be used to provide  vendor-specific  con&#8208;
       figuration  information.   Multiple  Vendor  sections may be present, and
       they may contain an Identifier entry and multiple Option flags.  The data
       therein is not used in this release.
