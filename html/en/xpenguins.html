XPenguins(1)                                                        XPenguins(1)



NAME
       xpenguins - cute little penguins that walk along the tops of your windows

SYNOPSIS
       xpenguins [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       XPenguins  is  a program for animating cute cartoons/animals in your root
       window.  By default it will be penguins - they drop in from  the  top  of
       the screen, walk along the tops of your windows, up the side of your win&#8208;
       dows, levitate, skateboard, and do other similarly  exciting  things.  Be
       careful  when  you  move windows as the little guys squash easily. If you
       send the program an interupt signal (such as by hitting Ctrl-C) they will
       burst.   XPenguins  is  now  themeable, so it is easy to select something
       else to animate instead of penguins, or even (with a little artistic tal&#8208;
       ent) define your own; see the THEMES section below.

OPTIONS
       In  all  the  following  cases  a double dash can be replaced by a single
       dash.

       -a, --no-angels
               Do not show any cherubim flying up to heaven  when  a  toon  gets
               squashed.

       -b, --no-blood
               Do not show any gory death sequences.

       -c dir, --config-dir dir
               Look  for  config files and themes in this directory. The default
               is usually /usr/share/xpenguins.

       -d display, --display display
               Send the toons to the specified X display. In the absence of this
               option, the display specified by the DISPLAY environment variable
               is used.

       -h, --help
               Print out a message describing the available options.


       -i, --theme-info
               Print out the auxiliary  information  about  a  theme  and
               exit. Use the -t option to select the theme to describe.

       --random-theme
               Start with a random theme.

       -l, --list-themes
               List the available themes, one on each line, and exit.

       -m delay, --delay delay
               Set  the  delay  between  each  frame in milliseconds. The
               default is defined by the theme.

       -n number, --penguins number
               The number of toons to start, up to a maximum of 256.  The
               default is defined by the theme.

       -p, --ignorepopups
               Toons  fall  through `popup&apos; windows (those with the save-
               under attribute set), such as  tooltips.  Note  that  this
               also includes the KDE panel.

       -r, --rectwin
               Toons  regard  all  windows  as  rectangular.  This option
               results in faster calculation of window positions, but  if
               you use one of those fancy new window managers with shaped
               windows then your toons might sometimes look like  they&apos;re
               walking on thin air.

       -s, --squish
               Enable  the penguins to be squished using any of the mouse
               buttons. Note that this disables any existing function  of
               the mouse buttons on the root window.

       -t theme, --theme theme
               Use  the  named  theme.  The  default is Penguins.  If the
               theme has spaces in its name then you can use  underscores
               instead,  or  alternatively  just  put  the name in double
               quotes. This option can be called multiple  times  to  run
               several themes simultaneously.

       -q, --quiet
               Suppress the exit message when an interupt is received.

       -v, --version
               Print out the current version number and quit.

       --all   Load all available themes and run them simultaneously.

       --id window
               Send toons to the window with this ID, instead of the root
               window or whichever window is appropriate for the  current
               desktop  environment.  Note  that  the  ID  of  X  clients
               reported by xwininfo is rarely that of the foremost  visi&#8208;
               ble window that should be used here.

       --nice loadaverage1 loadaverage2
               Start  killing  toons  when the 1-min averaged system load
               exceeds loadaverage1; when it  exceeds  loadaverage2  kill
               them  all.  The  toons will reappear when the load average
               comes down. The load is checked every 5 seconds by looking
               in  /proc/loadavg,  so this option only works under unices
               that implement this particular pseudo file (probably  just
               Linux).  When  there are no toons on the screen, XPenguins
               uses only a miniscule amount of CPU time - it  just  wakes
               up every 5 seconds to recheck the load.

THEMES
       The system themes are usually kept in /usr/share/xpenguins/themes,
       and these can be augmented or overridden by the user&apos;s  themes  in
       $HOME/.xpenguins/themes.   Each  theme  has  its  own subdirectory
       which to be valid must contain a file called config.  The name  of
       the  theme is taken from the directory name, although because many
       install scripts choke on directory names  containing  spaces,  all
       spaces  in  a  theme name are represented in the directory name by
       underscores. Any directory name containing spaces is  inaccessible
       by xpenguins.

       In  addition  to the config file, the theme directory contains the
       toon images that make up the theme in the form of xpm image files.
       Additionally,  there  should be an about file which gives informa&#8208;
       tion on the creator of the theme, the license under  which  it  is
       distributed and various other things. This file is principally for
       use by xpenguins_applet, an applet for GNOME that allows different
       themes to be selected at the click of a button.
&#12;       The  config  file has a reasonably straightforward format. You can
       either read this rather terse description of it or you can have  a
       look  at  the config file for the default Penguins theme, which is
       usually installed at  /usr/share/xpenguins/themes/Penguins/config,
       and  is reasonably well commented. We&apos;ll first establish some sim&#8208;
       ple terminology. Say you have  a  Farmyard  theme  with  cows  and
       sheep.  The  cows  and  sheep are types of toon, while the various
       things they get up to (walking,  mooing  and  so  on)  are  termed
       activities.   Each  activity  has its own xpm image file, in which
       the frames of the animation are laid out horizontally. Some activ&#8208;
       ities  (notably  walking)  use  different  images depending on the
       direction the toon is moving in. In this case the frames  for  the
       two directions are laid out one above the other in the image.

       As  in  shell scripts, comments are initiated with the # character
       and hide the remainder of the line. The format  is  entirely  free
       except that there is an arbitrary limit on the length of a line of
       512 characters.  Spaces, tabs and newlines all  count  equally  as
       white space. Data is entered as a sequence of key value pairs, all
       separated by white space. Neither the keys nor the values are case
       sensitive,  except  where  the  value is a filename. The following
       keys are understood:

       delay delay
               Set the recommended delay between frames in milliseconds.

       toon toon
               Begin defining a new toon called toon.  If only  one  type
               of toon is present in the theme then this key may be omit&#8208;
               ted.

       number number
               Set the default number of toons of  the  current  type  to
               start.

       define activity
               Begin  defining an activity for the current toon. The cur&#8208;
               rently understood activities are walker, faller,  tumbler,
               climber,  floater,  runner,  explosion,  squashed, zapped,
               splatted, angel, exit and action?, where  ?  is  a  number
               between  0  and 6.  Once you&apos;ve seen the program in action
               you should be able to guess which is which. A valid  theme
               must  contain at least walkers and fallers.  Additionally,
               you may define a default activity (with  define  default);
               any properties (such as width and speed) set here are then
               adopted by the activities defined from then on, if they do
               not  themselves explicitly define those properties.  After
               an activity has been declared with define,  the  following
               properties may be assigned:

       pixmap xpmfile
               The  file containing the image data for the activity. Note
               that you may not set a default pixmap.

       width width
               The width of each frame of the animation in pixels.

       height height
               The height of each frame of the animation in pixels.

       frames frames
               The number of frames in the animation.

       directions directions
               The number of directions for the activity (can be 1 or 2).
&#12;       speed speed
               The initial speed of the toon when engaged in this  activ&#8208;
               ity, in pixels per frame.

       acceleration acceleration
               The rate at which the speed increases, in pixels per frame
               squared. This property is not utilised by all activities.

       terminal_velocity terminal_velocity
               The maximum speed in pixels per frame, again not  utilised
               by all activities.

       loop loop
               Only  understood  by the actions; indicates how many times
               to repeat the action. If negative, then the  probility  of
               stopping  the  action every time the action is complete is
               -1/loop.

       Some notes regarding the various activities. If you design  a  new
       theme,  feel  free to make the splatted, squashed, zapped and exit
       animations as gory and bloody as you like,  but  please  keep  the
       explosion activity nice and tame; that way those of a nervous dis&#8208;
       position can employ the --no-blood option which replaces all these
       violent deaths with a tasteful explosion that wouldn&apos;t offend your
       grandmother. Xpm images files are a factor of two smaller  if  you
       can  limit  the  number of colours in the image such that only one
       character need be used to represent each colour; this  also  makes
       XPenguins  start  up  much  more  rapidly. Rarely are more than 64
       colours required.

       So that&apos;s about it for the config file, now for  the  about  file.
       This  is  very  simple. Again comments are initialised by a #.  An
       entry consists of a key at the start of a line,  followed  by  the
       corresponding value which is read up to the next newline. The fol&#8208;
       lowing keys are understood, although none are compulsory.

       artist  Used to  list  the  artist(s)  who  created  the  original
               images.

       maintainer
               The  person  who  compiled  the  images  into an XPenguins
               theme. It is useful if an email address can also  be  pro&#8208;
               vided.

       date    The  date  when  the theme was last modified. My preferred
               format is day of the month, name of the month in  english,
               full year.  For example: 24 April 2001.

       icon    The  name of an image file that can be used as an icon for
               the theme; XPM and PNG are suitable formats.

       license The name of the license under which the theme is  distrib&#8208;
               uted (e.g. GPL).

       copyright
               The year and holder of the copyright.

       comment Any  other  essential information, such as the theme&apos;s web
               site, as brief as possible.

               Please test any about files you create by looking  at  how
               the  information is displayed by the xpenguins_applet pro&#8208;
               gram.

       Inspiration provided by Rick Jansen &lt;rick@sara.nl&gt; in the form  of
       the  classic xsnow.  Most penguin images were taken from Pingus, a
       free  lemmings  clone  that   can   be   found   at   &lt;http://pin&#8208;
       gus.seul.org/&gt;;   these   images  were  designed  by  Joel  Fauche

NOTES
       XPenguins can load an X server and/or network  (although  the  CPU
       time used is small), and if a large number of penguins are spawned
       then they may begin to flicker, depending on the speed  of  the  X
       server.

BUGS
       A  new feature since version 2.1 is the ability to draw to windows
       other than the root window in situations where the window  manager
       or  desktop environment places a large window over the root window
       that would otherwise obscure the toons.  Currently  XPenguins  can
       draw  to the KDE Desktop (KDE 2.0 and 2.1), Enlightenment desktops
       greater than 0 (E16), the Nautilus desktop and  the  virtual  root
       window  of certain window managers like amiwm.  Of course, simpler
       window managers that don&apos;t mess around like this will  still  work
       (sawfish,  blackbox and countless others). It cannot work with CDE
       and probably never will. Future versions of KDE, Enlightenment and
       Nautilus  may  not work; the classic symptom of this is that XPen&#8208;
       guins sits there as if it&apos;s doing something, but no toons are vis&#8208;
       ible.  If  this  happens,  try running the program with one of the
       simpler window manager listed above, or visit  the  XPenguins  web
       site  and download the latest version. If there are icons drawn on
       the root window then the toons will erase them when they walk over
       them,  although  an  expose event will be sent to the window every
       100 frames to redraw them.
