NAME
       xpmtoppm - convert an X11 pixmap into a portable pixmap


SYNOPSIS
       xpmtoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [-verbose] [xpmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  an  X11 pixmap (XPM version 1 or 3) as input.  Produces a PPM file
       as output.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              xpmtoppm creates a PBM file containing the transparency  mask  for
              the image.  If the input image doesn&apos;t contain transparency infor&#8208;
              mation, the alpha-filename file contains all white (opaque)  alpha
              values.  If you don&apos;t specify --alphaout, xpmtoppm does not gener&#8208;
              ate an alpha file, and if the input image has transparency  infor&#8208;
              mation, xpmtoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, xpmtoppm writes the alpha output
              to Standard Output and discards the image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       --verbose
              xpmtoppm prints  information  about  its  processing  on  Standard
              Error.


LIMITATIONS
       The  support  to  XPM  version  3 is limited. Comments can only be single
       lines and there must be for every pixel a default colorname for  a  color
       type visual.
