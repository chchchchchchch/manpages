NAME
       xscreensaver-getimage-file  -  put  a randomly-selected image on the root
       window

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver-getimage-file  [-display  host:display.screen]   [--verbose]
       [--name] directory

DESCRIPTION
       The  xscreensaver-getimage-file  program  is  a  helper  program  for the
       xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  Specifically, it  is  invoked
       by xscreensaver-getimage(1) as needed.  This is not a user-level command.

       This  program  selects a random image from disk, and loads it on the root
       window.  It does this by figuring out which  image-loading  programs  are
       installed on the system, and invoking the first one it finds.

OPTIONS
       xscreensaver-getimage-file accepts the following options:

       --verbose
           Print diagnostics.

       --name
           Don&apos;t load an image: instead just print the file name to stdout.

       directory
           The  directory  to  search.    The  directory will be searched recur&#8208;
           sively, and all files in it are assumed to be images.
