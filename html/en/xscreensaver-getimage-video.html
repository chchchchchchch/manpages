NAME
       xscreensaver-getimage-video - put a video frame on the root window

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver-getimage-video  [-display  host:display.screen]  [--verbose]
       [--stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       The xscreensaver-getimage-video program  is  a  helper  program  for  the
       xscreensaver  hacks  that manipulate images.  Specifically, it is invoked
       by xscreensaver-getimage(1) as needed.  This is not a user-level command.

       This program grabs a random frame of video from the system&apos;s video input,
       and then loads it on the root window.  It does this by figuring out which
       frame-grabbing programs are installed on the  system,  and  invoking  the
       first  one it finds.   Then it runs xscreensaver-getimage-file(1) to load
       that image onto the root window.

OPTIONS
       xscreensaver-getimage-video accepts the following options:

       --verbose
           Print diagnostics.

       --stdout
           Instead of loading the image onto the root window, write it to stdout
           as a PBM file.
