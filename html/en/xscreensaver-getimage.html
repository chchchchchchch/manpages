xscreensaver-getimage(1)       XScreenSaver manual      xscreensaver-getimage(1)



NAME
       xscreensaver-getimage - put some randomly-selected image on the root win&#8208;
       dow

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver-getimage [-display host:display.screen] [--verbose]  window-
       id [pixmap-id]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xscreensaver-getimage  program  is a helper program for the xscreen&#8208;
       saver hacks that manipulate images.  This is not a user-level command.

       This program selects a random image, and puts it on the specified  window
       or  pixmap.   This  image  might be a snapshot of the desktop; or a frame
       captured from the system&apos;s video input; or a randomly-selected image from
       disk.

       If  only  a  window ID is specified, the image will be painted there.  If
       both a window ID and a pixmap ID are specified, then the  image  will  be
       painted on the pixmap; and the window may be modified as a side-effect.

OPTIONS
       xscreensaver-getimage  reads  the  ~/.xscreensaver file for configuration
       information.  It uses these settings:

       grabDesktopImages
           Whether it is acceptable to grab snapshots of the desktop.  The secu&#8208;
           rity  paranoid  might  want to turn this off, to avoid letting people
           see (but not touch!) your desktop while the screen is locked.

       grabVideoFrames
           Whether it is acceptable to grab frames of video  from  the  system&apos;s
           video input.  Grabbing of video is done by invoking the xscreensaver-
           getimage-video(1) program.

       chooseRandomImages
           Whether it is acceptable to display  random  images  found  on  disk.
           Selection and loading of images is done by invoking the xscreensaver-
           getimage-file(1) program.

       imageDirectory
           When loading images from disk, this is the directory to find them in.
           The directory will be searched recursively for images.

           It may also be the URL of an RSS or Atom feed, in which case a random
           image from that feed will be selected instead.  The contents  of  the
           feed will be cached locally and refreshed periodically as needed.

       If  none  of the three options are set to True, then video colorbars will
       be displayed instead.

BUGS
       When grabbing desktop images, the window argument will  be  unmapped  and
       have  its contents modified, causing flicker.  (This does not happen when
       loading image files or video frames.)
