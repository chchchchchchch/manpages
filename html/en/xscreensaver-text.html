NAME
       xscreensaver-text - prints some text to stdout, for use by screen savers.

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver-text [--verbose] [--columns N] [--text STRING] [--file PATH]
       [--program CMD] [--url URL]

DESCRIPTION
       The xscreensaver-text script prints out some  text  for  use  by  various
       screensavers,  according  to the options set in the ~/.xscreensaver file.
       This may dump the contents of a file, run a program, or load a URL.

OPTIONS
       xscreensaver-text accepts the following options:

       --columns N or --cols N
               Where to wrap lines; default 72 columns.

       --verbose or -v
               Print diagnostics to stderr.  Multiple -v switches  increase  the
               amount of output.

       Command  line  options  may  be  used  to  override  the  settings in the
       ~/.xscreensaver file:

       --string STRING
               Print the given string.  It may contain % escape sequences as per
               strftime(2).

       --file PATH
               Print  the  contents  of the given file.  If --cols is specified,
               re-wrap the lines; otherwise, print them as-is.

       --program CMD
               Run the given program and print its output.  If --cols is  speci&#8208;
               fied, re-wrap the output.

       --url HTTP-URL
               Download and print the contents of the HTTP document.  If it con&#8208;
               tains HTML, RSS, or Atom, it will be converted to plain-text.

               Note: this re-downloads the document every time it  is  run!   It
               might be considered abusive for you to point this at a web server
               that you do not control!

ENVIRONMENT
       HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy
           to get the default HTTP proxy host and port.

BUGS
       The RSS and Atom output is always ISO-8859-1, regardless of locale.

       URLs should be cached, use &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot;, and obey &quot;Expires&quot;.
