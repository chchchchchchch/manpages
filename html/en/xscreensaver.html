xscreensaver(1)                XScreenSaver manual               xscreensaver(1)



NAME
       xscreensaver - extensible screen saver framework, plus locking

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver   [-display   host:display.screen]  [-verbose]  [-no-splash]
       [-no-capture-stderr] [-log filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard  and  mouse  have  been
       idle  for  a  period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It
       turns off as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.

       This program can lock your terminal in order to prevent others from using
       it, though its default mode of operation is merely to display pretty pic&#8208;
       tures on your screen when it is not in use.

       It also provides configuration and control of your monitor&apos;s power-saving
       features.

GETTING STARTED
       For the impatient, try this:
       xscreensaver &amp;
       xscreensaver-demo
       The  xscreensaver-demo(1) program pops up a dialog box that lets you con&#8208;
       figure the screen saver, and experiment with the various display modes.

       Note that xscreensaver has a client-server model: the  xscreensaver  pro&#8208;
       gram  is  a  daemon  that runs in the background; it is controlled by the
       foreground xscreensaver-demo(1) and xscreensaver-command(1) programs.

CONFIGURATION
       The easiest way to configure xscreensaver is to simply run  the  xscreen&#8208;
       saver-demo(1) program, and change the settings through the GUI.  The rest
       of this manual page describes lower level ways of changing settings.

       I&apos;ll repeat that because it&apos;s important:

           The easy way to configure xscreensaver is to  run  the  xscreensaver-
           demo(1)  program.   You  shouldn&apos;t  need  to  know  any  of the stuff
           described in this manual  unless  you  are  trying  to  do  something
           tricky, like customize xscreensaver for site-wide use or something.

       Options  to  xscreensaver are stored in one of two places: in a .xscreen&#8208;
       saver file in your home directory; or in the X resource database.  If the
       .xscreensaver  file  exists,  it  overrides  any settings in the resource
       database.

       The syntax of the .xscreensaver file is similar to that of the .Xdefaults
       file; for example, to set the timeout paramter in the .xscreensaver file,
       you would write the following:
       timeout: 5
       whereas, in the .Xdefaults file, you would write
       xscreensaver.timeout: 5
       If you change a setting in the .xscreensaver file while  xscreensaver  is
       already  running,  it  will  notice this, and reload the file.  (The file
       will be reloaded the next time  the  screen  saver  needs  to  take  some
       action,  such  as  blanking  or  unblanking  the screen, or picking a new
       graphics mode.)

       If you change a setting in your X  resource  database,  or  if  you  want
       xscreensaver  to notice your changes immediately instead of the next time
       it wakes up, then you will need to reload your .Xdefaults file, and  then
       tell the running xscreensaver process to restart itself, like so:
       xrdb &lt; ~/.Xdefaults
       xscreensaver-command -restart
       If  you want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your edits to the
       xscreensaver app-defaults file, which should  have  been  installed  when
       xscreensaver itself was installed.  The app-defaults file will usually be
       named /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver, but different systems might
       keep   it  in  a  different  place  (for  example,  /usr/openwin/lib/app-
       defaults/XScreenSaver on Solaris.)

       When settings are changed in the Preferences dialog box (see  above)  the
       current  settings  will be written to the .xscreensaver file.  (The .Xde&#8208;
       faults file and the app-defaults file will never be written  by  xscreen&#8208;
       saver itself.)

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       xscreensaver also accepts a few command-line options, mostly for use when
       debugging: for normal operation, you  should  configure  things  via  the
       ~/.xscreensaver file.

       -display host:display.screen
               The  X  display  to  use.   For  displays  with multiple screens,
               XScreenSaver will manage all screens  on  the  display  simultan&#8208;
               iously.

       -verbose
               Same  as  setting the verbose resource to true: print diagnostics
               on stderr and on the xscreensaver window.

       -no-capture-stderr
               Do not redirect the stdout and stderr streams to the xscreensaver
               window itself.  If xscreensaver is crashing, you might need to do
               this in order to see the error message.

       -log filename
               This is exactly the same as redirecting stdout and stderr to  the
               given file (for append).  This is useful when reporting bugs.

HOW IT WORKS
       When  it  is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen black window
       is created on each screen of the display.  Each window is created in such
       a  way that, to any subsequently-created programs, it will appear to be a
       &quot;virtual root&quot; window.  Because of this, any program which draws  on  the
       root  window  (and  which  understands  virtual  roots)  can be used as a
       screensaver.  The various graphics demos are, in  fact,  just  standalone
       programs that know how to draw on the provided window.

       When the user becomes active again, the screensaver windows are unmapped,
       and the running subprocesses are killed by sending them SIGTERM.  This is
       also  how  the  subprocesses are killed when the screensaver decides that
       it&apos;s time to run a different demo: the old one is killed and a new one is
       launched.

       You  can  control  a  running  screensaver  process by using the xscreen&#8208;
       saver-command(1) program (which see.)

POWER MANAGEMENT
       Modern X servers contain support to power down the monitor after an  idle
       period.   If  the monitor has powered down, then xscreensaver will notice
       this (after a few minutes), and will not waste CPU  by  drawing  graphics
       demos  on  a  black  screen.   An attempt will also be made to explicitly
       power the monitor back up as soon as user activity is detected.

       The ~/.xscreensaver file controls the  configuration  of  your  display&apos;s
       power  management settings: if you have used xset(1) to change your power
       management settings, then xscreensaver will override those  changes  with
       the  values  specified in ~/.xscreensaver (or with its built-in defaults,
       if there is no ~/.xscreensaver file yet.)

       To change your power management settings,  run  xscreensaver-demo(1)  and
       change the various timeouts through the user interface.  Alternately, you
       can edit the ~/.xscreensaver file directly.

       If the power management section is grayed out in the xscreensaver-demo(1)
       window,   then  that  means that your X server does not support the XDPMS
       extension, and so control over the monitor&apos;s power state  is  not  avail&#8208;
       able.

       If  you&apos;re  using  a laptop, don&apos;t be surprised if changing the DPMS set&#8208;
       tings has no effect: many  laptops  have  monitor  power-saving  behavior
       built  in  at  a very low level that is invisible to Unix and X.  On such
       systems, you can typically adjust the power-saving delays only by  chang&#8208;
       ing settings in the BIOS in some hardware-specific way.

       If DPMS seems not to be working with XFree86, make sure the &quot;DPMS&quot; option
       is set in your /etc/X11/XF86Config file.  See  the  XF86Config(5)  manual
       for details.

USING GNOME
       For  the  better  part of a decade, GNOME shipped xscreensaver as-is, and
       everything just worked out of the box.  In 2005, however, they decided to
       re-invent  the  wheel and ship their own replacement for the xscreensaver
       daemon called &quot;gnome-screensaver&quot;, rather than improving xscreensaver and
       contributing  their  changes  back.  As a result, the &quot;gnome-screensaver&quot;
       program is insecure, bug-ridden, and missing many  features  of  xscreen&#8208;
       saver.  You shouldn&apos;t use it.

       To replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver:

           1: Turn off gnome-screensaver.
              Open  the  &quot;System  / Preferences / Screensaver&quot; panel and uncheck
              both boxes.

           2: Stop gnome-screensaver from launching at login.
              Run the command:

              gconftool-2 --type boolean -s \
              /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/screensaver/start_screensaver \
              false

              Or, just uninstall the &quot;gnome-screensaver&quot; package entirely.

           3: Launch xscreensaver at login.
              Open the &quot;System / Preferences  /  Sessions  /  Startup  Programs&quot;
              panel.  Click &quot;Add&quot; and type &quot;xscreensaver&quot;.

           4: Tell Preferences to use the xscreensaver configurator.
              Edit /usr/share/applications/gnome-screensaver-preferences.desktop
              and change the Exec= line to say
                  Exec=xscreensaver-demo

           5: Make &quot;System / Quit / Lock Screen&quot; use xscreensaver.
              Run the command:
              sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
                          /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command

USING KDE
       Like GNOME, KDE also decided to invent their own screen  saver  framework
       from  scratch  instead  of simply using xscreensaver.  To replace the KDE
       screen saver with xscreensaver, do the following:

           1: Turn off KDE&apos;s screen saver.
              Open the &quot;Control Center&quot; and select the &quot;Appearance  &amp;  Themes  /
              Screensaver&quot; page.  Un-check &quot;Start Automatically&quot;.

           2: Find your Autostart directory.
              Open  the  &quot;System Administration / Paths&quot; page, and see what your
              &quot;Autostart path&quot; is set to: it will probably be  ~/.kde/Autostart/
              or something similar.

           3: Make xscreensaver be an Autostart program.
              Create a .desktop file in your autostart directory called xscreen&#8208;
              saver.desktop that contains the following five lines:

              [Desktop Entry]
              Exec=xscreensaver
              Name=XScreenSaver
              Type=Application
              X-KDE-StartupNotify=false

           4: Make the various &quot;lock session&quot; buttons call xscreensaver.
              The file you want to replace next has moved around over the years.
              It might be called /usr/libexec/kde4/kscreenlocker, or it might be
              called &quot;kdesktop_lock&quot; or  &quot;krunner_lock&quot;,  and  it  might  be  in
              /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/   or   in   /usr/kde/3.5/bin/  or  even  in
              /usr/bin/, depending on the distro and phase of the moon.  Replace
              the contents of that file with these two lines:

              #!/bin/sh
              xscreensaver-command -lock

              Make sure the file is executable (chmod a+x).

       Now use xscreensaver normally, controlling it via the usual xscreensaver-
       demo(1) and xscreensaver-command(1) mechanisms.

USING GDM
       You can run xscreensaver from your gdm(1) session, so  that  the  screen&#8208;
       saver will run even when nobody is logged in on the console.  To do this,
       run gdmconfig(1) and on the Background page, type the  command  &quot;xscreen&#8208;
       saver  -nosplash&quot; into the Background Program field.  That will cause gdm
       to run xscreensaver while nobody is logged in, and kill  it  as  soon  as
       someone  does  log  in.   (The user will then be responsible for starting
       xscreensaver on their own, if they want.)

       Another  way  to  accomplish  the  same  thing  is  to  edit   the   file
       /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf to include:
       BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver -nosplash
       RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true
       In  this  situation, the xscreensaver process will probably be running as
       user gdm instead of root.   You  can  configure  the  settings  for  this
       nobody-logged-in   state   (timeouts,   DPMS,   etc.)   by   editing  the
       ~gdm/.xscreensaver file.

       To get gdm to run the BackgroundProgram, you may need to switch  it  from
       the &quot;Graphical Greeter&quot; to the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot;.

       It is safe to run xscreensaver as root (as xdm or gdm may do.)  If run as
       root, xscreensaver changes its effective user and group ids to  something
       safe (like &quot;nobody&quot;) before connecting to the X server or launching user-
       specified programs.

       An unfortunate side effect of this  (important)  security  precaution  is
       that it may conflict with cookie-based authentication.

       If  you  get  &quot;connection  refused&quot; errors when running xscreensaver from
       gdm, then this probably means that you have xauth(1) or some other  secu&#8208;
       rity  mechanism turned on.  For information on the X server&apos;s access con&#8208;
       trol mechanisms, see the man pages for X(1), Xsecurity(1), xauth(1),  and
       xhost(1).

BUGS
       Bugs?   There are no bugs.  Ok, well, maybe.  If you find one, please let
       me know.  http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html explains how to  con&#8208;
       struct the most useful bug reports.

       Locking and root logins
           In  order  for  it to be safe for xscreensaver to be launched by xdm,
           certain precautions had to be taken,  among  them  that  xscreensaver
           never runs as root.  In particular, if it is launched as root (as xdm
           is likely to do),  xscreensaver  will  disavow  its  privileges,  and
           switch itself to a safe user id (such as nobody.)

           An  implication of this is that if you log in as root on the console,
           xscreensaver will refuse to lock the screen (because  it  can&apos;t  tell
           the  difference  between  root  being logged in on the console, and a
           normal user being logged in on the console  but  xscreensaver  having
           been launched by the xdm(1) Xsetup file.)

           The  solution  to  this is simple: you shouldn&apos;t be logging in on the
           console as root in the first place!  (What, are you  crazy  or  some&#8208;
           thing?)

           Proper  Unix hygiene dictates that you should log in as yourself, and
           su(1) to root as necessary.  People who spend their day logged in  as
           root are just begging for disaster.

       XAUTH and XDM
           For  xscreensaver to work when launched by xdm(1) or gdm(1), programs
           running on the local machine as user &quot;nobody&quot; must be able to connect
           to  the X server.  This means that if you want to run xscreensaver on
           the console while nobody is  logged  in,  you  may  need  to  disable
           cookie-based  access  control  (and allow all users who can log in to
           the local machine to connect to the display.)

           You should be sure that this is an acceptable thing  to  do  in  your
           environment before doing it.  See the &quot;Using GDM&quot; section, above, for
           more details.

       Passwords
           If you get an error message at startup like &quot;couldn&apos;t get password of
           user&quot;  then  this probably means that you&apos;re on a system in which the
           getpwent(3) library routine can only be effectively used by root.  If
           this  is  the  case, then xscreensaver must be installed as setuid to
           root in order for locking to work.  Care has been taken to make  this
           a safe thing to do.

           It  also  may  mean that your system uses shadow passwords instead of
           the standard getpwent(3) interface; in that case,  you  may  need  to
           change some options with configure and recompile.

           If  you change your password after xscreensaver has been launched, it
           will continue using your old password  to  unlock  the  screen  until
           xscreensaver  is restarted.  On some systems, it may accept both your
           old and new passwords.  So, after you change  your  password,  you&apos;ll
           have to do
           xscreensaver-command -restart
           to make xscreensaver notice.

       PAM Passwords
           If  your  system uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), then in
           order for xscreensaver to use PAM properly, PAM must  be  told  about
           xscreensaver.   The  xscreensaver  installation process should update
           the PAM data (on Linux, by creating the file  /etc/pam.d/xscreensaver
           for  you,  and  on  Solaris,  by telling you what lines to add to the
           /etc/pam.conf file.)

           If the PAM configuration files do not know about  xscreensaver,  then
           you  might  be  in a situation where xscreensaver will refuse to ever
           unlock the screen.

           This is a design flaw in PAM (there is no way for a  client  to  tell
           the  difference  between  PAM  responding &quot;I have never heard of your
           module&quot;, and responding, &quot;you typed the wrong password&quot;.)  As far  as
           I  can  tell,  there is no way for xscreensaver to automatically work
           around this, or detect the problem in advance, so if  you  have  PAM,
           make sure it is configured correctly!

       Machine Load
           Although this program &quot;nices&quot; the subprocesses that it starts, graph&#8208;
           ics-intensive subprograms can still overload the machine  by  causing
           the  X  server  process itself (which is not &quot;niced&quot;) to consume many
           cycles.  Care has been taken in all the modules shipped with xscreen&#8208;
           saver  to  sleep  periodically,  and  not run full tilt, so as not to
           cause appreciable load.

           However, if you are running  the  OpenGL-based  screen  savers  on  a
           machine  that  does  not have a video card with 3D acceleration, they
           will make your machine slow, despite nice(1).

           Your options are: don&apos;t use the OpenGL display modes; or, collect the
           spare  change  hidden under the cushions of your couch, and use it to
           buy a video card manufactured after 1998.  (It doesn&apos;t even  need  to
           be  fast  3D  hardware:  the problem will be fixed if there is any 3D
           hardware at all.)

       XFree86&apos;s Magic Keystrokes
           The XFree86 X server traps certain  magic  keystrokes  before  client
           programs ever see them.  Two that are of note are Ctrl+Alt+Backspace,
           which causes the X server to exit; and  Ctrl+Alt+Fn,  which  switches
           virtual consoles.  The X server will respond to these keystrokes even
           if xscreensaver has the screen locked.  Depending on your setup,  you
           might consider this a problem.

           Unfortunately,  there  is  no way for xscreensaver itself to override
           the  interpretation  of  these  keys.   If  you   want   to   disable
           Ctrl+Alt+Backspace globally, you need to set the DontZap flag in your
           /etc/X11/XF86Config file.  To globally disable VT switching, you  can
           set the DontVTSwitch flag.  See the XF86Config(5) manual for details.

X RESOURCES
       These  are the X resources use by the xscreensaver program.  You probably
       won&apos;t need to change these manually (that&apos;s what the xscreensaver-demo(1)
       program is for).

       timeout (class Time)
               The  screensaver  will activate (blank the screen) after the key&#8208;
               board and mouse have been idle for this many minutes.  Default 10
               minutes.

       cycle (class Time)
               After the screensaver has been running for this many minutes, the
               currently running graphics-hack sub-process will be killed  (with
               SIGTERM), and a new one started.  If this is 0, then the graphics
               hack will never be changed: only one  demo  will  run  until  the
               screensaver is deactivated by user activity.  Default 10 minutes.

       lock (class Boolean)
               Enable  locking:  before  the  screensaver will turn off, it will
               require you to type the password of the logged-in  user  (really,
               the  person  who ran xscreensaver), or the root password.  (Note:
               this doesn&apos;t work  if  the  screensaver  is  launched  by  xdm(1)
               because it can&apos;t know the user-id of the logged-in user.  See the
               &quot;Using XDM(1)&quot; section, below.

       lockTimeout (class Time)
               If locking is enabled, this controls the  length  of  the  &quot;grace
               period&quot;  between  when  the  screensaver  activates, and when the
               screen becomes locked.  For example, if this is 5,  and  -timeout
               is  10,  then after 10 minutes, the screen would blank.  If there
               was user activity at 12 minutes, no password would be required to
               un-blank  the screen.  But, if there was user activity at 15 min&#8208;
               utes or later (that is, -lock-timeout minutes  after  activation)
               then  a  password  would  be required.  The default is 0, meaning
               that if locking is enabled, then a password will be  required  as
               soon as the screen blanks.

       passwdTimeout (class Time)
               If  the screen is locked, then this is how many seconds the pass&#8208;
               word dialog box should be left on the  screen  before  giving  up
               (default 30 seconds.)  This should not be too large: the X server
               is grabbed for the duration that the password dialog  box  is  up
               (for  security  purposes)  and leaving the server grabbed for too
               long can cause problems.

       dpmsEnabled (class Boolean)
               Whether power management is enabled.

       dpmsStandby (class Time)
               If power management is enabled, how long until the  monitor  goes
               solid black.

       dpmsSuspend (class Time)
               If  power  management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes
               into power-saving mode.

       dpmsOff (class Time)
               If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor powers
               down  completely.   Note  that these settings will have no effect
               unless both the X server and the display hardware  support  power
               management; not all do.  See the Power Management section, below,
               for more information.

       dpmsQuickOff (class Boolean)
               If mode is blank and this is true, then the screen will  be  pow&#8208;
               ered  down  immediately upon blanking, regardless of other power-
               management settings.

       visualID (class VisualID)
               Specify which X visual to use by default.  (Note  carefully  that
               this  resource  is called visualID, not merely visual; if you set
               the visual resource instead, things will malfunction  in  obscure
               ways for obscure reasons.)

               Legal values for the VisualID resource are:

               default Use  the  screen&apos;s default visual (the visual of the root
                       window.)  This is the default.

               best    Use the visual which supports  the  most  colors.   Note,
                       however,  that the visual with the most colors might be a
                       TrueColor visual, which does not support colormap  anima&#8208;
                       tion.   Some programs have more interesting behavior when
                       run on PseudoColor visuals than on TrueColor.

               mono    Use a monochrome visual, if there is one.

               gray    Use a grayscale or staticgray visual, if there is one and
                       it  has  more  than  one  plane  (that is, it&apos;s not mono&#8208;
                       chrome.)

               color   Use the best of the color visuals, if there are any.

               GL      Use the visual that is best for OpenGL programs.  (OpenGL
                       programs  have somewhat different requirements than other
                       X programs.)

               class   where class is one of StaticGray, StaticColor, TrueColor,
                       GrayScale,  PseudoColor,  or  DirectColor.   Selects  the
                       deepest visual of the given class.

               number  where number (decimal or hex) is interpreted as a  visual
                       id  number,  as  reported  by the xdpyinfo(1) program; in
                       this way you can have finer control  over  exactly  which
                       visual  gets used, for example, to select a shallower one
                       than would otherwise have been chosen.

               Note that this option specifies only the default visual that will
               be  used:  the visual used may be overridden on a program-by-pro&#8208;
               gram basis.  See the description of the programs resource, below.

       installColormap (class Boolean)
               On PseudoColor (8-bit) displays, install a private colormap while
               the  screensaver is active, so that the graphics hacks can get as
               many colors as  possible.   This  is  the  default.   (This  only
               applies  when  the  screen&apos;s  default visual is being used, since
               non-default visuals get their own colormaps automatically.)  This
               can also be overridden on a per-hack basis: see the discussion of
               the default-n name in the section about the programs resource.

               This does nothing if you have a TrueColor (16-bit or deeper) dis&#8208;
               play.

       verbose (class Boolean)
               Whether to print diagnostics.  Default false.

       timestamp (class Boolean)
               Whether  to print the time of day along with any other diagnostic
               messages.  Default true.

       splash (class Boolean)
               Whether to display a splash screen at startup.  Default true.

       splashDuration (class Time)
               How long the splash screen should remain visible; default 5  sec&#8208;
               onds.

       helpURL (class URL)
               The splash screen has a Help button on it.  When you press it, it
               will display the web page indicated here in your web browser.

       loadURL (class LoadURL)
               This is the shell command used  to  load  a  URL  into  your  web
               browser.   The default setting will load it into Mozilla/Netscape
               if it is already running, otherwise, will launch  a  new  browser
               looking at the helpURL.

       demoCommand (class DemoCommand)
               This  is the shell command run when the Demo button on the splash
               window is pressed.  It defaults to xscreensaver-demo(1).

       prefsCommand (class PrefsCommand)
               This is the shell command run when the Prefs button on the splash
               window is pressed.  It defaults to xscreensaver-demo -prefs.

       newLoginCommand (class NewLoginCommand)
               If  set,  this  is  the  shell  command that is run when the &quot;New
               Login&quot; button is pressed on the unlock dialog box,  in  order  to
               create a new desktop session without logging out the user who has
               locked the screen.  Typically this will be some variant  of  gdm&#8208;
               flexiserver(1) or kdmctl(1).

       nice (class Nice)
               The sub-processes created by xscreensaver will be &quot;niced&quot; to this
               level, so that they are given lower priority than other processes
               on  the  system,  and don&apos;t increase the load unnecessarily.  The
               default is 10.  (Higher numbers mean lower priority; see  nice(1)
               for details.)

       fade (class Boolean)
               If this is true, then when the screensaver activates, the current
               contents of the screen will fade to black instead of simply wink&#8208;
               ing  out.   This only works on certain systems.  A fade will also
               be done when switching  graphics  hacks  (when  the  cycle  timer
               expires.)  Default: true.

       unfade (class Boolean)
               If this is true, then when the screensaver deactivates, the orig&#8208;
               inal contents of the screen will fade in from  black  instead  of
               appearing  immediately.   This only works on certain systems, and
               if fade is true as well.  Default false.

       fadeSeconds (class Time)
               If fade is true, this is how long the fade  will  be  in  seconds
               (default 3 seconds.)

       fadeTicks (class Integer)
               If  fade  is  true,  this is how many times a second the colormap
               will be changed to effect a fade.  Higher numbers yield  smoother
               fades,  but  may  make  the  fades take longer than the specified
               fadeSeconds if your server isn&apos;t fast enough to keep up.  Default
               20.

       captureStderr (class Boolean)
               Whether  xscreensaver  should  redirect  its  stdout  and  stderr
               streams to the window itself.  Since its nature is to  take  over
               the  screen,  you would not normally see error messages generated
               by xscreensaver or the sub-programs it runs; this  resource  will
               cause  the  output  of  all  relevant programs to be drawn on the
               screensaver window itself, as well as being written to  the  con&#8208;
               trolling  terminal  of  the  screensaver driver process.  Default
               true.

       ignoreUninstalledPrograms (class Boolean)
               There may be programs in the list that are not installed  on  the
               system, yet are marked as &quot;enabled.&quot;  If this preference is true,
               then such programs will simply be  ignored.   If  false,  then  a
               warning will be printed if an attempt is made to run the nonexis&#8208;
               tent program.  Also, the xscreensaver-demo(1) program  will  sup&#8208;
               press  the  non-existent  programs from the list if this is true.
               Default: false.

       GetViewPortIsFullOfLies (class Boolean)
               Set this to true if the xscreensaver  window  doesn&apos;t  cover  the
               whole screen.  This works around a longstanding XFree86 bug #421.
               See the xscreensaver FAQ for details.

       font (class Font)
               The font used for the stdout/stderr  text,  if  captureStderr  is
               true.   Default  *-medium-r-*-140-*-m-*  (a  14 point fixed-width
               font.)

       mode (class Mode)
               Controls the behavior of xscreensaver.  Legal values are:

               random  When blanking the screen, select a  random  display  mode
                       from  among  those that are enabled and applicable.  This
                       is the default.

               random-same
                       Like random, but if  there  are  multiple  screens,  each
                       screen  will run the same random display mode, instead of
                       each screen running a different one.

               one     When blanking the screen, only ever  use  one  particular
                       display mode (the one indicated by the selected setting.)

               blank   When  blanking  the  screen, just go black: don&apos;t run any
                       graphics hacks.

               off     Don&apos;t ever blank the screen, and  don&apos;t  ever  allow  the
                       monitor to power down.
&#12;       selected (class Integer)
               When  mode is set to one, this is the one, indicated by its index
               in the programs list.  You&apos;re crazy if you  count  them  and  set
               this number by hand: let xscreensaver-demo(1) do it for you!

       programs (class Programs)
               The graphics hacks which xscreensaver runs when the user is idle.
               The value of this resource is a multi-line string, one  sh-syntax
               command per line.  Each line must contain exactly one command: no
               semicolons, no ampersands.

               When the screensaver starts up, one of these is selected (accord&#8208;
               ing  to  the  mode  setting),  and  run.   After the cycle period
               expires, it is killed, and another is selected and run.

               If a line begins with a dash (-) then that particular program  is
               disabled:  it  won&apos;t  be selected at random (though you can still
               select it explicitly using the xscreensaver-demo(1) program.)

               If all programs are disabled, then the screen will just  be  made
               blank, as when mode is set to blank.

               To  disable  a  program, you must mark it as disabled with a dash
               instead of removing it from the list.  This is because  the  sys&#8208;
               tem-wide (app-defaults) and per-user (.xscreensaver) settings are
               merged together, and if a user just deletes an entry  from  their
               programs  list,  but  that  entry still exists in the system-wide
               list, then it will come back.  However, if the user disables  it,
               then their setting takes precedence.

               If  the  display  has  multiple screens, then a different program
               will be run for  each  screen.   (All  screens  are  blanked  and
               unblanked simultaneously.)

               Note that you must escape the newlines; here is an example of how
               you might set this in your ~/.xscreensaver file:

               programs:  \
                      qix -root                          \n\
                      ico -r -faces -sleep 1 -obj ico    \n\
                      xdaliclock -builtin2 -root         \n\
                      xv -root -rmode 5 image.gif -quit  \n
               Make sure your $PATH environment variable  is  set  up  correctly
               before  xscreensaver is launched, or it won&apos;t be able to find the
               programs listed in the programs resource.

               To use a program as a screensaver, two things are required:  that
               that program draw on the root window (or be able to be configured
               to draw on the root window); and  that  that  program  understand
               &quot;virtual  root&quot;  windows, as used by virtual window managers such
               as tvtwm(1).  (Generally, this is accomplished by just  including
               the &quot;vroot.h&quot; header file in the program&apos;s source.)

               Visuals:

               Because  xscreensaver  was created back when dinosaurs roamed the
               earth, it still contains support for some things you&apos;ve  probably
               never  seen,  such  as 1-bit monochrome monitors, grayscale moni&#8208;
               tors, and monitors capable of displaying only  8-bit  colormapped
               images.

               If there are some programs that you want to run only when using a
               color display, and others that you want to run only when using  a
               monochrome display, you can specify that like this:
                      mono:   mono-program  -root        \n\
                      color:  color-program -root        \n\
               More generally, you can specify the kind of visual that should be
               used for the window on which the program will  be  drawing.   For
               example,  if  one  program  works  best if it has a colormap, but
               another works best if it has a 24-bit visual, both can be  accom&#8208;
               modated:
                      PseudoColor: cmap-program  -root   \n\
                      TrueColor:   24bit-program -root   \n\
               In  addition to the symbolic visual names described above (in the
               discussion of the visualID resource) one  other  visual  name  is
               supported in the programs list:

                default-n
                    This  is  like  default,  but  also  requests the use of the
                    default colormap, instead of a private colormap.  (That  is,
                    it  behaves  as  if  the -no-install command-line option was
                    specified, but only for this particular hack.)  This is pro&#8208;
                    vided  because  some  third-party  programs that draw on the
                    root window (notably: xv(1), and xearth(1)) make assumptions
                    about  the  visual  and colormap of the root window: assump&#8208;
                    tions which xscreensaver can violate.

               If you specify a particular visual for a program, and that visual
               does  not exist on the screen, then that program will not be cho&#8208;
               sen to run.  This means that on displays with multiple screens of
               different depths, you can arrange for appropriate hacks to be run
               on each.  For example, if one screen is color and  the  other  is
               monochrome,  hacks  that look good in mono can be run on one, and
               hacks that only look good in color will show up on the other.

       You shouldn&apos;t ever need to change the following resources:

       pointerPollTime (class Time)
               When server extensions are not in use,  this  controls  how  fre&#8208;
               quently  xscreensaver checks to see if the mouse position or but&#8208;
               tons have changed.  Default 5 seconds.

       pointerHysteresis (class Integer)
               If the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second, ignore
               it  (do not consider that to be &quot;activity.&quot;)  This is so that the
               screen doesn&apos;t un-blank (or  fail  to  blank)  just  because  you
               bumped the desk.  Default: 10 pixels.

       windowCreationTimeout (class Time)
               When  server  extensions  are not in use, this controls the delay
               between when windows are created and  when  xscreensaver  selects
               events on them.  Default 30 seconds.

       initialDelay (class Time)
               When  server  extensions  are  not in use, xscreensaver will wait
               this many seconds before selecting events  on  existing  windows,
               under  the  assumption  that  xscreensaver is started during your
               login procedure, and the window state may be in flux.  Default 0.
               (This  used  to default to 30, but that was back in the days when
               slow machines and X terminals were more common...)

       procInterrupts (class Boolean)
               This resource controls whether the /proc/interrupts  file  should
               be  consulted  to  decide  whether the user is idle.  This is the
               default if xscreensaver has been compiled on a system which  sup&#8208;
               ports this mechanism (i.e., Linux systems.)

               The  benefit to doing this is that xscreensaver can note that the
               user is active even when the X console is not the active one:  if
               the  user is typing in another virtual console, xscreensaver will
               notice that and will fail to activate.  For  example,  if  you&apos;re
               playing Quake in VGA-mode, xscreensaver won&apos;t wake up in the mid&#8208;
               dle of your game and start competing for CPU.

               The drawback to doing this is that perhaps  you  really  do  want
               idleness on the X console to cause the X display to lock, even if
               there is activity on other virtual consoles.  If you  want  that,
               then set this option to False.  (Or just lock the X console manu&#8208;
               ally.)
&#12;               The default value for this resource is True, on systems where  it
               works.

       overlayStderr (class Boolean)
               If  captureStderr  is  True,  and  your server supports &quot;overlay&quot;
               visuals, then the text will be written into  one  of  the  higher
               layers  instead of into the same layer as the running screenhack.
               Set this to False to disable that (though you shouldn&apos;t need to.)

       overlayTextForeground (class Foreground)
               The foreground color used for the  stdout/stderr  text,  if  cap&#8208;
               tureStderr is true.  Default: Yellow.

       overlayTextBackground (class Background)
               The  background  color  used  for the stdout/stderr text, if cap&#8208;
               tureStderr is true.  Default: Black.

       bourneShell (class BourneShell)
               The pathname of the shell that xscreensaver uses to start subpro&#8208;
               cesses.   This must be whatever your local variant of /bin/sh is:
               in particular, it must not be csh.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number,  and  to  inform  the
               sub-programs of the screen on which to draw.

       XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW
               Passed  to sub-programs to indicate the ID of the window on which
               they should draw.  This is necessary  on  Xinerama/RANDR  systems
               where multiple physical monitors share a single X11 &quot;Screen&quot;.

       PATH    to find the sub-programs to run.

       HOME    for the directory in which to read the .xscreensaver file.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to  get  the  name  of  a resource file that overrides the global
               resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
