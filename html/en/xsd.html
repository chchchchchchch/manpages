xsd(1)                                                                    xsd(1)



NAME
       xsd - Mono&apos;s utility for generating schema or class files

SYNOPSIS
       xsd &lt;schema.xsd&gt; /classes [options]

       xsd &lt;schema.xsd&gt; /dataset [options]

       xsd &lt;assembly&gt;.dll|&lt;assembly&gt;.exe [options]

       xsd &lt;instance.xml&gt; [&lt;instance.xml&gt; ...] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       xsd is a tool for intended to complement the XML serialization support of
       Mono. It can do the following tasks:

       Generate serializable classes
              From a given XML schema, generate a class that can be used to read
              and  write  xml  documents  that  conform  that  schema  (/classes
              option).

       Generate typed datasets
              From a given XML schema, generate a typed DataSet class  that  can
              be  used  to read and write xml documents that conform that schema
              (/dataset option).

       Generate XML schemas
              From a given assembly and an optional type name, generate  an  XML
              schema  that can be used to validate the xml documents that can be
              obtained by serializing objects of that type. If no type  is  pro&#8208;
              vided,  xsd generates a schema for all types in the assembly. When
              specifying the assembly name do not  include  the  file  extension
              (.dll  or .exe). xsd will look for the assembly using the standard
              assembly loading rules.

       Infer XML schemas
              From a given set of XML documents, infer the XML schema  that  can
              be used to validate those documents.


OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       /element:name /e:name
              Specifies  the name of the XML schema element for which a class or
              a dataset has to be generated.


       /namespace:name /n:name
              Specifies the namespace of the XML schema element for which
              a class or a dataset has to be generated.

       /language:name /l:name
              Specifies the programming language to use for the generated
              code. The only supported languages are CS (C#) and VB (Vis&#8208;
              ual Basic.NET).

       /generator:type,assembly /g:type,assembly
              Indicates xsd.exe to use custom CodeDomProvider to generate
              code. The type name must be full name. Assembly name  is  a
              local  file  name that is going to be loaded. The specified
              Type must have the default constructor.

       /outputdir:path /o:path
              Specifies the directory  where  to  generate  the  code  or
              schemas.

       /type:name /t:name
              Specifies  the  full name of the type (including namespace)
              for which to generate the XML schema.

       /help /h
              Show usage help.
