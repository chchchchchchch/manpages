DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is used to set various user preference options of the dis&#8208;
       play.

OPTIONS
       -display display
               This option specifies the server to use; see X(7).

       b       The b option controls bell  volume,  pitch  and  duration.   This
               option  accepts  up  to  three  numerical parameters, a preceding
               dash(-), or a &apos;on/off&apos; flag.  If no parameters are given, or  the
               &apos;on&apos; flag is used, the system defaults will be used.  If the dash
               or &apos;off&apos; are given, the bell will be turned  off.   If  only  one
               numerical parameter is given, the bell volume will be set to that
               value, as a percentage of  its  maximum.   Likewise,  the  second
               numerical  parameter  specifies the bell pitch, in hertz, and the
               third numerical parameter specifies the duration in milliseconds.
               Note  that  not  all  hardware can vary the bell characteristics.
               The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as  closely
               as it can to the user&apos;s specifications.

       bc      The  bc  option controls bug compatibility mode in the server, if
               possible; a preceding dash(-) disables the  mode,  otherwise  the
               mode  is  enabled.  Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal values in
               some protocol requests, and pre-R4 servers did not correctly gen&#8208;
               erate  errors  in these cases.  Such clients, when run against an
               R4 server, will terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to operate
               correctly.   Bug  compatibility mode explicitly reintroduces cer&#8208;
               tain bugs into the X server, so that many such clients can  still
               be  run.   This  mode  should  be used with care; new application
               development should be done with this mode disabled.   The  server
               must  support  the  MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD  protocol extension in
               order for this option to work.

       c       The c option  controls  key  click.   This  option  can  take  an
               optional  value, a preceding dash(-), or an &apos;on/off&apos; flag.  If no
               parameter or the &apos;on&apos; flag is given, the system defaults will  be
               used.  If  the  dash or &apos;off&apos; flag is used, keyclick will be dis&#8208;
               abled.  If a value from 0 to 100 is given, it is used to indicate
               volume,  as  a  percentage of the maximum.  The X server will set
               the volume to the nearest value that the hardware can support.

       -dpms   The -dpms option disables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       +dpms   The +dpms option enables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       dpms flags...
               The dpms option allows the DPMS (Energy Star)  parameters  to  be
               set.   The  option  can take up to three numerical values, or the
               `force&apos; flag followed by a DPMS state.  The `force&apos; flags  forces
               the  server  to  immediately  switch to the DPMS state specified.
               The DPMS state can be one  of  `standby&apos;,  `suspend&apos;,  `off&apos;,  or
               `on&apos;.   When  numerical values are given, they set the inactivity
               period (in units of seconds) before the  three  modes  are  acti&#8208;
               vated.  The first value given is for the `standby&apos; mode, the sec&#8208;
               ond is for the `suspend&apos; mode, and the third  is  for  the  `off&apos;
               mode.  Setting these values implicitly enables the DPMS features.
               A value of zero disables a particular mode.

       fp= path,...
               The fp= sets the font path to the entries given in the path argu&#8208;
               ment.   The  entries  are  interpreted  by the server, not by the
               client.  Typically they are directory names or font server names,
               but the interpretation is server-dependent.

       fp default
               The  default  argument  causes  the  font path to be reset to the
               server&apos;s default.

       fp rehash
               The rehash argument resets the font path to  its  current  value,
               causing  the  server  to reread the font databases in the current
               font path.  This is generally only used when adding new fonts  to
               a  font  directory  (after running mkfontdir to recreate the font
               database).

       -fp or fp-
               The -fp and fp- options remove elements  from  the  current  font
               path.   They  must  be  followed  by  a  comma-separated  list of
               entries.

       +fp or fp+
               This +fp and fp+ options prepend and append elements to the  cur&#8208;
               rent  font path, respectively.  They must be followed by a comma-
               separated list of entries.

       led     The led option controls the keyboard  LEDs.   This  controls  the
               turning  on  or  off  of  one  or all of the LEDs.  It accepts an
               optional integer, a preceding dash(-) or an &apos;on/off&apos; flag.  If no
               parameter  or the &apos;on&apos; flag is given, all LEDs are turned on.  If
               a preceding dash or the flag &apos;off&apos; is given, all LEDs are  turned
               off.   If  a  value  between  1 and 32 is given, that LED will be
               turned on or off depending on the existence of a preceding  dash.
               ``xset  led 3&apos;&apos; would turn led #3 on.  ``xset -led 3&apos;&apos; would turn
               it off.  The particular LED values may refer to different LEDs on
               different hardware.  If the X server supports the XKEYBOARD (XKB)
               extension, leds may be referenced by the XKB  indicator  name  by
               specifying  the  `named&apos;  keyword  and  the indicator name.   For
               example, to turn on the Scroll Lock LED:

               xset led named &quot;Scroll Lock&quot;

       mouse   The m option controls the mouse parameters; it may be abbreviated
               to  &apos;m&apos;. Of course, it applies to most pointing devices, not just
               mice. The parameters for the pointing device  are  `acceleration&apos;
               and `threshold&apos;. The acceleration can be specified as an integer,
               or as a simple fraction. Threshold is just an integer.  The  set&#8208;
               ting  is  applied  to  all  connected pointing devices. xinput(1)
               should be used if you need device-specific settings.

       By default the pointer (the  on-screen  representation  of  the  pointing
       device) will go `acceleration&apos; times as fast when the device travels more
       than `threshold&apos; mickeys (i.e. would-be pixels) in  10  ms,  including  a
       small  transition  range.  This  way, the pointing device can be used for
       precise alignment when it is moved slowly, yet it can be  set  to  travel
       across  the  screen  in  a  flick of the wrist when desired.  One or both
       parameters for the m option can be omitted, but if only one is given,  it
       will  be  interpreted  as the acceleration.  If no parameters or the flag
       &apos;default&apos; is used, the system defaults will be set.

       If the `threshold&apos; parameter is provided and 0, the `acceleration&apos; param&#8208;
       eter  will  be used in the exponent of a more natural and continuous for&#8208;
       mula, giving precise control for slow  motion  but  big  reach  for  fast
       motion, and a progressive transition for motions in between.  Recommended
       `acceleration&apos; value in this case is 3/2 to 3, but not  limited  to  that
       range.

       In  the  X.org  X Server 1.6 and above, the behaviour described so far is
       linked to the default profile. There are other profiles  (i.e.  functions
       determining  pointer  acceleration  from  device velocity) and additional
       settings, so the above description may not apply to non-default cases. In
       the X.org Server 1.7, these are available as input device properties (see
       xinput).


       p       The p option controls pixel color values.  The parameters are the
               color  map  entry  number  in decimal, and a color specification.
               The root background colors may be  changed  on  some  servers  by
               altering  the  entries  for  BlackPixel and WhitePixel.  Although
               these are often 0 and 1, they need not be.  Also,  a  server  may
               choose to allocate those colors privately, in which case an error
               will be generated.  The map entry must not be a read-only  color,
               or an error will result.

       r       The  r  option  controls  the autorepeat.  Invoking with &quot;-r&quot;, or
               &quot;r off&quot;, will disable autorepeat, whereas  &quot;r&quot;,  or  &quot;r on&quot;  will
               enable  autorepeat.   Following  the  &quot;-r&quot;  or &quot;r&quot; option with an
               integer keycode between 0 and 255 will disable or enable  autore&#8208;
               peat on that key respectively, but only if it makes sense for the
               particular keycode.  Keycodes below 8 are not typically valid for
               this  command.  Example: &quot;xset -r 10&quot; will disable autorepeat for
               the &quot;1&quot; key on the top row of an IBM PC keyboard.

               If the server supports the XFree86-Misc  extension,  or  the  XKB
               extension,  then  a parameter of &apos;rate&apos; is accepted and should be
               followed by zero, one or two numeric values. The first  specifies
               the  delay  before autorepeat starts and the second specifies the
               repeat rate.  In the case that the server supports the XKB exten&#8208;
               sion,  the  delay is the number of milliseconds before autorepeat
               starts, and the rate is the number of repeats per second.  If the
               rate or delay is not given, it will be set to the default value.

       s       The  s  option  lets  you  set the screen saver parameters.  This
               option accepts up to two numerical parameters, a  &apos;blank/noblank&apos;
               flag,  an  &apos;expose/noexpose&apos;  flag,  an  &apos;on/off&apos; flag, an &apos;acti&#8208;
               vate/reset&apos; flag, or the &apos;default&apos; flag.  If no parameters or the
               &apos;default&apos;  flag  is  used,  the system will be set to its default
               screen saver characteristics.  The &apos;on/off&apos; flags simply turn the
               screen  saver  functions  on  or off.  The &apos;activate&apos; flag forces
               activation of screen saver even if  the  screen  saver  had  been
               turned off.  The &apos;reset&apos; flag forces deactivation of screen saver
               if it is active.  The &apos;blank&apos; flag sets the preference  to  blank
               the video (if the hardware can do so) rather than display a back&#8208;
               ground pattern, while &apos;noblank&apos; sets the preference to display  a
               pattern  rather than blank the video.  The &apos;expose&apos; flag sets the
               preference to allow window exposures (the server can freely  dis&#8208;
               card  window  contents),  while &apos;noexpose&apos; sets the preference to
               disable screen saver unless the server can regenerate the screens
               without  causing  exposure events.  The length and period parame&#8208;
               ters for the screen saver function determines how long the server
               must be inactive for screen saving to activate, and the period to
               change the background pattern to avoid burn  in.   The  arguments
               are  specified  in  seconds.   If only one numerical parameter is
               given, it will be used for the length.

       q       The q option gives you information on the current settings.

       These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

       Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor all of  these
       options.
