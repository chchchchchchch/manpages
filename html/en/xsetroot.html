XSETROOT(1)                                                          XSETROOT(1)



NAME
       xsetroot - root window parameter setting utility for X

SYNOPSIS
       xsetroot  [-help] [-def] [-display display] [-cursor cursorfile maskfile]
       [-cursor_name cursorname] [-xcf cursorfile cursorsize] [-bitmap filename]
       [-mod  x  y] [-gray] [-grey] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-rv] [-solid color]
       [-name string]

DESCRIPTION
       The xsetroot program allows you to tailor the  appearance  of  the  back&#8208;
       ground (&quot;root&quot;) window on a workstation display running X.  Normally, you
       experiment with xsetroot until you find  a  personalized  look  that  you
       like,  then put the xsetroot command that produces it into your X startup
       file.  If no options are specified, or if -def is specified,  the  window
       is  reset  to  its default state.  The -def option can be specified along
       with other options and only the  non-specified  characteristics  will  be
       reset to the default state.

       Only  one of the background color/tiling changing options (-solid, -gray,
       -grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be specified at a time.

OPTIONS
       The various options are as follows:

       -help  Print a usage message and exit.

       -def   Reset unspecified attributes to the default values.  (Restores the
              background  to the familiar gray mesh and the cursor to the hollow
              x shape.)

       -cursor cursorfile maskfile
              This lets you change the pointer cursor to whatever you want  when
              the  pointer  cursor  is  outside  of any window.  Cursor and mask
              files are bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with the bit&#8208;
              map(1)  program.   You probably want the mask file to be all black
              until you get used to the way masks work.

       -cursor_name cursorname
              This lets you change the pointer cursor to  one  of  the  standard
              cursors from the cursor font.  Refer to appendix B of the X proto&#8208;
              col for the names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided  for  this
              option).

       -xcf cursorfile cursorsize
              This  lets  you  change  the  pointer cursor to one loaded from an
              Xcursor file as defined by libXcursor, at the specified size.

       -bitmap filename
              Use the bitmap specified in the file to set  the  window  pattern.
              You  can  make  your  own bitmap files (little pictures) using the
              bitmap(1) program.  The entire  background  will  be  made  up  of
              repeated &quot;tiles&quot; of the bitmap.

       -mod x y
              This is used if you want a plaid-like grid pattern on your screen.
              x and y are integers ranging from 1 to 16.  Try the different com&#8208;
              binations.  Zero and negative numbers are taken as 1.

       -gray  Make the entire background gray.  (Easier on the eyes.)

       -grey  Make the entire background grey.
&#12;       -fg color
              Use  ``color&apos;&apos; as the foreground color.  Foreground and background
              colors are meaningful only in combination with  -cursor,  -bitmap,
              or -mod.

       -bg color
              Use ``color&apos;&apos; as the background color.

       -rv    This exchanges the foreground and background colors.  Normally the
              foreground color is black and the background color is white.

       -solid color
              This sets the background of  the  root  window  to  the  specified
              color.  This option is only useful on color servers.

       -name string
              Set  the  name  of  the  root  window  to ``string&apos;&apos;.  There is no
              default value.  Usually a name is assigned to a window so that the
              window  manager  can  use a text representation when the window is
              iconified.  This option is unused  since  you  can&apos;t  iconify  the
              background.

       -display display
              Specifies the server to connect to; see X(7).
