xsetwacom(1)                                                        xsetwacom(1)



NAME
       xsetwacom  -  commandline  utility  to query and modify wacom driver set&#8208;
       tings.

SYNOPSIS
       xsetwacom [options] [command [arguments]]


DESCRIPTION
       This program queries or changes properties on the devices loaded  by  the
       wacom  driver.  The  modification of properties happens at runtime and is
       not persistent through X server restarts.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -d, --display display_name
              Connect to the X server specified in display_name; see X(7).

       -h, --help
              Prints a short help.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output, useful for debugging.

       -V, --version
              Display version number and exit.


COMMANDS
       Allowed commands are list, get, and set.  The command  may  be  specified
       with  or  without one or two preceding dashes, i.e.  --list is equivalent
       to -list and list.


   LIST COMMANDS
       list devices
              List known devices. Only input devices managed by the wacom driver
              are listed.

       list parameters
              List known parameters. List all parameters suitable for the get or
              the set command. Note that not all parameters are available on all
              device types.

       list modifiers
              List  the  available list of modifiers to be used when setting key
              or button actions.


   GET COMMANDS
       get device_name parameter
              Get the current settings for the parameter on  the  given  device.
              Note  that  not  all parameters are available on all device types.
              The special parameter name &quot;all&quot; may be provided  to  display  all
              current settings on the device.

       By default, options are printed on the commandline in the respective for&#8208;
       mat.
              The output format  may  be  altered  with  one  of  the  following
              options:

       -s, --shell
              Display  the  output  in  shell  format, i.e. as shell commands to
              xsetwacom to reproduce the same parameter.

       -x, --xconf
              Display the output in xorg.conf format, i.e. as option lines  that
              may be added to the InputDevice section in the xorg.conf.


   SET COMMANDS
       set device_name parameter [value]
              Set the parameter value on the given device to the value provided.
              Note that not all parameters are writable, some are read-only  and
              result in an error when trying to be modified.


PARAMETERS
       Not  all parameters are available on all tools.  Use the get command with
       the parameter or &quot;all&quot;  parameter  for  specific  input  tool  applicable
       parameters and current settings.

       Area x1 y1 x2 y2
              Set  the  tablet  input area in device coordinates in the form top
              left x/y and bottom right x/y.  Top  left  and  bottom  right  are
              defined  in  the  device&apos;s  native  orientation, regardless of the
              actual rotation currently applied. Input outside of these  coordi&#8208;
              nates  will be clipped to the edges of the area defined.  Default:
              0 0 x2 y2; with x2 and y2 tablet specific.

       Button button-number [mapping]
              Set a mapping for the specified button-number. Mappings  take  the
              form  of  either a single numeric button or an &apos;action&apos; to be per&#8208;
              formed.  If  no  mapping  is  provided,  the  default  mapping  is
              restored.

              Numeric  button mappings indicate what X11 button number the given
              button-number should correspond to. For example, a mapping of  &quot;3&quot;
              means  a  press of the given button-number will produce as a press
              of X11 button 3 (i.e. right click).

              Action mappings allow button presses to perform many events.  They
              take  the form of a string of keywords and arguments. For example,
              &quot;key +a +shift b -shift -a&quot; converts the button into a  series  of
              keystrokes,  in  this  example  &quot;press  a,  press shift, press and
              release b, release shift, release a&quot;. In  addition  to  the  &quot;key&quot;
              keyword,  &quot;button&quot;  and &quot;modetoggle&quot; are also recognized. Multiple
              keywords may be present in one action if desired: for example &quot;key
              +ctrl button 5 key -ctrl&quot;.

       BindToSerial [serial|0]
              Bind the device to the tool with the specified serial number. Once
              bound, the device will ignore events from other tools. A serial of
              0  means  the  device is unbound and will react to any tool of the
              matching type.  Default: 0

       MapToOutput [output]
              Map the tablet&apos;s input area to a given output (e.g. &quot;VGA1&quot;).  Out&#8208;
              put  names  may either be the name of a head available through the
              XRandR extension, or an X11 geometry string of  the  form  WIDTHx&#8208;
              HEIGHT+X+Y.  To  switch  to  the next available output, the &quot;next&quot;
              keyword is also supported. This will cycle between the  individual
              monitors connected to the system, and then the entire desktop. The
              mapping may be reset to the entire desktop at any  time  with  the
              output  name  &quot;desktop&quot;.  Users of the NVIDIA binary driver should
              use the output names &quot;HEAD-0&quot; and &quot;HEAD-1&quot; until the  driver  sup&#8208;
              ports XRandR 1.2 or later.

              The output mapping configuration is a onetime setting and does not
              track output reconfigurations; the  command  needs  to  be  re-run
              whenever  the  output configuration changes. When used with tablet
              rotation, the tablet must be rotated before it is  mapped  to  the
              new screen. This parameter is write-only and cannot be queried.

       Mode Absolute|Relative
              Set the device mode as either Relative or Absolute. Relative means
              pointer tracking for  the  device  will  function  like  a  mouse,
              whereas  Absolute  means  the  pointer corresponds to the device&apos;s
              actual position on the  tablet  or  tablet  PC  screen.   Default:
              Absolute for stylus, eraser and tablet PC touch; Relative for cur&#8208;
              sor and tablet touch.

       PressureCurve x1 y1 x2 y2
              A Bezier curve of third order, composed of two anchor points  (0,0
              and  100,100)  and  two user modifiable control points that define
              the curve&apos;s shape.  Raise the curve (x1&lt;y1 x2&lt;y2) to &quot;soften&quot;  the
              feel  and lower the curve (x1&gt;y1 x2&gt;y2) for a &quot;firmer&quot; feel.  Sig&#8208;
              moid shaped curves are permitted (x1&gt;y1  x2&lt;y2  or  x1&lt;y1  x2&gt;y2).
              Default:   0  0 100 100, a linear curve; range of 0 to 100 for all
              four values.

       RawSample level
              Set the sample window size (a sliding average sampling window) for
              incoming  input  tool raw data points.  Default:  4, range of 1 to
              20.

       Rotate none|half|cw|ccw
              Set the tablet to the given rotation:
                none: the tablet is not rotated and uses its natural rotation
                half: the tablet is rotated by 180 degrees (upside-down)
                cw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees clockwise
                ccw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise

              Rotation is a tablet-wide option: rotation of one tool affects all
              other  tools  associated  with the same tablet. When the tablet is
              physically rotated, rotate any tool to the corresponding  orienta&#8208;
              tion.  Default:  none

       Suppress level
              Set  the delta (difference) cutoff level for further processing of
              incoming input tool coordinate values.  For example a X or Y coor&#8208;
              dinate event will be sent only if the change between the current X
              or Y coordinate and the previous one is greater than the  Suppress
              value.  The same applies to pressure level (Z coordinate) and Tilt
              rotation values.  With a current absolute wheel (AbsWheel) or Tilt
              value the delta between it and the previous value must be equal to
              or greater than the Suppress value in order to be sent  on.   Sup&#8208;
              press is a tablet wide parameter.  A specified delta level for one
              input tool is applied to all input tool coordinates.   To  disable
              suppression use a level of 0.  Default:  2, range of 0 to 100.

       TabletDebugLevel level
              Set  the debug level for this tablet to the given level. This only
              affects code paths that are shared between several  tools  on  the
              same physical tablet. A higher level means more fine-grained debug
              messages, a level of 0 turns debugging off for this tool. Requires
              the  driver to be built with debugging enabled. See also ToolDebu&#8208;
              gLevel.  Default:  0, range of 0 to 12.

       TabletPCButton on|off
              If on, the stylus must be in contact with the screen for a  stylus
              side  button  to  work.  If off, stylus buttons will work once the
              stylus is in proximity of the tablet (regardless of whether it  is
              touching  the  screen).   Default:  on for Tablet PCs; off for all
              other models.

       ToolSerialPrevious
              Get the serial number of the tool that was last in proximity last.
              This  serial number is updated whenever the tool goes out of prox&#8208;
              imity. If the current tool went out of proximity once, this serial
              number is the one of the current tool. This is a read-only parame&#8208;
              ter.

       CursorProximity distance
              sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting  movement  for
              cursor  in  relative  mode.  Default  for Intuos series is 10, for
              Graphire series (including Volitos) is 42. Only available for  the
              cursor/puck device.

       Threshold level
              Set  the minimum pressure necessary to generate a Button event for
              the stylus tip, eraser, or touch.   The  pressure  levels  of  all
              tablets  are  normalized to 2048 levels irregardless of the actual
              hardware supported levels.  This parameter is independent  of  the
              PressureCurve parameter.  Default:  27, range of 0 to 2047.

       ToolDebugLevel level
              Set  the  debug  level for this tool to the given level. This only
              affects code paths that are specific to a  given  tool.  A  higher
              level  means  more fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0 turns
              debugging off for this tool. Requires the driver to be built  with
              debugging  enabled. See also TabletDebugLevel.  Default:  0, range
              of 0 to 12.
