NAME
       xstdcmap - X standard colormap utility

SYNOPSIS
       xstdcmap  [-all]  [-best] [-blue] [-default] [-delete map] [-display dis&#8208;
       play] [-gray] [-green] [-help] [-red] [-verbose]

DESCRIPTION
       The xstdcmap utility can be used to selectively define standard  colormap
       properties.   It  is intended to be run from a user&apos;s X startup script to
       create standard colormap definitions in order to  facilitate  sharing  of
       scarce  colormap  resources  among  clients.  Where at all possible, col&#8208;
       ormaps are created with read-only allocations.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with xstdcmap:

       -all    This option indicates that all six standard  colormap  properties
               should be defined on each screen of the display.  Not all screens
               will support visuals under which all six standard colormap  prop&#8208;
               erties  are meaningful.  xstdcmap will determine the best alloca&#8208;
               tions and visuals for the colormap properties of  a  screen.  Any
               previously   existing   standard   colormap  properties  will  be
               replaced.

       -best   This option indicates that the RGB_BEST_MAP should be defined.

       -blue   This option indicates that the RGB_BLUE_MAP should be defined.

       -default
               This option indicates that the RGB_DEFAULT_MAP should be defined.

       -delete map
               This option specifies that a specific standard colormap property,
               or  all  such  properties, should be removed.  map may be one of:
               default, best, red, green, blue, gray, or all.

       -display display
               This option specifies the host and display to use; see X(7).

       -gray   This option indicates that the RGB_GRAY_MAP should be defined.

       -green  This option indicates that the RGB_GREEN_MAP should be defined.

       -help   This option indicates that a brief  description  of  the  command
               line  arguments  should  be  printed on the standard error.  This
               will be done whenever an unhandled argument is given to xstdcmap.

       -red    This option indicates that the RGB_RED_MAP should be defined.

       -verbose
               This option indicates that xstdcmap should print logging informa&#8208;
               tion  as  it  parses  its input and defines the standard colormap
               properties.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get default host and display number.
