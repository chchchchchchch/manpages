XTE(1)                                                                    XTE(1)



NAME
       xte - Generates fake input using the XTest extension

SYNOPSIS
       xte [options] commands...

DESCRIPTION
       xte  is  a  program  that generates fake input using the XTest extension,
       more reliable than xse.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -x display
              Send commands to remote X server. Note that some commands may  not
              work correctly unless the display is on the console, e.g. the dis&#8208;
              play is currently controlled by the keyboard and mouse and not  in
              the  background. This seems to be a limitation of the XTest exten&#8208;
              sion.
