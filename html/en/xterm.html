XTERM(1)                                                                XTERM(1)



NAME
       xterm - terminal emulator for X

SYNOPSIS
       xterm [-toolkitoption ...] [-option ...] [shell]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xterm  program  is  a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It
       provides DEC VT102/VT220 (VTxxx) and Tektronix 4014 compatible  terminals
       for programs that cannot use the window system directly.  If the underly&#8208;
       ing operating system supports terminal resizing capabilities  (for  exam&#8208;
       ple,  the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use
       the facilities to notify programs running in the window  whenever  it  is
       resized.

       The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that
       you can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other  at  the  same
       time.   To  maintain  the  correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix
       graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014&apos;s aspect ratio
       that  will fit in the window.  This box is located in the upper left area
       of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of  them  is
       considered  the &#8220;active&#8221; window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
       output.  This is the window that contains the text  cursor.   The  active
       window  can  be chosen through escape sequences, the &#8220;VT Options&#8221; menu in
       the VTxxx window, and the &#8220;Tek Options&#8221; menu in the 4014 window.

EMULATIONS
       The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support  autorepeat.
       Double-size  characters  are  displayed properly if your font server sup&#8208;
       ports scalable fonts.  The VT220 emulation does not support  soft  fonts,
       it  is  otherwise  complete.   Termcap(5)  entries  that  work with xterm
       include an optional platform-specific entry (&#8220;xterm&#8221;), &#8220;xterm&#8221;,  &#8220;vt102&#8221;,
       &#8220;vt100&#8221;,  &#8220;ansi&#8221;  and  &#8220;dumb&#8221;.   xterm automatically searches the termcap
       file in this order for these entries and then sets  the  &#8220;TERM&#8221;  and  the
       &#8220;TERMCAP&#8221; environment variables.  You may also use &#8220;vt220&#8221;,  but must set
       the terminal emulation  level  with  the  decTerminalID  resource.   (The
       &#8220;TERMCAP&#8221;  environment  variable  is not set if xterm is linked against a
       terminfo library, since the requisite information is not provided by  the
       termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).

       Many  of the special xterm features may be modified under program control
       through a set of escape  sequences  different  from  the  standard  VT102
       escape sequences.  (See the Xterm Control Sequences document.)

       The  Tektronix  4014  emulation  is also fairly good.  It supports 12-bit
       graphics addressing, scaled to the  window  size.   Four  different  font
       sizes  and  five different lines types are supported.  There is no write-
       through or defocused mode support.  The Tektronix text and graphics  com&#8208;
       mands  are  recorded  internally by xterm and may be written to a file by
       sending the COPY escape sequence (or  through  the  Tektronix  menu;  see
       below).   The  name  of the file will be &#8220;COPYyyyy-MM-dd.hh:mm:ss&#8221;, where
       yyyy, MM, dd, hh, mm and ss are the year, month, day,  hour,  minute  and
       second  when the COPY was performed (the file is created in the directory
       xterm is started in, or the home directory for a login xterm).

       Not all of the features described in this manual are  necessarily  avail&#8208;
       able in this version of xterm.  Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are
       available only if they were compiled in, though  the  most  commonly-used
       are in the default configuration.
&#12;OTHER FEATURES
       Xterm  automatically  highlights  the text cursor when the pointer enters
       the window (selected) and unhighlights it when  the  pointer  leaves  the
       window  (unselected).   If  the window is the focus window, then the text
       cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.

       In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and  deactivate  an
       alternate  screen  buffer,  which is the same size as the display area of
       the window.  When activated, the current screen  is  saved  and  replaced
       with  the  alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the
       window is disabled until the normal screen is restored.   The  termcap(5)
       entry for xterm allows the visual editor vi(1) to switch to the alternate
       screen for editing and to restore the screen on exit.  A popup menu entry
       makes  it  simple  to switch between the normal and alternate screens for
       cut and paste.

       In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences  to  change
       the  name  of the windows.  Additionally, in VT102 mode, xterm implements
       the window-manipulation control sequences from dtterm, such  as  resizing
       the window, setting its location on the screen.

       Xterm  allows  character-based applications to receive mouse events (cur&#8208;
       rently button-press and release events, and button-motion events) as key&#8208;
       board control sequences.  See Xterm Control Sequences for details.

OPTIONS
       The  xterm  terminal emulator accepts the standard X Toolkit command line
       options as well as many  application-specific  options.   If  the  option
       begins with a `+&apos; instead of a `-&apos;, the option is restored to its default
       value.  The -version and -help options are interpreted even if xterm can&#8208;
       not  open  the  display,  and  are  useful  for testing and configuration
       scripts.  Along with -class, they are checked before other options.

       -version
               This causes xterm to print a version number to the standard  out&#8208;
               put, and then exit.

       -help   This  causes  xterm to print out a verbose message describing its
               options, one per line.  The message is written  to  the  standard
               output.   After  printing the message, xterm exits.  Xterm gener&#8208;
               ates this message, sorting it and noting whether a &#8220;-option&#8221; or a
               &#8220;+option&#8221;  turns  the feature on or off, since some features his&#8208;
               torically have been one or the other.  Xterm generates a  concise
               help  message  (multiple options per line) when an unknown option
               is used, e.g.,

                   xterm -z

               If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not  com&#8208;
               piled  into xterm, the help text for that option also is not dis&#8208;
               played by the -help option.

       One parameter (after all options) may be given.  That  overrides  xterm&apos;s
       built-in  choice of shell program.  Normally xterm checks the SHELL vari&#8208;
       able.  If that is not set, xterm tries to use the shell program specified
       in  the  password  file.  If that is not set, xterm uses /bin/sh.  If the
       parameter is not a relative path, i.e., beginning  with  &#8220;./&#8221;  or  &#8220;../&#8221;,
       xterm  looks  for  the  file in the user&apos;s PATH.  In either case, it con&#8208;
       structs an absolute path.  The -e option cannot be used with this parame&#8208;
       ter since it uses all parameters following the option.

       The  other  options are used to control the appearance and behavior.  Not
       all options are necessarily configured into your copy of xterm:

       -132    Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between
               80  and  132 column mode is ignored.  This option causes the DEC&#8208;
               COLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the xterm window  will
               resize appropriately.

       -ah     This option indicates that xterm should always highlight the text
               cursor.  By default, xterm will  display  a  hollow  text  cursor
               whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the window.

       +ah     This option indicates that xterm should do text cursor highlight&#8208;
               ing based on focus.

       -ai     This option disables active icon support if that feature was com&#8208;
               piled  into  xterm.   This  is  equivalent  to  setting the vt100
               resource activeIcon to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +ai     This option enables active icon support if that feature was  com&#8208;
               piled  into  xterm.   This  is  equivalent  to  setting the vt100
               resource activeIcon to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -aw     This option indicates that  auto-wraparound  should  be  allowed.
               This  allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of
               the next line when it is at the rightmost position of a line  and
               text is output.

       +aw     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed.

       -b number
               This  option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance
               between the outer edge of the characters and the  window  border)
               in  pixels.   That  is  the  vt100  internalBorder resource.  The
               default is &#8220;2&#8221;.

       +bc     turn off text cursor blinking.  This  overrides  the  cursorBlink
               resource.

       -bc     turn  on  text  cursor  blinking.  This overrides the cursorBlink
               resource.

       -bcf milliseconds
               set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking  via  the
               cursorOffTime resource.

       -bcn milliseconds
               set  the  amount  of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
               cursorOffTime resource.

       -bdc    Set the vt100 resource colorBDMode to &#8220;false&#8221;, disabling the dis&#8208;
               play of characters with bold attribute as color

       +bdc    Set  the  vt100 resource colorBDMode to &#8220;true&#8221;, enabling the dis&#8208;
               play of characters with bold attribute as color rather than bold

       -cb     Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +cb     Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -cc characterclassrange:value[,...]
               This sets classes indicated by the  given  ranges  for  using  in
               selecting   by  words.   See  the  section  specifying  character
               classes.  and discussion of the charClass resource.

       -cjk_width
               Set the cjkWidth resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.  When turned on,  characters
               with  East  Asian  Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11 have a column
               width of 2.  Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.  This  may
               be useful for some legacy CJK text terminal-based programs assum&#8208;
               ing box drawings and others to have a column width of 2.  It also
               should  be turned on when you specify a TrueType CJK double-width
               (bi-width/monospace) font either with -fa at the command line  or
               faceName resource.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;

       +cjk_width
               Reset the cjkWidth resource.

       -class string
               This  option allows you to override xterm&apos;s resource class.  Nor&#8208;
               mally it is &#8220;XTerm&#8221;, but can be set  to  another  class  such  as
               &#8220;UXTerm&#8221; to override selected resources.

       -cm     This  option  disables  recognition  of  ANSI color-change escape
               sequences.  It sets the colorMode resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +cm     This option  enables  recognition  of  ANSI  color-change  escape
               sequences.  This is the same as the vt100 resource colorMode.

       -cn     This  option  indicates  that newlines should not be cut in line-
               mode selections.  It sets the cutNewline resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +cn     This option indicates that newlines should be  cut  in  line-mode
               selections.  It sets the cutNewline resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -cr color
               This  option  specifies  the  color  to use for text cursor.  The
               default is to use the same foreground  color  that  is  used  for
               text.   It sets the cursorColor resource according to the parame&#8208;
               ter.

       -cu     This option indicates that xterm should work around a bug in  the
               more(1)  program that causes it to incorrectly display lines that
               are exactly the width of the window and are followed  by  a  line
               beginning  with a tab (the leading tabs are not displayed).  This
               option is so named because it was originally thought to be a  bug
               in the curses(3x) cursor motion package.

       +cu     This  option  indicates  that  xterm  should  not work around the
               more(1) bug mentioned above.

       -dc     This option disables the escape sequence to change  dynamic  col&#8208;
               ors:  the vt100 foreground and background colors, its text cursor
               color, the pointer cursor foreground and background  colors,  the
               Tektronix  emulator  foreground  and  background colors, its text
               cursor color and highlight color.  The option sets  the  dynamic&#8208;
               Colors option to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +dc     This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors.
               The option sets the dynamicColors option to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -e program [ arguments ... ]
               This option specifies the program (and  its  command  line  argu&#8208;
               ments)  to  be  run in the xterm window.  It also sets the window
               title and icon name to be the basename of the program being  exe&#8208;
               cuted  if  neither -T nor -n are given on the command line.  This
               must be the last option on the command line.

       -en encoding
               This option determines the encoding on which xterm runs.  It sets
               the locale resource.  Encodings other than UTF-8 are supported by
               using luit.  The -lc option should be used  instead  of  -en  for
               systems with locale support.

       -fb font
               This  option  specifies  a  font  to be used when displaying bold
               text.  It sets the boldFont resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the  normal  font,
               otherwise it is ignored.  If only one of the normal or bold fonts
               is specified, it will be used as the normal  font  and  the  bold
               font will be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of boldMode and alwaysBoldMode resources.

       -fa pattern
               This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType
               library if support for that  library  was  compiled  into  xterm.
               This  corresponds  to  the faceName resource.  When a CJK double-
               width font is specified, you also need to turn  on  the  cjkWidth
               resource.

               See  also  the  renderFont  resource, which combines with this to
               determine whether FreeType fonts are initially active.

       -fbb    This option indicates that xterm should compare normal  and  bold
               fonts  bounding boxes to ensure they are compatible.  It sets the
               freeBoldBox resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +fbb    This option indicates that xterm should not  compare  normal  and
               bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are compatible.  It sets
               the freeBoldBox resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -fbx    This option indicates that xterm should not assume that the  nor&#8208;
               mal  and  bold  fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.  If any
               are missing, xterm will draw the characters  directly.   It  sets
               the forceBoxChars resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +fbx    This  option  indicates  that xterm should assume that the normal
               and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.  It  sets  the
               forceBoxChars resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       -fd pattern
               This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from
               the FreeType library if support for  that  library  was  compiled
               into xterm.  This corresponds to the faceNameDoublesize resource.

       -fi font
               This  option  sets  the font for active icons if that feature was
               compiled into xterm.

               See also the discussion of the iconFont resource.

       -fs size
               This option sets  the  pointsize  for  fonts  selected  from  the
               FreeType  library  if  support for that library was compiled into
               xterm.  This corresponds to the faceSize resource.

       -fullscreen
               This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to
               let it use the full-screen for display, e.g., without window dec&#8208;
               orations.  It sets the fullscreen resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       +fullscreen
               This option indicates that xterm should not ask the  window  man&#8208;
               ager  to  let  it  use  the full-screen for display.  It sets the
               fullscreen resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       -fw font
               This option specifies the font to be  used  for  displaying  wide
               text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as
               the font that will be used to draw normal text.   If  no  double-
               width  font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal
               font.  This corresponds to the wideFont resource.

       -fwb font
               This option specifies the font to be  used  for  displaying  bold
               wide  text.   By  default, it will attempt to use a font twice as
               wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no dou&#8208;
               ble-width  font  is  found,  it will improvise, by stretching the
               bold font.  This corresponds to the wideBoldFont resource.

       -fx font
               This option specifies the font to  be  used  for  displaying  the
               preedit string in the &#8220;OverTheSpot&#8221; input method.

               See also the discussion of the ximFont resource.

       -hc color
               (see -selbg).

       -hf     This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should be
               generated for function keys.  It sets the hpFunctionKeys resource
               to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       +hf     This  option  indicates  that HP Function Key escape codes should
               not be generated for function keys.  It sets  the  hpFunctionKeys
               resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       -hm     Tells xterm to use highlightTextColor and highlightColor to over&#8208;
               ride the reversed foreground/background colors  in  a  selection.
               It sets the highlightColorMode resource to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       +hm     Tells  xterm  not to use highlightTextColor and highlightColor to
               override the reversed foreground/background colors  in  a  selec&#8208;
               tion.  It sets the highlightColorMode resource to &#8220;false&#8221;.

       -hold   Turn  on  the  hold  resource,  i.e.,  xterm will not immediately
               destroy its window when the shell  command  completes.   It  will
               wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window,
               or if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g.,  HUP  or
               KILL.

       +hold   Turn  off the hold resource, i.e., xterm will immediately destroy
               its window when the shell command completes.

       -ie     Turn on the ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., use the pseudo-termi&#8208;
               nal&apos;s sense of the stty erase value.

       +ie     Turn  off  the ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., set the stty erase
               value using the kb string from the termcap entry as a  reference,
               if available.

       -im     Turn  on  the  useInsertMode resource, which forces use of insert
               mode by adding appropriate entries  to  the  TERMCAP  environment
               variable.

       +im     Turn off the useInsertMode resource.

       -into windowId
               Given  an X window identifier (an integer, which can be hexadeci&#8208;
               mal, octal or decimal according to whether it begins  with  &quot;0x&quot;,
               &quot;0&quot;  or  neither), xterm will reparent its top-level shell widget
               to that window.  This is used to embed xterm within other  appli&#8208;
               cations.

       For  instance,  there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used to
       demonstrate the feature.  When using Gtk, there is a limitation  of  that
       toolkit which requires that xterm&apos;s allowSendEvents resource is enabled.

       -j      This  option  indicates  that xterm should do jump scrolling.  It
               corresponds  to  the  jumpScroll  resource.   Normally,  text  is
               scrolled  one  line  at  a time; this option allows xterm to move
               multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far  behind.
               Its  use is strongly recommended since it makes xterm much faster
               when scanning through large amounts of text.   The  VT100  escape
               sequences for enabling and disabling smooth scroll as well as the
               &#8220;VT Options&#8221; menu can be used to turn this feature on or off.

       +j      This option indicates that xterm should not do jump scrolling.

       -k8     This   option   sets   the   allowC1Printable   resource.    When
               allowC1Printable  is  set, xterm overrides the mapping of C1 con&#8208;
               trol characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable.

       +k8     This option resets the allowC1Printable resource.

       -kt keyboardtype
               This option sets  the  keyboardType  resource.   Possible  values
               include:  &#8220;unknown&#8221;,  &#8220;default&#8221;,  &#8220;hp&#8221;,  &#8220;sco&#8221;, &#8220;sun&#8221;, &#8220;tcap&#8221; and
               &#8220;vt220&#8221;.

               The value &#8220;unknown&#8221;, causes  the  corresponding  resource  to  be
               ignored.

               The  value &#8220;default&#8221;, suppresses the associated resources hpFunc&#8208;
               tionKeys, scoFunctionKeys, sunFunctionKeys, tcapFunctionKeys  and
               sunKeyboard, using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.

       -l      Turn logging on.  Normally logging is not supported, due to secu&#8208;
               rity concerns.  Some versions of xterm may have logging  enabled.
               The  logfile  is  written  to  the  directory from which xterm is
               invoked.  The filename is generated, of the form

                    XtermLog.XXXXXX

               or

                    Xterm.log.hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX

               depending on how xterm was built.

       +l      Turn logging off.

       -lc     Turn on support of various  encodings  according  to  the  users&apos;
               locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment vari&#8208;
               ables.  This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by invoking
               luit for conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8.  (luit is
               not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)  This corresponds  to  the  locale
               resource.

               The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by
               luit.  Consult the luit manual page for further details.

               See also the discussion of the -u8 option  which  supports  UTF-8
               locales.

       +lc     Turn  off  support  of  automatic  selection of locale encodings.
               Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with  -u8  option,
               UTF-8 mode will be used.

       -lcc path
               File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and
               UTF-8 which is used with -lc option  or  locale  resource.   This
               corresponds to the localeFilter resource.

       -leftbar
               Force  scrollbar  to  the left side of VT100 screen.  This is the
               default, unless you have set the rightScrollBar resource.

       -lf filename
               Specify the log-filename.  See the -l option.

       -ls     This option indicates that the shell that is started in the xterm
               window  will  be  a  login  shell  (i.e.,  the first character of
               argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell  that  it  should
               read the user&apos;s .login or .profile).

               The  -ls  flag  and  the loginShell resource are ignored if -e is
               also given, because xterm does not know how  to  make  the  shell
               start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login
               shell - the user&apos;s shell of choice need not  be  a  Bourne  shell
               after  all.   Also,  xterm -e is supposed to provide a consistent
               functionality for other applications that need to start text-mode
               programs  in  a  window,  and if loginShell were not ignored, the
               result of ~/.profile might interfere with that.

               If you do want the effect of -ls and -e simultaneously,  you  may
               get away with something like

                   xterm -e /bin/bash -l -c &quot;my command here&quot;

               Finally, -ls is not completely ignored, because xterm -ls -e does
               write a /var/log/wtmp entry (if configured  to  do  so),  whereas
               xterm -e does not.

       -maximized
               This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to
               maximize its layout on startup.  This corresponds  to  the  maxi&#8208;
               mized resource.

               Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying; it is possible to do
               both with certain window managers.

       +maximized
               This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to
               maximize its layout on startup.

       +ls     This  option  indicates that the shell that is started should not
               be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal &#8220;subshell&#8221;).

       -mb     This option indicates that xterm should ring a margin  bell  when
               the user types near the right end of a line.

       +mb     This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.

       -mc milliseconds
               This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selec&#8208;
               tions.

       -mesg   Turn off the messages resource, i.e., disallow  write  access  to
               the terminal.

       +mesg   Turn  on  the  messages resource, i.e., allow write access to the
               terminal.

       -mk_width
               Set the mkWidth resource to  &#8220;true&#8221;.   This  makes  xterm  use  a
               built-in  version  of  the wide-character width calculation.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;
&#12;       +mk_width
               Reset the mkWidth resource.

       -ms color
               This option specifies the color to be used for the  pointer  cur&#8208;
               sor.   The default is to use the foreground color.  This sets the
               pointerColor resource.

       -nb number
               This option specifies the number of characters from the right end
               of  a  line at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring.  The
               default is &#8220;10&#8221;.

       -nul    This option disables the display of underlining.

       +nul    This option enables the display of underlining.

       -pc     This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see boldCol&#8208;
               ors resource).

       +pc     This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.

       -pob    This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a
               Control-G is received.

       +pob    This option indicates that the window should not be raised  when&#8208;
               ever a Control-G is received.

       -rightbar
               Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.

       -rvc    This  option  disables  the  display  of  characters with reverse
               attribute as color.

       +rvc    This option  enables  the  display  of  characters  with  reverse
               attribute as color.

       -rw     This  option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.
               This allows the cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one
               line  to the rightmost column of the previous line.  This is very
               useful for editing long shell command lines  and  is  encouraged.
               This option can be turned on and off from the &#8220;VT Options&#8221; menu.

       +rw     This  option  indicates  that  reverse-wraparound  should  not be
               allowed.

       -s      This option indicates that xterm may scroll asynchronously, mean&#8208;
               ing  that  the  screen  does not have to be kept completely up to
               date while scrolling.  This allows xterm to run faster when  net&#8208;
               work latencies are very high and is typically useful when running
               across a very large internet or many gateways.

       +s      This option indicates that xterm should scroll synchronously.

       -samename
               Does not send title  and  icon  name  change  requests  when  the
               request  would have no effect: the name is not changed.  This has
               the advantage of  preventing  flicker  and  the  disadvantage  of
               requiring  an extra round trip to the server to find out the pre&#8208;
               vious value.  In practice this should never be a problem.

       +samename
               Always send title and icon name change requests.

       -sb     This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled
               off  the  top  of the window should be saved and that a scrollbar
               should be displayed so that those  lines  can  be  viewed.   This
               option may be turned on and off from the &#8220;VT Options&#8221; menu.

       +sb     This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.

       -selbg color
               This  option  specifies  the  color  to use for the background of
               selected text.  If not specified, reverse video is used.  See the
               discussion of the highlightColor resource.

       -selfg color
               This option specifies the color to use for selected text.  If not
               specified, reverse video is used.   See  the  discussion  of  the
               highlightTextColor resource.

       -sf     This  option  indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should
               be generated for function keys.

       +sf     This option indicates that the standard escape  codes  should  be
               generated for function keys.

       -sh number
               scale line-height values by the given number.  See the discussion
               of the scaleHeight resource.

       -si     This option indicates that output to a window should not automat&#8208;
               ically  reposition  the  screen  to  the  bottom of the scrolling
               region.  This option can be  turned  on  and  off  from  the  &#8220;VT
               Options&#8221; menu.

       +si     This  option indicates that output to a window should cause it to
               scroll to the bottom.

       -sk     This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scroll&#8208;
               bar  to  review previous lines of text should cause the window to
               be repositioned automatically in the normal position at the  bot&#8208;
               tom of the scroll region.

       +sk     This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scroll&#8208;
               bar should not cause the window to be repositioned.

       -sl number
               This option specifies the number of lines to save that have  been
               scrolled  off  the  top  of  the screen.  This corresponds to the
               saveLines resource.  The default is &#8220;64&#8221;.

       -sm     This option, corresponding to the sessionMgt resource,  indicates
               that xterm should set up session manager callbacks.

       +sm     This  option  indicates that xterm should not set up session man&#8208;
               ager callbacks.

       -sp     This option indicates that Sun/PC  keyboard  should  be  assumed,
               providing  mapping  for  keypad  &#8220;+&apos;  to &#8220;,&apos;, and CTRL-F1 to F13,
               CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.

       +sp     This option indicates that the standard escape  codes  should  be
               generated for keypad and function keys.

       -t      This  option indicates that xterm should start in Tektronix mode,
               rather than in VT102 mode.  Switching between the two windows  is
               done  using  the  &#8220;Options&#8221;  menus.  Termcap(5) entries that work
               with xterm &#8220;tek4014&#8221;, &#8220;tek4015&#8221;, &#8220;tek4012&#8221;, &#8220;tek4013&#8221;, &#8220;tek4010&#8221;,
               and  &#8220;dumb&#8221;.   xterm  automatically  searches the termcap file in
               this order for these entries and then sets  the  &#8220;TERM&#8221;  and  the
               &#8220;TERMCAP&#8221; environment variables.

       +t      This option indicates that xterm should start in VT102 mode.

       -tb     This  option,  corresponding  to  the toolBar resource, indicates
               that xterm should display a toolbar (or menubar) at  the  top  of
               its  window.   The buttons in the toolbar correspond to the popup
               menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for &#8220;Main Options&#8221;.

       +tb     This option indicates that xterm should not set up a toolbar.

       -ti term_id
               Specify the name used by xterm to select the correct response  to
               terminal ID queries.  It also specifies the emulation level, used
               to determine the type of  response  to  a  DA  control  sequence.
               Valid  values  include  vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, and vt220 (the
               &#8220;vt&#8221; is optional).  The default is &#8220;vt100&#8221;.  The term_id argument
               specifies  the  terminal  ID  to  use.   (This is the same as the
               decTerminalID resource).

       -tm string
               This option specifies a series of terminal setting keywords  fol&#8208;
               lowed  by the characters that should be bound to those functions,
               similar to the stty program.  The keywords and their  values  are
               described in detail in the ttyModes resource.

       -tn name
               This  option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in
               the TERM environment variable.  It corresponds  to  the  termName
               resource.  This terminal type must exist in the terminal database
               (termcap or terminfo, depending on how xterm is built) and should
               have  li#  and  co#  entries.  If the terminal type is not found,
               xterm uses the built-in list &#8220;xterm&#8221;, &#8220;vt102&#8221;, etc.

       -u8     This option sets the utf8 resource.   When  utf8  is  set,  xterm
               interprets  incoming  data  as  UTF-8.   This  sets the wideChars
               resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set by this  option
               prevents  it  from  being turned off.  If you must turn it on and
               off, use the wideChars resource.

               This option and the utf8 resource are overridden by the  -lc  and
               -en options and locale resource.  That is, if xterm has been com&#8208;
               piled to support luit, and the locale  resource  is  not  &#8220;false&#8221;
               this option is ignored.  We recommend using the -lc option or the
               &#8220;locale: true&#8221; resource in UTF-8 locales when your operating sys&#8208;
               tem  supports  locale, or -en UTF-8 option or the &#8220;locale: UTF-8&#8221;
               resource when your operating system does not support locale.

       +u8     This option resets the utf8 resource.

       -uc     This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.

       +uc     This option makes the cursor a box instead of underlined.

       -ulc    This option disables the display  of  characters  with  underline
               attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       +ulc    This  option  enables  the  display  of characters with underline
               attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       -ulit   This option, corresponding to the italicULMode resource, disables
               the  display  of  characters  with underline attribute as italics
               rather than with underlining.

       +ulit   This option, corresponding to the italicULMode resource,  enables
               the  display  of  characters  with underline attribute as italics
               rather than with underlining.

       -ut     This option indicates that xterm should not write a  record  into
               the the system utmp log file.

       +ut     This  option  indicates that xterm should write a record into the
               system utmp log file.

       -vb     This option indicates that a visual bell  is  preferred  over  an
               audible  one.   Instead  of  ringing the terminal bell whenever a
               Control-G is received, the window will be flashed.

       +vb     This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.

       -wc     This option sets the wideChars resource.  When wideChars is  set,
               xterm  maintains  internal  structures for 16-bit characters.  If
               you do not set this resource to &#8220;true&#8221;,  xterm  will  ignore  the
               escape  sequence  which turns UTF-8 mode on and off.  The default
               is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       +wc     This option resets the wideChars resource.

       -wf     This option indicates that xterm should wait for the window to be
               mapped  the first time before starting the subprocess so that the
               initial terminal size settings and environment variables are cor&#8208;
               rect.  It is the application&apos;s responsibility to catch subsequent
               terminal size changes.

       +wf     This option indicates that xterm should not wait before  starting
               the subprocess.

       -ziconbeep percent
               Same  as zIconBeep resource.  If percent is non-zero, xterms that
               produce output while iconified will cause an XBell sound  at  the
               given volume and have &#8220;***&#8221; prepended to their icon titles.  Most
               window managers will detect this change immediately, showing  you
               which  window  has  the  output.   (A  similar feature was in x10
               xterm.)

       -C      This option indicates that this  window  should  receive  console
               output.  This is not supported on all systems.  To obtain console
               output, you must be the owner of the console device, and you must
               have  read  and  write  permission  for it.  If you are running X
               under xdm on the console screen you may need to have the  session
               startup and reset programs explicitly change the ownership of the
               console device in order to get this option to work.

       -Sccn   This option allows xterm to be used as an input and output  chan&#8208;
               nel  for an existing program and is sometimes used in specialized
               applications.  The option value specifies the last few letters of
               the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave mode, plus the num&#8208;
               ber of the inherited file descriptor.  If the option  contains  a
               &#8220;/&#8221;  character, that delimits the characters used for the pseudo-
               terminal name from the file descriptor.  Otherwise,  exactly  two
               characters are used from the option for the pseudo-terminal name,
               the remainder is the file descriptor.  Examples  (the  first  two
               are equivalent since the descriptor follows the last &#8220;/&#8221;):

                   -S/dev/pts/123/45
                   -S123/45
                   -Sab34

               Note  that  xterm does not close any file descriptor which it did
               not open for its own use.  It is possible  (though  probably  not
               portable)  to  have  an  application  which  passes  an open file
               descriptor down to xterm past the initialization or the -S option
               to a process running in the xterm.

       The  following command line arguments are provided for compatibility with
       older versions.  They may not be supported in the next release as  the  X
       Toolkit provides standard options that accomplish the same task.

       %geom   This option specifies the preferred size and position of the Tek&#8208;
               tronix window.  It is shorthand for specifying the &#8220;*tekGeometry&#8221;
               resource.

       #geom   This  option specifies the preferred position of the icon window.
               It is shorthand for specifying the &#8220;*iconGeometry&#8221; resource.

       -T string
               This option specifies the  title  for  xterm&apos;s  windows.   It  is
               equivalent to -title.

       -n string
               This  option  specifies the icon name for xterm&apos;s windows.  It is
               shorthand for specifying the  &#8220;*iconName&#8221;  resource.   Note  that
               this  is  not  the  same as the toolkit option -name (see below).
               The default icon name is the application name.

       -r      This option indicates that reverse video should be  simulated  by
               swapping  the foreground and background colors.  It is equivalent
               to -rv.

       -w number
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surround&#8208;
               ing the window.  It is equivalent to -borderwidth or -bw.

       The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used
       with xterm:

       -bd color
               This option specifies the color to use for the border of the win&#8208;
               dow.  The corresponding resource name is borderColor.  xterm uses
               the X Toolkit default, which is &#8220;XtDefaultForeground&#8221;.

       -bg color
               This option specifies the color to use for the background of  the
               window.   The  corresponding  resource  name  is background.  The
               default is &#8220;XtDefaultBackground&#8221;.

       -bw number
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surround&#8208;
               ing the window.

               This  appears  to  be  a legacy of older X releases.  It sets the
               borderWidth resource of the shell widget, and may provide  advice
               to  your window manager to set the thickness of the window frame.
               Most window managers do not use this  information.   See  the  -b
               option, which controls the inner border of the xterm window.

       -display display
               This option specifies the X server to contact; see X(7).

       -fg color
               This  option specifies the color to use for displaying text.  The
               corresponding resource name is foreground.  The default is &#8220;XtDe&#8208;
               faultForeground&#8221;.

       -fn font
               This  option  specifies the font to be used for displaying normal
               text.  The corresponding resource name  is  font.   The  resource
               value default is fixed.
&#12;       -font font
               This is the same as -fn.

       -geometry geometry
               This  option  specifies  the  preferred  size and position of the
               VT102 window; see X(7).

       -iconic This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to
               start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.  The corre&#8208;
               sponding resource name is iconic.

       -name name
               This option specifies the application name under which  resources
               are to be obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
               Name should not contain &#8220;.&#8221; or &#8220;*&#8221; characters.

       -rv     This option indicates that reverse video should be  simulated  by
               swapping the foreground and background colors.  The corresponding
               resource name is reverseVideo.

       +rv     Disable the simulation of reverse video  by  swapping  foreground
               and background colors.

       -title string
               This  option specifies the window title string, which may be dis&#8208;
               played by window managers if the user so  chooses.   The  default
               title  is the command line specified after the -e option, if any,
               otherwise the application name.

       -xrm resourcestring
               This option specifies a resource string  to  be  used.   This  is
               especially useful for setting resources that do not have separate
               command line options.

RESOURCES
       The program understands all of the core  X  Toolkit  resource  names  and
       classes.  Application specific resources (e.g., &#8220;XTerm.NAME&#8221;) follow:

       backarrowKeyIsErase (class BackarrowKeyIsErase)
               Tie the VTxxx backarrowKey and ptyInitialErase resources together
               by setting the DECBKM state  according  to  whether  the  initial
               value of stty erase is a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;, which disables this feature.

       fullscreen (class Fullscreen)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should ask the window  manager  to
               use  a fullscreen layout on startup.  Xterm accepts either a key&#8208;
               word (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used initially, but may be later  via
                  menu-selection or control sequence.

               true (1)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, but may be disabled later
                  via menu-selection or control sequence.

               always (2)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, and  cannot  be  disabled
                  later via menu-selection or control sequence.

               never (3)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used, and cannot be enabled later via
                  menu-selection or control sequence.

               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.
&#12;       hold (class Hold)
               If true, xterm will not immediately destroy its window  when  the
               shell  command  completes.  It will wait until you use the window
               manager to destroy/kill the  window,  or  if  you  use  the  menu
               entries  that  send  a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.  You may scroll
               back, select text, etc., to perform  most  graphical  operations.
               Resizing the display will lose data, however, since this involves
               interaction with the shell which is no longer running.

       hpFunctionKeys (class HpFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not HP Function Key escape codes  should  be
               generated for function keys instead of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       iconGeometry (class IconGeometry)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when
               iconified.  It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

       iconName (class IconName)
               Specifies the icon name.  The default is  the  application  name,
               e.g., &#8220;xterm&#8221;.

       keyboardType (class KeyboardType)
               Enables  one  (or  none)  of the various keyboard-type resources:
               hpFunctionKeys, scoFunctionKeys,  sunFunctionKeys,  tcapFunction&#8208;
               Keys  and sunKeyboard.  The resource&apos;s value should be one of the
               corresponding strings &#8220;hp&#8221;, &#8220;sco&#8221;, &#8220;sun&#8221;, &#8220;tcap&#8221; or &#8220;vt220&#8221;.  The
               individual  resources  are  provided  for  legacy  support;  this
               resource is simpler to use.

               The default is &#8220;unknown&#8221;, i.e., none of the associated  resources
               are set via this resource.

       maxBufSize (class MaxBufSize)
               Specify  the  maximum  size  of the input buffer.  The default is
               &#8220;32768&#8221;.  You cannot set this to a value less than the minBufSize
               resource.   It  will  be  increased  as needed to make that value
               evenly divide this one.

               On some systems you may want to  increase  one  or  both  of  the
               maxBufSize  and minBufSize resource values to achieve better per&#8208;
               formance if the operating system prefers larger buffer sizes.

       maximized (class Maximized)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should ask the window  manager  to
               maximize its layout on startup.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       messages (class Messages)
               Specifies  whether  write  access to the terminal is allowed ini&#8208;
               tially.  See mesg(1).  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       menuLocale (class MenuLocale)
                Specify the locale  used  for  character-set  computations  when
                loading  the  popup  menus.   Use this to improve initialization
                performance of the Athena popup menus, which may  load  unneces&#8208;
                sary  (and  very  large)  fonts,  e.g., in a locale having UTF-8
                encoding.  The default is &#8220;C&#8221; (POSIX).

                To use the current locale (only useful if you have localized the
                resource  settings for the menu entries), set the resource to an
                empty string.

       minBufSize (class MinBufSize)
               Specify the minimum size of the input buffer, i.e., the amount of
               data  that  xterm  requests on each read.  The default is &#8220;4096&#8221;.
               You cannot set this to a value less than 64.

       omitTranslation (class OmitTranslation)
               Selectively omit one or more parts of  xterm&apos;s  default  transla&#8208;
               tions  at  startup.  The resource value is a comma-separated list
               of keywords, which may  be  abbreviated:  &#8220;fullscreen&#8221;,  &#8220;scroll-
               lock&#8221;,  &#8220;shift-fonts&#8221;  or  &#8220;wheel-mouse&#8221;.   Xterm also recognizes
               &#8220;default&#8221;, but omitting  that  will  make  the  program  unusable
               unless  you  provide  a  similar definition in your resource set&#8208;
               tings.

       ptyHandshake (class PtyHandshake)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm will perform handshaking  during  initialization
               to ensure that the parent and child processes update the utmp and
               stty state.

               See also waitForMap which waits for the pseudo-terminal&apos;s  notion
               of  the screen size, and ptySttySize which resets the screen size
               after other terminal initialization is complete.  The default  is
               &#8220;true&#8221;.

       ptyInitialErase (class PtyInitialErase)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm will use the pseudo-terminal&apos;s sense of the stty
               erase value.  If &#8220;false&#8221;, xterm will set the stty erase value  to
               match its own configuration, using the kb string from the termcap
               entry as a reference, if available.  In either case,  the  result
               is applied to the TERMCAP variable which xterm sets.

               See  also  the  ttyModes  resource,  which  may modify this.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       ptySttySize (class PtySttySize)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm will reset the screen size after  terminal  ini&#8208;
               tialization  is  complete.  This is needed for some systems whose
               pseudo-terminals  cannot  propagate   terminal   characteristics.
               Where  it  is not needed, it can interfere with other methods for
               setting the intial screen size, e.g., via window manager interac&#8208;
               tion.

               See  also  waitForMap  which waits for a handshake-message giving
               the pseudo-terminal&apos;s notion of the screen size.  The default  is
               &#8220;false&#8221; on Linux and OS X systems, &#8220;true&#8221; otherwise.

       sameName (class SameName)
               If  the  value  of  this  resource is &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm does not send
               title and icon name change requests when the request  would  have
               no  effect:  the  name is not changed.  This has the advantage of
               preventing flicker and the disadvantage  of  requiring  an  extra
               round  trip  to  the  server  to find out the previous value.  In
               practice this should never be a problem.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       scaleHeight (class ScaleHeight)
               Scale line-height values by the resource value, which is  limited
               to &#8220;0.9&#8221; to &#8220;1.5&#8221;.  The default value is &#8220;1.0&#8221;,

               While  this  resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts,
               its main purpose is to help work around incompatible  changes  in
               the Xft library&apos;s font metrics.  Xterm checks the font metrics to
               find what the library claims are  the  bounding  boxes  for  each
               glyph  (character).  However, some of Xft&apos;s features (such as the
               autohinter) can cause the glyphs to be  scaled  larger  than  the
               bounding boxes, and be partly overwritten by the next row.

               See useClipping for a related resource.

       scoFunctionKeys (class ScoFunctionKeys)
               Specifies  whether or not SCO Function Key escape codes should be
               generated for function keys instead of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       sessionMgt (class SessionMgt)
               If the value of this resource is &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm  sets  up  session
               manager  callbacks  for  XtNdieCallback and XtNsaveCallback.  The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       sunFunctionKeys (class SunFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not Sun Function Key escape codes should  be
               generated for function keys instead of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       sunKeyboard (class SunKeyboard)
               Specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard layout should be assumed
               rather than DEC VT220.  This causes the keypad &#8220;+&apos; to  be  mapped
               to  &#8220;,&apos;.  and CTRL F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of
               the ctrlFKeys resource.  so xterm emulates a DEC VT220 more accu&#8208;
               rately.    Otherwise   (the  default,  with  sunKeyboard  set  to
               &#8220;false&#8221;), xterm uses PC-style bindings for the function keys  and
               keypad.

               PC-style  bindings  use  the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as
               modifiers for function-keys and keypad (see  the  document  Xterm
               Control Sequences for details).  The PC-style bindings are analo&#8208;
               gous to PCTerm, but not the same thing.  Normally these  bindings
               do not conflict with the use of the Meta key as described for the
               eightBitInput resource.  If they do, note that the PC-style bind&#8208;
               ings are evaluated first.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       tcapFunctionKeys (class TcapFunctionKeys)
               Specifies  whether or not function key escape codes read from the
               termcap/terminfo entry should  be  generated  for  function  keys
               instead  of  standard  escape sequences.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;,
               i.e., this feature is disabled.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       termName (class TermName)
               Specifies the terminal type name to be set in the  TERM  environ&#8208;
               ment variable.

       title (class Title)
               Specifies  a  string  that may be used by the window manager when
               displaying this application.

       toolBar (class ToolBar)
               Specifies whether or not the toolbar should  be  displayed.   The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       ttyModes (class TtyModes)
               Specifies  a  string containing terminal setting keywords and the
               characters to  which  they  may  be  bound.   Allowable  keywords
               include:  brk, dsusp, eof, eol, eol2, erase, erase2, flush, intr,
               kill, lnext, quit, rprnt, start, status, stop,  susp,  swtch  and
               weras.  Control characters may be specified as ^char (e.g., ^c or
               ^u) and ^? may be used to  indicate  delete  (127).   Use  ^-  to
               denote  undef.   Use  \034 to represent ^\, since a literal back&#8208;
               slash in an X resource escapes the next character.

               This is very useful for overriding the default terminal  settings
               without  having  to  do  an  stty every time an xterm is started.
               Note, however, that the stty program on a given host may use dif&#8208;
               ferent keywords; xterm&apos;s table is built-in.

               If  the ttyModes resource specifies a value for erase, that over&#8208;
               rides the ptyInitialErase resource setting, i.e., xterm  initial&#8208;
               izes the terminal to match that value.

       useInsertMode (class UseInsertMode)
               Force  use  of  insert  mode by adding appropriate entries to the
               TERMCAP environment variable.  This is useful if the system term&#8208;
               cap is broken.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       utmpDisplayId (class UtmpDisplayId)
               Specifies  whether  or not xterm should try to record the display
               identifier (display number and screen  number)  as  well  as  the
               hostname in the system utmp log file.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       utmpInhibit (class UtmpInhibit)
               Specifies  whether  or  not xterm should try to record the user&apos;s
               terminal in the system utmp log file.  If true,  xterm  will  not
               try.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       waitForMap (class WaitForMap)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should wait for the initial window
               map before starting the subprocess.  This is part of the ptyHand&#8208;
               shake  logic.  When xterm is directed to wait in this fashion, it
               passes the terminal size from the display end of the  pseudo-ter&#8208;
               minal to the terminal I/O connection, e.g., according to the win&#8208;
               dow manager.  Otherwise, it uses the size as  given  in  resource
               values or command-line option -geom.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       zIconBeep (class ZIconBeep)
               Same  as  -ziconbeep command line argument.  If the value of this
               resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output while  iconified
               will  cause  an  XBell  sound  at the given volume and have &#8220;***&#8221;
               prepended to their icon titles.  Most window managers will detect
               this change immediately, showing you which window has the output.
               (A similar feature was in x10 xterm.)  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

   VT100 Widget Resources
       The following resources are specified as part of the vt100 widget  (class
       VT100).  They are specified by patterns such as &#8220;XTerm.vt100.NAME&#8221;.

       If your xterm is configured to support the &#8220;toolbar&#8221;, then those patterns
       need an extra level for the form-widget which holds the toolbar and vt100
       widget.   A wildcard between the top-level &#8220;XTerm&#8221; and the &#8220;vt100&#8221; widget
       makes the resource settings work for either, e.g., &#8220;XTerm*vt100.NAME&#8221;.

       activeIcon (class ActiveIcon)
               Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used  when
               the  xterm  window is iconified, if this feature is compiled into
               xterm.  The active icon is a miniature representation of the con&#8208;
               tent  of  the window and will update as the content changes.  Not
               all window managers necessarily support application icon windows.
               Some  window managers will allow you to enter keystrokes into the
               active icon window.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       allowBoldFonts (class AllowBoldFonts)
               When set to &#8220;false&#8221;, xterm will not use bold fonts.   This  over&#8208;
               rides   both  the  alwaysBoldMode  and  the  boldMode  resources.
               alwaysBoldMode (class AlwaysBoldMode)

       allowC1Printable (class AllowC1Printable)
               If true, overrides the mapping of C1 controls (codes 128-159)  to
               make  them  be  treated  as  if  they  were printable characters.
               Although this corresponds to no particular standard,  some  users
               insist it is a VT100.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       allowColorOps (class AllowColorOps)
               Specifies  whether  control  sequences that set/query the dynamic
               colors should be allowed.  ANSI colors  are  unaffected  by  this
               resource setting.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       allowFontOps (class AllowFontOps)
               Specifies  whether  control  sequences  that  set/query  the font
               should be allowed.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       allowScrollLock (class AllowScrollLock)
               Specifies whether control sequences  that  set/query  the  Scroll
               Lock  key  should  be allowed, as well as whether the Scroll Lock
               key responds to user&apos;s keypress.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               When this feature is enabled, xterm will sense the state  of  the
               Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus.  Pressing the Scroll
               Lock key toggles xterm&apos;s internal state, as well as toggling  the
               associated  LED.  While the Scroll Lock is active, xterm attempts
               to keep a viewport on the same set  of  lines.   If  the  current
               viewport  is  scrolled  past  the  limit  set  by  the  saveLines
               resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.

               The reason for setting the default to &#8220;false&#8221; is  to  avoid  user
               surprise.   This  key  is generally unused in keyboard configura&#8208;
               tions, and has not acquired a standard meaning even  when  it  is
               used in that manner.  Consequently, users have assigned it for ad
               hoc purposes.

       allowSendEvents (class AllowSendEvents)
               Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events  (gener&#8208;
               ated  using  the  X  protocol SendEvent request) should be inter&#8208;
               preted or discarded.  The default is  &#8220;false&#8221;  meaning  they  are
               discarded.   Note  that  allowing such events would create a very
               large security hole, therefore enabling this resource  forcefully
               disables the allowXXXOps resources.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       allowTcapOps (class AllowTcapOps)
               Specifies  whether  control  sequences  that query the terminal&apos;s
               notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo  capa&#8208;
               bilities should be allowed.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               A  few  programs,  e.g., vim, use this feature to get an accurate
               description of the terminal&apos;s capabilities,  independent  of  the
               termcap/terminfo setting:

               -  xterm  can  tell  the querying program how many colors it sup&#8208;
                  ports.  This is a constant, depending on how it  is  compiled,
                  typically  16.   It does not change if you alter resource set&#8208;
                  tings, e.g., the boldColors resource.

               -  xterm can tell the querying program what strings are  sent  by
                  modified  (shift-,  control-, alt-) function- and keypad-keys.
                  Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature that  relies
                  on the ncurses extended naming.

       allowTitleOps (class AllowTitleOps)
               Specifies  whether control sequences that modify the window title
               or icon name should be allowed.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       allowWindowOps (class AllowWindowOps)
               Specifies whether extended window control sequences (as  used  in
               dtterm)   should  be  allowed.   These  include  several  control
               sequences which manipulate the window size or position,  as  well
               as  reporting  these  values and the title or icon name.  Each of
               these can be abused in a script; curiously enough  most  terminal
               emulators  that implement these restrict only a small part of the
               repertoire.   For  fine-tuning,  see  disallowedWindowOps.    The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       altIsNotMeta (class AltIsNotMeta)
               If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  treat  the Alt-key as if it were the Meta-key.  Your
               keyboard may happen to be configured so they are the  same.   But
               if  they  are  not,  this  allows you to use the same prefix- and
               shifting operations with the Alt-key as with the  Meta-key.   See
               altSendsEscape and metaSendsEscape.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       altSendsEscape (class AltSendsEscape)
               This  is  an  additional keyboard operation that may be processed
               after the logic for metaSendsEscape.  It is only available if the
               altIsNotMeta resource is set.

               &#183;   If &#8220;true&#8221;, Alt characters (a character combined with the mod&#8208;
                   ifier associated with left/right Alt-keys) are converted into
                   a  two-character  sequence with the character itself preceded
                   by ESC.   This  applies  as  well  to  function  key  control
                   sequences,  unless  xterm  sees  that Alt is used in your key
                   translations.

               &#183;   If &#8220;false&#8221;, Alt characters input from the  keyboard  cause  a
                   shift  to  8-bit  characters (just like metaSendsEscape).  By
                   combining the Alt- and Meta-modifiers, you can create  corre&#8208;
                   sponding  combinations  of  ESC-prefix  and 8-bit characters.
                   The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               Xterm provides a menu option for toggling this resource.

       alwaysBoldMode (class AlwaysBoldMode)
               Specifies whether xterm should check if the normal and bold fonts
               are distinct before deciding whether to use overstriking to simu&#8208;
               late bold fonts.  If this resource is true, xterm does  not  make
               the  check  for  distinct  fonts  when deciding how to handle the
               boldMode resource.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               l l l l _ _ _  _  l  l  l  l.   boldMode  alwaysBoldMode Compari&#8208;
               son     Action       false     false     ignored   use       font
               false     true ignored   use font  true false     same overstrike
               true false     different use font true true ignored   overstrike

               As  an  alternative, setting the allowBoldFonts resource to false
               overrides both the alwaysBoldMode and the boldMode resources.

       alwaysHighlight (class AlwaysHighlight)
               Specifies whether or not xterm  should  always  display  a  high&#8208;
               lighted  text  cursor.  By default (if this resource is false), a
               hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the pointer moves out of
               the  window  or the window loses the input focus.  The default is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       alwaysUseMods (class AlwaysUseMods)
               Override the numLock resource, telling xterm to use the  Alt  and
               Meta modifiers to construct parameters for function key sequences
               even if those modifiers  appear  in  the  translations  resource.
               Normally  xterm  checks  if  Alt or Meta is used in a translation
               that would conflict with function key modifiers, and will  ignore
               these modifiers in that special case.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       answerbackString (class AnswerbackString)
               Specifies the string that xterm sends in response to an ENQ (con&#8208;
               trol/E) character from the host.  The default is a blank  string,
               i.e.,  &#8220;&#8221;.   A  hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup
               option.

       appcursorDefault (class AppcursorDefault)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, the cursor keys are  initially  in  application  mode.
               This is the same as the VT102 private DECCKM mode, The default is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       appkeypadDefault (class AppkeypadDefault)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, the keypad keys are  initially  in  application  mode.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.
&#12;       autoWrap (class AutoWrap)
               Specifies whether or not auto-wraparound should be enabled.  This
               is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       awaitInput (class AwaitInput)
               Specifies whether or not the xterm uses a 50 millisecond  timeout
               to await input (i.e., to support the Xaw3d arrow scrollbar).  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       backarrowKey (class BackarrowKey)
               Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits a backspace (8)  or
               delete  (127)  character.  This corresponds to the DECBKM control
               sequence.  The default (backspace) is &#8220;true&#8221;.  Pressing the  con&#8208;
               trol key toggles this behavior.

       background (class Background)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the window.  The
               default is &#8220;XtDefaultBackground&#8221;.

       bellIsUrgent (class BellIsUrgent)
               Specifies whether to set the Urgency hint for the window  manager
               when making a bell sound.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       bellOnReset (class BellOnReset)
               Specifies  whether  to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.  The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       bellSuppressTime (class BellSuppressTime)
               Number of milliseconds after a bell command is sent during  which
               additional  bells  will  be  suppressed.  Default is 200.  If set
               non-zero, additional bells will  also  be  suppressed  until  the
               server  reports  that  processing of the first bell has been com&#8208;
               pleted; this feature is most useful with the visible bell.

       boldColors (class ColorMode)
               Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like  the
               IBM  PC,  i.e.,  map  colors  0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15.
               These normally are the brighter versions of the first  8  colors,
               hence bold.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       boldFont (class BoldFont)
               Specifies  the name of the bold font to use instead of overstrik&#8208;
               ing.  There is no default for this resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the  normal  font,
               otherwise it is ignored.  If only one of the normal or bold fonts
               is specified, it will be used as the normal  font  and  the  bold
               font will be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of boldMode and alwaysBoldMode resources.

       boldMode (class BoldMode)
               This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should
               be overstruck to simulate bold fonts if the resolved bold font is
               the same as the normal font.  It may be desirable to disable bold
               fonts when color is being used for the bold attribute.

               Note that xterm has one bold font which you may  set  explicitly.
               Xterm  attempts  to  derive a bold font for the other font selec&#8208;
               tions (font1 through font6).  If it cannot find a bold  font,  it
               will  use  the  normal  font.  In each case (whether the explicit
               resource or the derived font), if the normal and bold  fonts  are
               distinct, this resource has no effect.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

               See  the alwaysBoldMode resource which can modify the behavior of
               this resource.

               Although xterm attempts to derive a  bold  font  for  other  font
               selections, the font server may not cooperate.  Since X11R6, bit&#8208;
               map fonts have been scaled.  The font server  claims  to  provide
               the  bold  font that xterm requests, but the result is not always
               readable.  XFree86 introduced a feature which can be used to sup&#8208;
               press  the  scaling.  In the X server&apos;s configuration file (e.g.,
               &#8220;/etc/X11/XFree86&#8221;), you can add &#8220;:unscaled&#8221; to the  end  of  the
               directory  specification for the &#8220;misc&#8221; fonts, which comprise the
               fixed-pitch fonts that are used by xterm.  For example

                   FontPath  &quot;/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/&quot;

               would become

                   FontPath  &quot;/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled&quot;

               Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its own
               configuration  file.   The  same  &#8220;:unscaled&#8221; can be added to its
               configuration file at the end of the directory specification  for
               &#8220;misc&#8221;.

               The  bitmap  scaling  feature  is also used by xterm to implement
               VT102 double-width and double-height characters.

       brokenLinuxOSC (class BrokenLinuxOSC)
               If true, xterm applies a workaround to ignore  malformed  control
               sequences  that  a  Linux script might send.  Compare the palette
               control sequences documented in console_codes with ECMA-48.   The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       brokenSelections (class BrokenSelections)
               If  true, xterm in 8-bit mode will interpret STRING selections as
               carrying text in the current locale&apos;s encoding.  Normally  STRING
               selections  carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.  Setting this resource
               to &#8220;true&#8221; violates the ICCCM; it  may,  however,  be  useful  for
               interacting with some broken X clients.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       brokenStringTerm (class BrokenStringTerm)
               provides  a  work-around  for  some  ISDN  routers which start an
               application control string without completing it.   Set  this  to
               &#8220;true&#8221;  if  xterm appears to freeze when connecting.  The default
               is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               Xterm&apos;s state parser recognizes several types of control  strings
               which can contain text, e.g.,

               APC (Application Program Command),
               DCS (Device Control String),
               OSC (Operating System Command),
               PM (Privacy Message), and
               SOS (Start of String),

               Each  should  end  with  a string-terminator (a special character
               which cannot appear in these strings).  Ordinary control  charac&#8208;
               ters  found within the string are not ignored; they are processed
               without interfering with the process of accumulating the  control
               string&apos;s  content.  Xterm recognizes these controls in all modes,
               although some of the functions may be  suppressed  after  parsing
               the control.

               When enabled, this feature allows the user to exit from an unter&#8208;
               minated control string when any of these ordinary control charac&#8208;
               ters are found:

               control/D (used as an end of file in many shells),
               control/H (backspace),
               control/I (tab-feed),
               control/J (line feed aka newline),
               control/K (vertical tab),
               control/L (form feed),
               control/M (carriage return),
               control/N (shift-out),
               control/O (shift-in),
               control/Q (XOFF),
               control/X (cancel)

       c132 (class C132)
               Specifies  whether or not the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence, used
               to switch between 80 and 132 columns,  should  be  honored.   The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       cacheDoublesize (class CacheDoublesize)
               Tells  whether to cache double-sized fonts by xterm.  Set this to
               zero to disable double-sized fonts altogether.

       charClass (class CharClass)
               Specifies comma-separated lists of character  class  bindings  of
               the  form  [low-]high:value.  These are used in determining which
               sets of characters should be treated the same when doing cut  and
               paste.  See the CHARACTER CLASSES section.

       cjkWidth (class CjkWidth)
               Specifies  whether xterm should follow the traditional East Asian
               width convention.  When turned on,  characters  with  East  Asian
               Ambiguous  (A)  category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2.  You
               may have to set this option to &#8220;true&#8221; if you have some  old  East
               Asian terminal based programs that assume that line-drawing char&#8208;
               acters have a column width of 2.  If this resource is false,  the
               mkWidth resource controls the choice between the system&apos;s wcwidth
               and xterm&apos;s built-in tables.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       color0 (class Color0)

       color1 (class Color1)

       color2 (class Color2)

       color3 (class Color3)

       color4 (class Color4)

       color5 (class Color5)

       color6 (class Color6)

       color7 (class Color7)
               These  specify  the  colors  for  the  ISO-6429  extension.   The
               defaults  are, respectively, black, red3, green3, yellow3, a cus&#8208;
               tomizable dark blue, magenta3, cyan3, and  gray90.   The  default
               shades of color are chosen to allow the colors 8-15 to be used as
               brighter versions.

       color8 (class Color8)

       color9 (class Color9)

       color10 (class Color10)

       color11 (class Color11)

       color12 (class Color12)

       color13 (class Color13)

       color14 (class Color14)

       color15 (class Color15)
               These specify the colors for the ISO-6429 extension if  the  bold
               attribute  is  also  enabled.   The  default  resource values are
               respectively, gray30, red, green, yellow,  a  customizable  light
               blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

       color16 (class Color16)

       through

       color255 (class Color255)
               These  specify  the  colors  for  the  256-color  extension.  The
               default resource values are for colors 16 through 231 to  make  a
               6x6x6  color cube, and colors 232 through 255 to make a grayscale
               ramp.

               Resources past color15 are available as  a  compile-time  option.
               Due  to  a hardcoded limit in the X libraries on the total number
               of resources (to 400), the resources for 256-colors  are  omitted
               when wide-character support and luit are enabled.  Besides incon&#8208;
               sistent behavior if only part  of  the  resources  were  allowed,
               determining  the  exact  cutoff is difficult, and the X libraries
               tend to crash if the number of resources exceeds the limit.   The
               color  palette  is  still initialized to the same default values,
               and can be modified via control sequences.

               On the other hand, the resource limit does permit  including  the
               entire range for 88-colors.

       colorAttrMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies  whether  colorBD, colorBL, colorRV, and colorUL should
               override ANSI colors.  If not, these are displayed only  when  no
               ANSI  colors  have  been set for the corresponding position.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       colorBD (class ColorBD)
               This specifies the color to use to display bold characters if the
               &#8220;colorBDMode&#8221;  resource  is  enabled.  The default is &#8220;XtDefault&#8208;
               Foreground&#8221;.

       colorBDMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the bold  attribute  should  be
               displayed in color or as bold characters.  Note that setting col&#8208;
               orMode off disables all colors, including bold.  The  default  is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       colorBL (class ColorBL)
               This  specifies  the  color to use to display blink characters if
               the &#8220;colorBLMode&#8221; resource is enabled.   The  default  is  &#8220;XtDe&#8208;
               faultForeground&#8221;.

       colorBLMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies  whether  characters with the blink attribute should be
               displayed in color.  Note that setting colorMode off disables all
               colors, including this.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       colorMode (class ColorMode)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  recognition of ANSI (ISO-6429) color
               change escape  sequences  should  be  enabled.   The  default  is
               &#8220;true&#8221;.

       colorRV (class ColorRV)
               This  specifies the color to use to display reverse characters if
               the &#8220;colorRVMode&#8221; resource is enabled.   The  default  is  &#8220;XtDe&#8208;
               faultForeground&#8221;.

       colorRVMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the reverse attribute should be
               displayed in color.  Note that setting colorMode off disables all
               colors, including this.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       colorUL (class ColorUL)
               This  specifies the color to use to display underlined characters
               if the &#8220;colorULMode&#8221; resource is enabled.  The default is  &#8220;XtDe&#8208;
               faultForeground&#8221;.

       colorULMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies  whether characters with the underline attribute should
               be displayed in color or as  underlined  characters.   Note  that
               setting colorMode off disables all colors, including underlining.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       combiningChars (class CombiningChars)
               Specifies the number of wide-characters which can be stored in  a
               cell to overstrike (combine) with the base character of the cell.
               This can be set to values in the range 0 to 4.   The  default  is
               &#8220;2&#8221;.

       ctrlFKeys (class CtrlFKeys)
               In  VT220 keyboard mode (see sunKeyboard resource), specifies the
               amount by which to shift F1-F12 given a control modifier  (CTRL).
               This  allows  you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on a Sun/PC
               keyboard.  The default is &#8220;10&#8221;, which means that CTRL  F1  gener&#8208;
               ates the key symbol for F11.

       curses (class Curses)
               Specifies whether or not the last column bug in more(1) should be
               worked around.  See the -cu option for details.  The  default  is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       cursorBlink (class CursorBlink)
               Specifies  whether  to  make  the  cursor  blink.  The default is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       cursorColor (class CursorColor)
               Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.  The  default  is
               &#8220;XtDefaultForeground&#8221;.   By  default, xterm attempts to keep this
               color from being the same as the background color, since it draws
               the  cursor  by  filling the background of a text cell.  The same
               restriction applies to control sequences which  may  change  this
               color.

               Setting  this  resource  overrides most of xterm&apos;s adjustments to
               cursor color.  It will still use reverse-video to  disallow  some
               cases, such as a black cursor on a black background.

       cursorOffTime (class CursorOffTime)
               Specifies  the  duration  of  the  &#8220;off&#8221; part of the cursor blink
               cycle-time in milliseconds.  The same  timer  is  used  for  text
               blinking.  The default is &#8220;300&#8221;.

       cursorOnTime (class CursorOnTime)
               Specifies  the  duration  of  the  &#8220;on&#8221;  part of the cursor blink
               cycle-time, in milliseconds.  The same timer  is  used  for  text
               blinking.  The default is &#8220;600&#8221;.

       cutNewline (class CutNewline)
               If &#8220;false&#8221;, triple clicking to select a line does not include the
               Newline at the end of  the  line.   If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  the  Newline  is
               selected.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       cursorUnderLine (class CursorUnderLine)
               Specifies  whether  to  make the cursor underlined or a box.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       cutToBeginningOfLine (class CutToBeginningOfLine)
               If &#8220;false&#8221;, triple clicking to select a line  selects  only  from
               the  current  word  forward.   If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  the  entire  line  is
               selected.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       decTerminalID (class DecTerminalID)
               Specifies the emulation level (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.),  used
               to  determine  the  type  of  response  to a DA control sequence.
               Leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g., &#8220;vt100&#8221; and &#8220;100&#8221;
               are the same.  The default is &#8220;100&#8221;.

       defaultString (class DefaultString)
               Specify  the  character  (or  string) which xterm will substitute
               when pasted text includes a character which cannot be represented
               in the current encoding.  For instance, pasting UTF-8 text into a
               display of ISO-8859-1 characters will only  be  able  to  display
               codes  0-255,  while  UTF-8 text can include Unicode values above
               255.  The default is &#8220;#&#8221; (a single pound sign).

               If the undisplayable text would be double-width, xterm will add a
               space after the &#8220;#&#8221; character, to give roughly the same layout on
               the screen as the original text.

       deleteIsDEL (class DeleteIsDEL)
               Specifies whether the Delete key on  the  editing  keypad  should
               send  DEL  (127)  or the VT220-style Remove escape sequence.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;, for the latter.

       disallowedColorOps (class DisallowedColorOps)
               Specify which features  will  be  disabled  if  allowColorOps  is
               false.   This  is  a  comma-separated list of names.  The default
               value is
               SetColor,GetColor,GetAnsiColor

               The names are listed below.  xterm  ignores  capitalization,  but
               they are shown in mixed-case for clarity.

               SetColor
                    Set a specific dynamic color.

               GetColor
                    Report the current setting of a given dynamic color.

               GetAnsiColor
                    Report  the  current setting of a given ANSI color (actually
                    any of the colors set via ANSI-style controls).

       disallowedFontOps (class DisallowedFontOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowFontOps is false.
               This is a comma-separated list of names.  The default value is
               SetFont,GetFont

               The  names  are  listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but
               they are shown in mixed-case for clarity.

               SetFont
                    Set the specified font.

               GetFont
                    Report the specified font.

       disallowedTcapOps (class DisallowedTcapOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowTcapOps is false.
               This is a comma-separated list of names.  The default value is
               SetTcap,GetTcap

               The  names  are  listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but
               they are shown in mixed-case for clarity.

               SetTcap
                    (not implemented)

               GetTcap
                    Report specified function- and other special keys.

       disallowedWindowOps (class DisallowedWindowOps)
               Specify which features will  be  disabled  if  allowWindowOps  is
               false.  This is a comma-separated list of names, or (for the con&#8208;
               trols adapted from dtterm the  operation  number).   The  default
               value is
               1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,18,19,20,21,GetSelection,SetSelec&#8208;
               tion,SetWinLines,SetXprop
       (i.e. no operations are allowed).

               The names are listed below.  xterm  ignores  capitalization,  but
               they  are shown in mixed-case for clarity.  Where a number can be
               used as an alternative, it is  given  in  parentheses  after  the
               name.

               GetIconTitle (20)
                    Report xterm window&apos;s icon label as a string.

               SetXprop
                    Set X property on top-level window.

       dynamicColors (class DynamicColors)
               Specifies whether  or  not  escape  sequences  to  change  colors
               assigned to different attributes are recognized.

       eightBitControl (class EightBitControl)
               Specifies  whether  or not control sequences sent by the terminal
               should be eight-bit characters or escape sequences.  The  default
               is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       eightBitInput (class EightBitInput)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, Meta characters (a single-byte character combined with
               the Meta modifier key) input from the keyboard are presented as a
               single   character,   modified   according  to  the  eightBitMeta
               resource.  If &#8220;false&#8221;, Meta characters are converted into a  two-
               character  sequence  with  the  character itself preceded by ESC.
               The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

               The metaSendsEscape and  altSendsEscape  resources  may  override
               this  feature.   Generally  keyboards  do  not have a key labeled
               &#8220;Meta&#8221;, but &#8220;Alt&#8221; keys are common, and  they  are  conventionally
               used  for  &#8220;Meta&#8221;.   If  they were synonymous, it would have been
               reasonable to name this resource &#8220;altSendsEscape&#8221;, reversing  its
               sense.   For  more  background  on this, see the meta function in
               curses.

               Note that the Alt key is not necessarily the  same  as  the  Meta
               modifier.  xmodmap lists your key modifiers.  X defines modifiers
               for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well as 5 additional modi&#8208;
               fiers which are generally used to configure key modifiers.  xterm
               inspects the same information to  find  the  modifier  associated
               with  either  Meta  key (left or right), and uses that key as the
               Meta modifier.  It also looks for the NumLock key,  to  recognize
               the modifier which is associated with that.

               If your xmodmap configuration uses the same keycodes for Alt- and
               Meta-keys, xterm will only see  the  Alt-key  definitions,  since
               those  are tested before Meta-keys.  NumLock is tested first.  It
               is important to keep  these  keys  distinct;  otherwise  some  of
               xterm&apos;s functionality is not available.

               The eightBitInput resource is tested at startup time.  If &#8220;true&#8221;,
               the xterm tries to put the terminal into 8-bit mode.  If &#8220;false&#8221;,
               on startup, xterm tries to put the terminal into 7-bit mode.  For
               some configurations this is  unsuccessful;  failure  is  ignored.
               After  startup,  xterm does not change the terminal between 8-bit
               and 7-bit mode.

               As originally implemented in X11,  the  resource  value  did  not
               change  after  startup.  However (since patch #216 in 2006) xterm
               can modify eightBitInput after startup via  a  control  sequence.
               The  corresponding  terminfo capabilities smm (set meta mode) and
               rmm (reset meta mode) have been recognized by bash for some time.
               Interestingly  enough,  bash&apos;s notion of &quot;meta mode&quot; differs from
               the standard definition (in the terminfo manual), which describes
               the  change  to  the  eighth bit of a character.  It happens that
               bash views &quot;meta mode&quot; as  the  ESC  character  that  xterm  puts
               before  a  character  when a special meta key is pressed.  bash&apos;s
               early documentation talks about the ESC character and ignores the
               eighth bit.

       eightBitMeta (class EightBitMeta)
               This  controls the way xterm modifies the eighth bit of a single-
               byte key when the eightBitInput resource is set.  The default  is
               &#8220;locale&#8221;.

               The  resource  value  is  a  string, evaluated as a boolean after
               startup.

               false
                    The key is sent unmodified.

               locale
                    The key is modified only if the locale uses eight-bit encod&#8208;
                    ing.

               true The key is sent modified.

               never
                    The key is always sent unmodified.

               Except  for the never choice, xterm honors the terminfo capabili&#8208;
               ties smm (set meta mode) and rmm (reset meta mode), allowing  the
               feature to be turned on or off dynamically.

               If  eightBitMeta  is  enabled  when  the locale uses UTF-8, xterm
               encodes the value as UTF-8 (since patch #183 in 2003).

       eightBitOutput (class EightBitOutput)
               Specifies whether or not eight-bit characters sent from the  host
               should  be  accepted as is or stripped when printed.  The default
               is &#8220;true&#8221;, which means that they are accepted as is.

       eightBitSelectTypes (class EightBitSelectTypes)
               Override xterm&apos;s default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE)
               for  selections  in  normal (ISO-8859-1) mode.  The default is an
               empty string, i.e., &#8220;&#8221;, which does not override anything.

       faceName (class FaceName)
               Specify the pattern for scalable fonts selected from the FreeType
               library  if  support  for  that  library was compiled into xterm.
               There is no default value.

               If not specified, or if there is no match  for  both  normal  and
               bold fonts, xterm uses the bitmap font and related resources.

               It  is  possible  to  select suitable bitmap fonts using a script
               such as this:

                   #!/bin/sh
                   FONT=`xfontsel -print`
                   test -n &quot;$FONT&quot; &amp;&amp; xfd -fn &quot;$FONT&quot;

               However (even  though  xfd  accepts  a  &#8220;-fa&#8221;  option  to  denote
               FreeType  fonts), xfontsel has not been similarly extended.  As a
               workaround, you may try

                   fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family

               to find a list of scalable fixed-pitch fonts which  may  be  used
               for the faceName resource value.

       faceNameDoublesize (class FaceNameDoublesize)
               Specify  a double-width scalable font for cases where an applica&#8208;
               tion requires this, e.g.,  in  CJK  applications.   There  is  no
               default value.

               If  the application uses double-wide characters and this resource
               is not given, xterm will use a scaled version of the  font  given
               by faceName.

       faceSize (class FaceSize)
               Specify  the  pointsize  for  fonts  selected  from  the FreeType
               library if support for that library was compiled into xterm.  The
               default  is  &#8220;14.0&#8221; On the VT Fonts menu, this corresponds to the
               Default entry.

               Although the default is &#8220;14.0&#8221;, this may not be the same  as  the
               pointsize  for  the default bitmap font, i.e., that assigned with
               the -fn option, or the font resource.  For example,  the  &#8220;fixed&#8221;
               font  usually  has  a pointsize of &#8220;8.0&#8221;.  If you set faceSize to
               match the size of the bitmap font, then switching between  bitmap
               and  TrueType  fonts via the font menu will give comparable sizes
               for the window.

               You can specify the pointsize for TrueType  fonts  selected  with
               the  other  size-related menu entries such as Medium, Huge, etc.,
               by using one of the following resource values.   If  you  do  not
               specify a value, they default to &#8220;0.0&#8221;, which causes xterm to use
               the ratio of  font  sizes  from  the  corresponding  bitmap  font
               resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.

               If  all  of  the  faceSize resources are set, then xterm will use
               this information to determine the  next  smaller/larger  TrueType
               font  for the larger-vt-font() and smaller-vt-font() actions.  If
               any are not set, xterm will use only  the  areas  of  the  bitmap
               fonts.

       faceSize1 (class FaceSize1)
               Specifies the pointsize of the first alternative font.

       faceSize2 (class FaceSize2)
               Specifies the pointsize of the second alternative font.

       faceSize3 (class FaceSize3)
               Specifies the pointsize of the third alternative font.

       faceSize4 (class FaceSize4)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fourth alternative font.

       faceSize5 (class FaceSize5)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fifth alternative font.

       faceSize6 (class FaceSize6)
               Specifies the pointsize of the sixth alternative font.

       font (class Font)
               Specifies the name of the normal font.  The default is &#8220;fixed&#8221;.

               See  the  discussion  of the locale resource, which describes how
               this font may be overridden.

               NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as

                   *font: fixed

               which are overly broad, affecting both

                   xterm.vt100.font

               and

                   xterm.vt100.utf8Fonts.font

               which is probably not what you intended.

       fastScroll (class FastScroll)
               Modifies the effect of jump scroll  (jumpScroll)  by  suppressing
               screen  refreshes  for the special case when output to the screen
               has completely shifted the contents  off-screen.   For  instance,
               cat&apos;ing a large file to the screen does this.

       font1 (class Font1)
               Specifies the name of the first alternative font.

       font2 (class Font2)
               Specifies the name of the second alternative font.
&#12;       font3 (class Font3)
               Specifies the name of the third alternative font.

       font4 (class Font4)
               Specifies the name of the fourth alternative font.

       font5 (class Font5)
               Specifies the name of the fifth alternative font.

       font6 (class Font6)
               Specifies the name of the sixth alternative font.

       fontDoublesize (class FontDoublesize)
               Specifies  whether  xterm  should  attempt to use font scaling to
               draw double-sized characters.  Some older font servers cannot  do
               this  properly, will return misleading font metrics.  The default
               is &#8220;true&#8221;.  If disabled, xterm will simulate double-sized charac&#8208;
               ters by drawing normal characters with spaces between them.

       fontWarnings (class FontWarnings)
               Specify  whether xterm should report an error if it fails to load
               a font:

               0    Never report an error (though the X libraries may).

               1    Report an error if the font name was  given  as  a  resource
                    setting.

               2    Always report an error on failure to load a font.

               The default is &#8220;1&#8221;.

       forceBoxChars (class ForceBoxChars)
               Specifies  whether  xterm should assume the normal and bold fonts
               have VT100 line-drawing characters:

               -    The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by xterm  nor&#8208;
                    mally  have  the  VT100  line-drawing  glyphs in cells 1-31.
                    Other fixed-pitch fonts may be  more  attractive,  but  lack
                    these glyphs.

               -    When using an ISO-10646-1 font and the wideChars resource is
                    true, xterm uses the Unicode glyphs which  match  the  VT100
                    line-drawing glyphs.

               If &#8220;false&#8221;, xterm checks for missing glyphs in the font and makes
               line-drawing characters directly as  needed.   If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  xterm
               assumes  the  font  does not contain the line-drawing characters,
               and draws them directly.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       forcePackedFont (class ForcePackedFont)
               Specifies whether xterm should use the maximum or  minimum  glyph
               width when displaying using a bitmap font.  Use the maximum width
               to help with proportional fonts.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;, denoting
               the minimum width.

       foreground (class Foreground)
               Specifies  the  color  to  use for displaying text in the window.
               Setting the class name instead of the instance name  is  an  easy
               way  to  have  everything  that would normally appear in the text
               color change color.  The default is &#8220;XtDefaultForeground&#8221;.

       formatOtherKeys (class FormatOtherKeys)
               Overrides the format of the escape sequence used to report  modi&#8208;
               fied keys with the modifyOtherKeys resource.

               0  send   modified   keys   as  parameters  for  function-key  27
                  (default).

               1  send modified keys as parameters for CSI u.

       freeBoldBox (class FreeBoldBox)
               Specifies whether xterm should assume the bounding boxes for nor&#8208;
               mal  and  bold  fonts are compatible.  If &#8220;false&#8221;, xterm compares
               them and will reject choices of bold fonts that do not match  the
               size  of  the  normal  font.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;, which means
               that the comparison is performed.

       geometry (class Geometry)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of  the  VT102  window.
               There is no default for this resource.

       highlightColor (class HighlightColor)
               Specifies  the color to use for the background of selected (high&#8208;
               lighted) text.  If not  specified  (i.e.,  matching  the  default
               foreground),  reverse  video is used.  The default is &#8220;XtDefault&#8208;
               Foreground&#8221;.

       highlightColorMode (class HighlightColorMode)
               Specifies whether xterm should use highlightTextColor  and  high&#8208;
               lightColor  to override the reversed foreground/background colors
               in a selection.  The default is unspecified:  at  startup,  xterm
               checks  if  those  resources  are set to something other than the
               default foreground and background colors.  Setting this  resource
               disables the check.

               The  following  table  shows  the interaction of the highlighting
               resources, abbreviated as shown to fit in this page:

       highlightReverse (class HighlightReverse)
               Specifies  whether  xterm should reverse the selection foreground
               and background colors  when  selecting  text  with  reverse-video
               attribute.   This  applies  only  to the highlightColor and high&#8208;
               lightTextColor resources, e.g., to  match  the  color  scheme  of
               xwsh.   If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  xterm reverses the colors, If &#8220;false&#8221;, xterm
               does not reverse colors, The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       highlightSelection (class HighlightSelection)
               If &#8220;false&#8221;, selecting with the mouse highlights all positions  on
               the screen between the beginning of the selection and the current
               position.  If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm highlights only  the  positions  that
               contain text that can be selected.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               Depending on the way your applications write to the screen, there
               may be trailing blanks on a line.  Xterm stores  data  as  it  is
               shown  on  the  screen.  Erasing the display changes the internal
               state of each cell so it is not considered a blank for  the  pur&#8208;
               pose  of  selection.   Blanks  written  since  the last erase are
               selectable.  If you do not wish to  have  trailing  blanks  in  a
               selection, use the trimSelection resource.

       highlightTextColor (class HighlightTextColor)
               Specifies  the color to use for the foreground of selected (high&#8208;
               lighted) text.  If not  specified  (i.e.,  matching  the  default
               background),  reverse  video is used.  The default is &#8220;XtDefault&#8208;
               Background&#8221;.

       hpLowerleftBugCompat (class HpLowerleftBugCompat)
               Specifies whether to work around a bug in HP&apos;s xdb, which ignores
               termcap  and always sends ESC F to move to the lower left corner.
               &#8220;true&#8221; causes xterm to interpret ESC F as a request  to  move  to
               the lower left corner of the screen.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       i18nSelections (class I18nSelections)
               If  false,  xterm  will  not request the targets COMPOUND_TEXT or
               TEXT.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;. It may be set to false in order  to
               work around ICCCM violations by other X clients.

       iconBorderColor (class BorderColor)
               Specifies  the  border  color  for the active icon window if this
               feature is compiled into xterm.  Not  all  window  managers  will
               make the icon border visible.

       iconBorderWidth (class BorderWidth)
               Specifies  the  border  width  for the active icon window if this
               feature is compiled into xterm.  The default  is  &#8220;2&#8221;.   Not  all
               window managers will make the border visible.

       iconFont (class IconFont)
               Specifies  the font for the miniature active icon window, if this
               feature is compiled into xterm.  The default is &#8220;nil2&#8221;.

       initialFont (class InitialFont)
               Specifies which of the VT100 fonts to use initially.  Values  are
               the  same  as  for  the  set-vt-font action.  The default is &#8220;d&#8221;,
               i.e., &#8220;default&#8221;.

       inputMethod (class XtCInputMethod)
               Tells xterm which type of input  method  to  use.   There  is  no
               default method.

       internalBorder (class BorderWidth)
               Specifies  the  number  of  pixels between the characters and the
               window border.  The default is &#8220;2&#8221;.

       italicULMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the underline attribute  should
               be  displayed  in an italic font or as underlined characters.  It
               is implemented only for TrueType fonts.

       jumpScroll (class JumpScroll)
               Specifies whether or not jump scroll should be used.  This corre&#8208;
               sponds to the VT102 DECSCLM private mode.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.
               See fastScroll for a variation.

       keepSelection (class KeepSelection)
               Specifies whether xterm will keep the selection  even  after  the
               selected  area  was  touched by some output to the terminal.  The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       keyboardDialect (class KeyboardDialect)
               Specifies the initial keyboard dialect, as well  as  the  default
               value when the terminal is reset.  The value given is the same as
               the final character in the control sequences which change charac&#8208;
               ter sets.  The default is &#8220;B&#8221;, which corresponds to US ASCII.
&#12;       nameKeymap (class NameKeymap)
               See the discussion of the keymap() action.

       limitResize (class LimitResize)
               Limits  resizing  of  the  screen via control sequence to a given
               multiple of the display dimensions.  The default is &#8220;1&#8221;.

       locale (class Locale)
               Specifies how to use luit, an encoding  converter  between  UTF-8
               and locale encodings.  The resource value (ignoring case) may be:

               true
                   xterm  will use the encoding specified by the users&apos; LC_CTYPE
                   locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG variables) as far  as
                   possible.  This is realized by always enabling UTF-8 mode and
                   invoking luit in non-UTF-8 locales.

               medium
                   xterm will follow users&apos; LC_CTYPE locale only for UTF-8, east
                   Asian,  and  Thai  locales, where the encodings were not sup&#8208;
                   ported by conventional 8bit mode with  changing  fonts.   For
                   other locales, xterm will use conventional 8bit mode.

               checkfont
                   If  mini-luit  is  compiled-in, xterm will check if a Unicode
                   font has been specified.  If so, it checks if  the  character
                   encoding for the current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or Latin-9,
                   uses the appropriate mapping to support those with  the  Uni&#8208;
                   code  font.   For  other  encodings, xterm assumes that UTF-8
                   encoding is required.

               false
                   xterm will use conventional 8bit mode or UTF-8 mode according
                   to utf8 resource or -u8 option.

               Any  other  value, e.g., &#8220;UTF-8&#8221; or &#8220;ISO8859-2&#8221;, is assumed to be
               an encoding name; luit will be invoked to support  the  encoding.
               The  actual  list  of  supported  encodings depends on luit.  The
               default is &#8220;medium&#8221;.

               Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need  an  ISO-10646-1
               font  to  display the result.  Your configuration may not include
               this font, or locale-support by xterm  may  not  be  needed.   At
               startup,  xterm  uses  a  mechanism  equivalent  to  the load-vt-
               fonts(utf8Fonts, Utf8Fonts) action to load font name subresources
               of  the  VT100  widget.   That  is,  resource  patterns  such  as
               &#8220;*vt100.utf8Fonts.font&#8221; will be loaded, and (if this resource  is
               enabled),  override  the  normal  fonts.   If no subresources are
               found, the normal fonts such as &#8220;*vt100.font&#8221;,  etc.,  are  used.
               The  resource files distributed with xterm use ISO-10646-1 fonts,
               but do not rely on them unless you are using  the  locale  mecha&#8208;
               nism.

       localeFilter (class LocaleFilter)
               Specifies the file name for the encoding converter from/to locale
               encodings and UTF-8 which is used with the -lc option  or  locale
               resource.   The  help  message  shown  by &#8220;xterm -help&#8221; lists the
               default value, which depends on your system configuration.

               If the encoding converter requires command-line  parameters,  you
               can add those after the command, e.g.,

                   *localeFilter: xterm-filter -p

               Alternatively,  you may put those parameter within a shell script
               to execute the converter, and set this resource to point  to  the
               shell script.

       loginShell (class LoginShell)
               Specifies whether or not the shell to be run in the window should
               be started as a login shell.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       marginBell (class MarginBell)
               Specifies whether or not the bell should be rung  when  the  user
               types near the right margin.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       metaSendsEscape (class MetaSendsEscape)
               If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  Meta  characters (a character combined with the Meta
               modifier key) are converted into a  two-character  sequence  with
               the  character  itself  preceded by ESC.  This applies as well to
               function key control sequences, unless xterm sees  that  Meta  is
               used in your key translations.  If &#8220;false&#8221;, Meta characters input
               from the keyboard are  handled  according  to  the  eightBitInput
               resource.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       mkSamplePass (class MkSamplePass)
               If mkSampleSize is nonzero, and mkWidth (and cjkWidth) are false,
               on startup xterm compares its built-in  tables  to  the  system&apos;s
               wide  character  width data to decide if it will use the system&apos;s
               data.  It tests the  first  mkSampleSize  character  values,  and
               allows  up to mkSamplePass mismatches before the test fails.  The
               default (for the allowed number of mismatches) is 256.

       mkSampleSize (class MkSampleSize)
               With mkSamplePass, this specifies a startup test  used  for  ini&#8208;
               tializing wide character width calculations.  The default (number
               of characters to check) is 1024.

       mkWidth (class MkWidth)
               Specifies whether xterm should use a built-in version of the wide
               character  width  calculation.   See  also  the cjkWidth resource
               which can override this.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               Here is a summary of the resources which control  the  choice  of
               wide character width calculation:

               l    l   l   _   _   _   l   l   l.    cjkWidth  mkWidth   Action
               false     false     use system  tables  subject  to  mkSamplePass
               false     true use  built-in  tables  true false     use built-in
               CJK tables true true use built-in CJK tables

       modifyCursorKeys (class ModifyCursorKeys)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt-
               or  Meta-modifiers  are  used  to  add  a parameter to the escape
               sequence returned by a cursor-key.  The default is &#8220;2&#8221;:

               Set it to -1 to disable it.
               Set it to 0 to use the old/obsolete behavior.
               Set it to 1 to prefix modified sequences with CSI.
               Set it to 2 to force the modifier to be the second  parameter  if
               it would otherwise be the first.
               Set  it  to  3 to mark the sequence with a &#8220;&gt;&#8221; to hint that it is
               private.

       modifyFunctionKeys (class ModifyFunctionKeys)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt-
               or  Meta-modifiers  are  used  to  add  a parameter to the escape
               sequence returned by a (numbered) function-key.  The  default  is
               &#8220;2&#8221;.  The resource values are similar to modifyCursorKeys:

               Set  it  to -1 to permit the user to use shift- and control-modi&#8208;
               fiers to construct function-key strings using the normal encoding
               scheme.
               Set it to 0 to use the old/obsolete behavior.
               Set it to 1 to prefix modified sequences with CSI.
               Set  it  to 2 to force the modifier to be the second parameter if
               it would otherwise be the first.
               Set it to 3 to mark the sequence with a &#8220;&gt;&#8221; to hint  that  it  is
               private.

               If modifyFunctionKeys is zero, xterm uses Control- and Shift-mod&#8208;
               ifiers to allow the  user  to  construct  numbered  function-keys
               beyond the set provided by the keyboard:

               Control
                    adds the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.

               Shift
                    adds twice the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.
&#12;               Control/Shift
                    adds three times the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.

               As a special case, legacy (when oldFunctionKeys is true) or vt220
               (when sunKeyboard is true) keyboards interpret only the  Control-
               modifier  when constructing numbered function-keys.  This is done
               to provide compatible keyboards for DEC VT220 and related  termi&#8208;
               nals that implement user-defined keys (UDK).

       modifyOtherKeys (class ModifyOtherKeys)
               Like   modifyCursorKeys,  tells  xterm  to  construct  an  escape
               sequence for other keys (such as &#8220;2&#8221;) when modified by  Control-,
               Alt-  or Meta-modifiers.  This feature does not apply to function
               keys and well-defined keys such as ESC or the control keys.   The
               default is &#8220;0&#8221;:

               0    disables this feature.

               1    enables  this  feature  for keys except for those with well-
                    known behavior, e.g., Tab, Backarrow and some  special  con&#8208;
                    trol character cases, e.g., Control-Space to make a NUL.

               2    enables  this  feature  for  keys  including  the exceptions
                    listed.

       multiClickTime (class MultiClickTime)
               Specifies the maximum time in  milliseconds  between  multi-click
               select events.  The default is &#8220;250&#8221; milliseconds.

       multiScroll (class MultiScroll)
               Specifies whether or not scrolling should be done asynchronously.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       nMarginBell (class Column)
               Specifies the number of characters from the right margin at which
               the  margin  bell  should be rung, when enabled by the marginBell
               resource.  The default is &#8220;10&#8221;.

       numLock (class NumLock)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm checks if NumLock is used  as  a  modifier  (see
               xmodmap(1)).   If so, this modifier is used to simplify the logic
               when implementing special NumLock for the  sunKeyboard  resource.
               Also  (when  sunKeyboard is false), similar logic is used to find
               the modifier associated with the left and right  Alt  keys.   The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       oldXtermFKeys (class OldXtermFKeys)
               If  &#8220;true&#8221;,  xterm will use old-style control sequences for func&#8208;
               tion keys F1 to F4, for compatibility with  X  Consortium  xterm.
               Otherwise,  it  uses  the  VT100-style codes for PF1 to PF4.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       on2Clicks (class On2Clicks)

       on3Clicks (class On3Clicks)

       on4Clicks (class On4Clicks)

       on5Clicks (class On5Clicks)
               Specify selection behavior in response to multiple mouse  clicks.
               A  single  mouse  click is always interpreted as described in the
               SELECTION section (see POINTER  USAGE).   Multiple  mouse  clicks
               (using  the  button  which activates the select-start action) are
               interpreted according to the resource values of  on2Clicks,  etc.
               The resource value can be one of these:

               word
                  Select  a &#8220;word&#8221; as determined by the charClass resource.  See
                  the CHARACTER CLASSES section.

               line
                  Select a line (counting wrapping).

               group
                  Select a group of adjacent  lines  (counting  wrapping).   The
                  selection  stops  on a blank line, and does not extend outside
                  the current page.

               page
                  Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.

               all
                  Select all lines, i.e., including the saved lines.

               regex
                  Select a &#8220;word&#8221; as determined by the regular expression  which
                  follows in the resource value.

               none
                  No  selection  action is associated with this resource.  xterm
                  interprets it as the end of the list.  For  example,  you  may
                  use  it  to  disable  triple  (and higher) clicking by setting
                  on3Clicks to &#8220;none&#8221;.

               The default values for on2Clicks and  on3Clicks  are  &#8220;word&#8221;  and
               &#8220;line&#8221;, respectively.  There is no default value for on4Clicks or
               on5Clicks, making those inactive.  On startup,  xterm  determines
               the  maximum  number  of  clicks by the onXClicks resource values
               which are set.

       openIm (class XtCOpenIm)
               Tells xterm whether to open the input  method  at  startup.   The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       pointerColor (class PointerColor)
               Specifies  the  foreground  color of the pointer.  The default is
               &#8220;XtDefaultForeground&#8221;.

       pointerColorBackground (class PointerColorBackground)
               Specifies the background color of the pointer.   The  default  is
               &#8220;XtDefaultBackground&#8221;.

       pointerMode (class PointerMode)
               Specifies  when  the pointer may be hidden as the user types.  It
               will be redisplayed if the user moves the mouse, or clicks one of
               its buttons.

               0  never

               1  the application running in xterm has not activated mouse mode.
                  This is the default.

               2  always.

       pointerShape (class Cursor)
               Specifies the name of the shape of the pointer.  The  default  is
               &#8220;xterm&#8221;.

       popOnBell (class PopOnBell)
               Specifies  whether  the  window would be raised when Control-G is
               received.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               If the window is iconified, this has  no  effect.   However,  the
               zIconBeep  resource  provides  you  with the ability to see which
               iconified windows have sounded a bell.

       preeditType (class XtCPreeditType)
               Tells xterm which types of preedit (preconversion) string to dis&#8208;
               play.  The default is &#8220;OverTheSpot,Root&#8221;.

       printAttributes (class PrintAttributes)
               Specifies  whether  to  print  graphic  attributes along with the
               text.  A real DEC VTxxx terminal will print the underline,  high&#8208;
               lighting codes but your printer may not handle these.

               &#183;   &#8220;0&#8221; disables the attributes.

               &#183;   &#8220;1&#8221;  prints  the  normal  set of attributes (bold, underline,
                   inverse and blink) as VT100-style control sequences.

               &#183;   &#8220;2&#8221; prints ANSI color attributes as well.
&#12;               The default is &#8220;1&#8221;.

       printFileImmediate (PrintFileImmediate)
               When the print-immediate action  is  invoked,  xterm  prints  the
               screen  contents  directly  to  a file.  Set this resource to the
               prefix of the filename (a  timestamp  will  be  appended  to  the
               actual name).

               The  default  is  an  empty  string,  i.e., &#8220;&#8221;, However, when the
               print-immediate action is invoked, if the string is  empty,  then
               &#8220;XTerm&#8221; is used.

       printFileOnXError (PrintFileOnXError)
               If  xterm  exits with an X error, e.g., your connection is broken
               when the server crashes, it can be told to write the contents  of
               the  screen  to a file.  To enable the feature, set this resource
               to the prefix of the filename (a timestamp will  be  appended  to
               the actual name).

               The  default  is  an  empty string, i.e., &#8220;&#8221;, which disables this
               feature.  However, when the print-on-error action is invoked,  if
               the string is empty, then &#8220;XTermError&#8221; is used.

               These  error  codes are handled: ERROR_XERROR, ERROR_XIOERROR and
               ERROR_ICEERROR.

       printModeImmediate (PrintModeImmediate)
               When the print-immediate action  is  invoked,  xterm  prints  the
               screen contents directly to a file.  You can use the printModeIm&#8208;
               mediate resource to tell it to use  escape  sequences  to  recon&#8208;
               struct  the video attributes and colors.  This uses the same val&#8208;
               ues as the printAttributes resource.  The default is &#8220;0&#8221;.

       printModeOnXError (PrintModeOnXError)
               Xterm implements the printFileOnXError feature using the  printer
               feature,  although the output is written directly to a file.  You
               can use the printModeOnXError resource to tell it to  use  escape
               sequences  to  reconstruct the video attributes and colors.  This
               uses the  same  values  as  the  printAttributes  resource.   The
               default is &#8220;0&#8221;.

       printOptsImmediate (PrintOptsImmediate)
               Specify  the  range  of  text which is printed to a file when the
               print-immediately action is invoked.

               &#183;   If zero (0), then this selects the current  (visible  screen)
                   plus the saved lines, except if the alternate screen is being
                   used.  In that case, only the alternate screen is selectd.

               &#183;   If nonzero, the bits  of  this  resource  value  (checked  in
                   descending order) select the range:

                   8  selects the saved lines.

                   4  selects the alternate screen.

                   2  selects the normal screen.

                   1  selects the current screen, which can be either the normal
                      or alternate screen.

               The default is &#8220;9&#8221;, which selects the current visible screen plus
               saved lines, with no special case for the alternated screen.

       printOptsOnXError (PrintOptsOnXError)
               Specify  the  range  of  text which is printed to a file when the
               print-on-error action is invoked.  The resource value  is  inter&#8208;
               preted the same as in printOptsImmediate.

               The default is &#8220;9&#8221;, which selects the current visible screen plus
               saved lines, with no special case for the alternated screen.

       printerAutoClose (class PrinterAutoClose)
               If &#8220;true&#8221;, xterm will close the printer (a pipe) when the  appli&#8208;
               cation  switches  the  printer offline with a Media Copy command.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       printerCommand (class PrinterCommand)
               Specifies a shell command to which xterm will open  a  pipe  when
               the  first  MC (Media Copy) command is initiated.  The default is
               an empty string, i.e., &#8220;&#8221;.  If the resource value is given as  an
               empty string, the printer is disabled.

       printerControlMode (class PrinterControlMode)
               Specifies  the  printer  control  mode.   A &#8220;1&#8221; selects autoprint
               mode, which causes xterm to print a line from the screen when you
               move the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed or ver&#8208;
               tical tab character, or an autowrap occurs.   Autoprint  mode  is
               overridden  by  printer controller mode (a &#8220;2&#8221;), which causes all
               of the output to be directed to the printer.  The default is &#8220;0&#8221;.

       printerExtent (class PrinterExtent)
               Controls whether a print page function will print the entire page
               (true),  or  only  the  the  portion within the scrolling margins
               (false).  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       printerFormFeed (class PrinterFormFeed)
               Controls whether a form feed is sent to the printer at the end of
               a print page function.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       printerNewLine (class PrinterNewLine)
               Controls whether a newline is sent to the printer at the end of a
               print page function.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       quietGrab (class QuietGrab)
               Controls whether the cursor  is  repainted  when  NotifyGrab  and
               NotifyUngrab  event  types  are  received during change of focus.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       renderFont (class RenderFont)
               If xterm is built with the Xft library, this controls whether the
               faceName resource is used.  The default is &#8220;default&#8221;.

               The  resource  values  are  strings,  evaluated as booleans after
               startup.

               false
                    disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

               true
                    startup using the TrueType font specified  by  the  faceName
                    and  faceSize  resource  settings.  If there is no value for
                    faceName, disable the feature and use  the  normal  (bitmap)
                    font.

                    After  startup, you can still switch to/from the bitmap font
                    using the &#8220;TrueType Fonts&#8221; menu entry.

               default
                    startup using the  normal  (bitmap)  font,  but  enable  the
                    &#8220;TrueType  Fonts&#8221;  menu  entry  to  allow  runtime switching
                    to/from TrueType fonts.

                    If there is no faceName resource set, then runtime switching
                    to  TrueType  fonts is disabled.  Xterm has a separate  com&#8208;
                    piled-in value for faceName for the special case where  ren&#8208;
                    derFont is &#8220;default&#8221;.  That is normally &#8220;mono&#8221;.

       resizeGravity (class ResizeGravity)
               Affects  the  behavior when the window is resized to be taller or
               shorter.  NorthWest specifies that the top line of  text  on  the
               screen  stay  fixed.   If  the  window is made shorter, lines are
               dropped from the bottom; if the  window  is  made  taller,  blank
               lines  are  added  at  the  bottom.   This is compatible with the
               behavior in R4.  SouthWest (the default) specifies that the  bot&#8208;
               tom line of text on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is made
               taller, additional saved lines will be  scrolled  down  onto  the
               screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off
               the top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped.

       retryInputMethod (class XtCRetryInputMethod)
               Tells xterm how many times to retry,  in  case  the  input-method
               server  is not responding.  This is a different issue than unsup&#8208;
               ported preedit type, etc.  You may encounter retries  if  your  X
               configuration  (and  its  libraries) are missing pieces.  Setting
               this resource to  zero  ``0&apos;&apos;  will  cancel  the  retrying.   The
               default is ``3&apos;&apos;.

       reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo)
               Specifies  whether or not reverse video should be simulated.  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

               There are several aspects to reverse video in xterm:

               &#183;   The command-line -rv option tells the X libraries to  reverse
                   the  foreground  and background colors.  Xterm&apos;s command-line
                   options set resource values.  In particular,  the  X  Toolkit
                   sets the reverseVideo resource when the -rv option is used.

               &#183;   If  the user has also used command-line options -fg or -bg to
                   set the foreground and background colors, xterm does not  see
                   these  options  directly.   Instead, it examines the resource
                   values to reconstruct the command-line options, and determine
                   which  of  the colors is the user&apos;s intended foreground, etc.
                   Their actual values are irrelevant to the reverse video func&#8208;
                   tion; some users prefer the X defaults (black text on a white
                   background), others prefer white text on a black background.

               &#183;   After startup, the user can toggle the &#8220;Enable Reverse Video&#8221;
                   menu  entry.  This exchanges the current foreground and back&#8208;
                   ground colors of the VT100 widget, and repaints  the  screen.
                   Because   of  the  X  resource  hierarchy,  the  reverseVideo
                   resource applies to more than the VT100 widget.

               Programs running in an xterm can also use  control  sequences  to
               enable  the  VT100  reverse video mode.  These are independent of
               the reverseVideo resource and the menu  entry.   Xterm  exchanges
               the  current  foreground  and background colors when drawing text
               affected by these control sequences.

               Other control sequences can alter the foreground  and  background
               colors which are used:

               &#183;   Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to set
                   the foreground and background colors.

               &#183;   Extensions to the ANSI color controls (such as  16-,  88-  or
                   256-colors) are treated similarly to the ANSI control.

               &#183;   Using other control sequences (the &#8220;dynamic colors&#8221; feature),
                   a program can change the foreground and background colors.

       reverseWrap (class ReverseWrap)
               Specifies whether or not reverse-wraparound  should  be  enabled.
               This  corresponds  to  xterm&apos;s  private  mode 45.  The default is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       rightScrollBar (class RightScrollBar)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed on the
               right rather than the left.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       saveLines (class SaveLines)
               Specifies  the  number  of  lines  to  save beyond the top of the
               screen when a scrollbar is turned on.  The default is &#8220;64&#8221;.

       scrollBar (class ScrollBar)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed.   The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       scrollBarBorder (class ScrollBarBorder)
               Specifies  the  width of the scrollbar border.  Note that this is
               drawn to overlap the border of the xterm window.   Modifying  the
               scrollbar&apos;s border affects only the line between the VT100 widget
               and the scrollbar.  The default value is 1.

       scrollKey (class ScrollCond)
               Specifies whether or not  pressing  a  key  should  automatically
               cause  the scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling region.
               This corresponds to xterm&apos;s private mode 1011.   The  default  is
               &#8220;false&#8221;.

       scrollLines (class ScrollLines)
               Specifies  the  number  of lines that the scroll-back and scroll-
               forw actions should use as a default.  The default value is 1.

       scrollTtyOutput (class ScrollCond)
               Specifies whether or not output to the terminal should  automati&#8208;
               cally  cause  the  scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling
               region.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       selectToClipboard (class SelectToClipboard)
               Tells xterm whether to use the PRIMARY or  CLIPBOARD  for  SELECT
               tokens  in  the  selection  mechanism.  The set-select action can
               change this at runtime, allowing the user to work  with  programs
               that  handle  only  one  of  these  mechanisms.   The  default is
               &#8220;false&#8221;, which tells it to use PRIMARY.

       shiftFonts (class ShiftFonts)
               Specifies whether to  enable  the  actions  larger-vt-font()  and
               smaller-vt-font(), which are normally bound to the shifted KP_Add
               and KP_Subtract.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       showBlinkAsBold (class ShowBlinkAsBold)
               Tells xterm whether to display text with blink-attribute the same
               as  bold.   If  xterm has not been configured to support blinking
               text, the default is &#8220;true&#8221;, which corresponds to older  versions
               of xterm, otherwise the default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       showMissingGlyphs (class ShowMissingGlyphs)
               Tells  xterm  whether  to  display a box outlining places where a
               character has been used that the font does  not  represent.   The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       showWrapMarks (class ShowWrapMarks)
               For  debugging  xterm  and  applications  that may manipulate the
               wrapped-line flag by writing text at the  right  margin,  show  a
               mark  on  the  right  inner-border of the window.  The mark shows
               which lines have the flag set.

       signalInhibit (class SignalInhibit)
               Specifies whether or not the entries in the &#8220;Main  Options&#8221;  menu
               for  sending  signals to xterm should be disallowed.  The default
               is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       tekGeometry (class Geometry)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the  Tektronix  win&#8208;
               dow.  There is no default for this resource.

       tekInhibit (class TekInhibit)
               Specifies  whether  or not the escape sequence to enter Tektronix
               mode should be ignored.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       tekSmall (class TekSmall)
               Specifies whether or not the Tektronix mode window  should  start
               in  its  smallest size if no explicit geometry is given.  This is
               useful when running xterm on displays with  small  screens.   The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       tekStartup (class TekStartup)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should start up in Tektronix mode.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       tiXtraScroll (class TiXtraScroll)
               Specifies whether xterm should scroll to a new page when process&#8208;
               ing  the  ti  termcap  entry, i.e., the private modes 47, 1047 or
               1049.  This is only in effect if titeInhibit is  &#8220;true&#8221;,  because
               the  intent  of  this option is to provide a picture of the full-
               screen application&apos;s display on the scrollback without wiping out
               the  text that would be shown before the application was initial&#8208;
               ized.  The default for this resource is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       titeInhibit (class TiteInhibit)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should remove ti  and  te  termcap
               entries  (used  to switch between alternate screens on startup of
               many screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string.  If  set,
               xterm also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the alternate
               screen.  Xterm supports terminfo in a different  way,  supporting
               composite  control  sequences (also known as private modes) 1047,
               1048 and 1049 which have the same effect as the original 47  con&#8208;
               trol sequence.  The default for this resource is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       titleModes (class TitleModes)
               Tells  xterm  whether to accept or return window- and icon-labels
               in ISO-8859-1 (the default) or UTF-8.  Either can be  encoded  in
               hexadecimal.  The default for this resource is &#8220;0&#8221;.

               Each  bit  (bit &#8220;0&#8221; is 1, bit &#8220;1&#8221; is 2, etc.)  corresponds to one
               of the parameters set by the title modes control sequence:

               0    Set window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               1    Query window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               2    Set window/icon labels  using  UTF-8  (overrides  utf8Titles
                    resource).

               3    Query window/icon labels using UTF-8

       translations (class Translations)
               Specifies  the  key  and  button  bindings for menus, selections,
               &#8220;programmed strings&#8221;, etc.  The translations resource, which pro&#8208;
               vides  much  of  xterm&apos;s  configurability,  is a feature of the X
               Toolkit Intrinsics library (Xt).  See the ACTIONS section.

       trimSelection (class TrimSelection)
               If you set highlightSelection, you can  see  the  text  which  is
               selected, including any trailing spaces.  Clearing the screen (or
               a line) resets it to a state containing no  spaces.   Some  lines
               may  contain  trailing  spaces when an application writes them to
               the screen.  However, you may not wish to paste lines with trail&#8208;
               ing  spaces.   If this resource is true, xterm will trim trailing
               spaces from text which is selected.  It does  not  affect  spaces
               which  result  in  a  wrapped line, nor will it trim the trailing
               newline from your selection.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       underLine (class UnderLine)
               This specifies whether or not text with the  underline  attribute
               should be underlined.  It may be desirable to disable underlining
               when color is  being  used  for  the  underline  attribute.   The
               default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       useClipping (class UseClipping)
               Tell  xterm  whether  to use clipping to keep from producing dots
               outside the text drawing area.  Originally used  to  work  around
               for  overstriking  effects, this is also needed to work with some
               incorrectly-sized fonts.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;.

       utf8 (class Utf8)
               This specifies whether xterm will run in UTF-8 mode.  If you  set
               this  resource, xterm also sets the wideChars resource as a side-
               effect.  The resource can be set via the menu entry &#8220;UTF-8 Encod&#8208;
               ing&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;default&#8221;.

               Xterm  accepts  either  a  keyword  (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially off.  The command-line option +u8 sets
                  the  resource  to  this  value.   Escape sequences for turning
                  UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               true (1)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially  on.   Escape  sequences  for  turning
                  UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               always (2)
                  The  command-line  option -u8 sets the resource to this value.
                  Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are ignored.

               default (3)
                  This is the default value of the resource.  It is changed dur&#8208;
                  ing  initialization  depending  on whether the locale resource
                  was set, to false (0) or always (2).  See the locale  resource
                  for additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales.

               If you want to set the value of utf8, it should be in this range.
               Other nonzero values are treated the same  as  &#8220;1&#8221;,  i.e.,  UTF-8
               mode is initially on, and escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode
               on/off are allowed.

       utf8Fonts (class Utf8Fonts)
               See the  discussion  of  the  locale  resource.   This  specifies
               whether  xterm  will  use UTF-8 fonts specified via resource pat&#8208;
               terns such  as  &#8220;*vt100.utf8Fonts.font&#8221;  or  normal  (ISO-8859-1)
               fonts  via  patterns  such as &#8220;*vt100.font&#8221;.  The resource can be
               set via the menu entry &#8220;UTF-8 Fonts&#8221;.  The default is &#8220;default&#8221;.

               Xterm accepts either a keyword  (ignoring  case)  or  the  number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Use  the  ISO-8859-1  fonts.   The  menu entry is enabled,
                      allowing the choice of fonts to be changed at runtime.

               true (1)
                      Use the UTF-8 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled,  allowing
                      the choice of fonts to be changed at runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always  use  the UTF-8 fonts.  This also disables the menu
                      entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false,  accord&#8208;
                      ing to the effective value of the utf8 resource.

       utf8Latin1 (class Utf8Latin1)
               If  true,  allow an ISO-8859-1 normal font to be combined with an
               ISO-10646 font if the latter is given via the -fw option  or  its
               corresponding resource value.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       utf8SelectTypes (class Utf8SelectTypes)
               Override xterm&apos;s default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE)
               for selections in wide-character (UTF-8) mode.  The default is an
               empty string, i.e., &#8220;&#8221;, which does not override anything.

       utf8Title (class Utf8Title)
               Applications can set xterm&apos;s title by writing a control sequence.
               Normally this control  sequence  follows  the  VT220  convention,
               which  encodes  the  string in ISO-8859-1 and allows for an 8-bit
               string terminator.  If xterm is started in  a  UTF-8  locale,  it
               translates  the  ISO-8859-1  string  to  UTF-8 to work with the X
               libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.

               However, some users may wish to write a title string  encoded  in
               UTF-8.   The  window  manager  is  responsible for drawing window
               titles.  Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of
               window  titles.   Set  this  resource  to  &#8220;true&#8221;  to allow UTF-8
               encoded title strings.  That cancels the  translation  to  UTF-8,
               allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.

               This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to
               the particular applications you are running  within  xterm.   You
               can  also  use  a  control sequence (see the discussion of &#8220;Title
               Modes&#8221; in the control sequences document), to set  an  equivalent
               flag.   The  titleModes resource sets the same value, which over&#8208;
               rides this resource.

               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       veryBoldColors (class VeryBoldColors)
               Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors  speci&#8208;
               fied  by  colorBD,  colorBL,  colorRV  and colorUL.  The resource
               value is the sum of values for each attribute:
                 1 for reverse,
                 2 for underline,
                 4 for bold and
                 8 for blink.

               The default is &#8220;0&#8221;.
&#12;       visualBell (class VisualBell)
               Specifies whether or not a visible bell (i.e.,  flashing)  should
               be  used  instead  of an audible bell when Control-G is received.
               The default is &#8220;false&#8221;, which tells xterm to use an audible bell.

       visualBellDelay (class VisualBellDelay)
               Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying  a  visual  bell.
               Default  is  100.   If  set to zero, no visual bell is displayed.
               This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on  a
               laptop.

       visualBellLine (class VisualBellLine)
               Specifies  whether to flash only the current line when displaying
               a visual bell.  rather  than  flashing  the  entire  screen:  The
               default is &#8220;false&#8221;, which tells xterm to flash the entire screen.

       vt100Graphics (class VT100Graphics)
               This specifies whether xterm will interpret VT100 graphic charac&#8208;
               ter escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode.  The default is &#8220;true&#8221;,
               to provide support for various legacy applications.

       wideBoldFont (class WideBoldFont)
               This  option  specifies  the  font to be used for displaying bold
               wide text.  By default, it will attempt to use a  font  twice  as
               wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no dou&#8208;
               ble-width font is found, it will  improvise,  by  stretching  the
               bold font.

       wideChars (class WideChars)
               Specifies  if  xterm  should  respond  to  control sequences that
               process 16-bit characters.  The default is &#8220;false&#8221;.

       wideFont (class WideFont)
               This option specifies the font to be  used  for  displaying  wide
               text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as
               the font that will be used to draw normal text.   If  no  double-
               width  font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal
               font.

       ximFont (class XimFont)
               This option specifies the font to  be  used  for  displaying  the
               preedit string in the &#8220;OverTheSpot&#8221; input method.

               In &#8220;OverTheSpot&#8221; preedit type, the preedit (preconversion) string
               is displayed at the position  of  the  cursor.   It  is  the  XIM
               server&apos;s  responsibility  to display the preedit string.  The XIM
               client must inform the XIM server of the  cursor  position.   For
               best  results, the preedit string must be displayed with a proper
               font.  Therefore, xterm informs the  XIM  server  of  the  proper
               font.   The  font  is  be  supplied by a &quot;fontset&quot;, whose default
               value is &#8220;*&#8221;.  This matches every font, the X  library  automati&#8208;
               cally  chooses  fonts with proper charsets.  The ximFont resource
               is provided to override this default font setting.

   Tek4014 Widget Resources
       The following resources are specified  as  part  of  the  tek4014  widget
       (class   Tek4014).    These   are   specified   by   patterns   such   as
       &#8220;XTerm.tek4014.NAME&#8221;:

       font2 (class Font)
               Specifies font number 2 to use in the Tektronix window.

       font3 (class Font)
               Specifies font number 3 to use in the Tektronix window.

       fontLarge (class Font)
               Specifies the large font to use in the Tektronix window.

       fontSmall (class Font)
               Specifies the small font to use in the Tektronix window.

       ginTerminator (class GinTerminator)
               Specifies what character(s) should follow a GIN report or  status
               report.  The possibilities are &#8220;none&#8221;, which sends no terminating
               characters, &#8220;CRonly&#8221;, which sends CR, and &#8220;CR&amp;EOT&#8221;,  which  sends
               both CR and EOT.  The default is &#8220;none&#8221;.
&#12;       height (class Height)
               Specifies the height of the Tektronix window in pixels.

       initialFont (class InitialFont)
               Specifies  which  of  the  four Tektronix fonts to use initially.
               Values are the same as for the set-tek-text action.  The  default
               is &#8220;large&#8221;.

       width (class Width)
               Specifies the width of the Tektronix window in pixels.

   Menu Resources
       The  resources  that may be specified for the various menus are described
       in the documentation for the Athena  SimpleMenu  widget.   The  name  and
       classes  of the entries in each of the menus are listed below.  Resources
       named &#8220;lineN&#8221; where N is a number are separators with class SmeLine.

       The mainMenu has the following entries:

       toolbar (class SmeBSB)
               This entry invokes the set-toolbar(toggle) action.

       securekbd (class SmeBSB)
               This entry invokes the secure() action.

       allowsends (class SmeBSB)
               This entry invokes the allow-send-events(toggle) action.

       redraw (class SmeBSB)
               This entry invokes the redraw() action.

       logging (class SmeBSB)
               This entry invokes the logging(toggle) action.

   Scrollbar Resources
       The  following resources are useful when specified for the Athena Scroll&#8208;
       bar widget:

       thickness (class Thickness)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar.

       background (class Background)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.

       foreground (class Foreground)
               Specifies the color to use for the foreground of  the  scrollbar.
               The  &#8220;thumb&#8221;  of  the  scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern
               alternating pixels for foreground and background color.

POINTER USAGE
       Once the VT102 window is created, xterm allows you  to  select  text  and
       copy it within the same or other windows.

   SELECTION
       The  selection  functions  are  invoked when the pointer buttons are used
       with no modifiers, and when they are used  with  the  &#8220;shift&#8221;  key.   The
       assignment  of  the  functions described below to keys and buttons may be
       changed through the resource database; see ACTIONS below.

       Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut  buf&#8208;
       fer.   Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the button
       down while moving the cursor to the end of the region and  releasing  the
       button.   The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut
       buffer and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is released.   Nor&#8208;
       mally (but see the discussion of on2Clicks, etc):

              -  Double-clicking selects by words.

              -  Triple-clicking selects by lines.

              -  Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.

       Multiple-click  is  determined by the time from button up to button down,
       so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection.  Logi&#8208;
       cal  words  and  lines  selected  by  double- or triple-clicking may wrap
       across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped  by  xterm  itself
       rather  than by the application running in the window.  If the key/button
       bindings specify that an X selection is to be made, xterm will leave  the
       selected text highlighted for as long as it is the selection owner.

       Pointer  button  two  (usually middle) &#8220;types&#8221; (pastes) the text from the
       PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting it as
       keyboard input.

       Pointer  button  three  (usually  right)  extends  the current selection.
       (Without loss of generality, you can swap &#8220;right&#8221; and  &#8220;left&#8221;  everywhere
       in  the  rest  of  this paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to the right
       edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the right  edge
       of  the  selection.   If you contract the selection past the left edge of
       the selection, xterm assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the
       original  selection,  then  extends/contracts the left edge of the selec&#8208;
       tion.  Extension starts in the selection unit mode that the  last  selec&#8208;
       tion  or  extension  was  performed  in;  you can multiple-click to cycle
       through them.

       By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you can
       take  text from several places in different windows and form a command to
       the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it  into
       your  favorite  editor.  Since cut buffers are globally shared among dif&#8208;
       ferent applications, you may regard each as a &#8220;file&#8221; whose  contents  you
       know.   The  terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating
       it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.

   SCROLLING
       The scroll region displays the position  and  amount  of  text  currently
       showing  in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actu&#8208;
       ally saved.  As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size  of  the
       highlighted area decreases.

       Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the adja&#8208;
       cent line to the top of the display window.

       Clicking button three moves the top line of the display  window  down  to
       the pointer position.

       Clicking  button  two  moves  the display to a position in the saved text
       that corresponds to the pointer&apos;s position in the scrollbar.

   TEKTRONIX POINTER
       Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the  copying
       of  text.   It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode the cursor
       will change from an arrow to a cross.  Pressing any key  will  send  that
       key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing button one,
       two, or three will return the letters &#8220;l&#8221;, &#8220;m&#8221;,  and  &#8220;r&#8221;,  respectively.
       If  the &#8220;shift&#8221; key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the cor&#8208;
       responding upper case letter is sent.  To distinguish  a  pointer  button
       from a key, the high bit of the character is set (but this is bit is nor&#8208;
       mally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see tty(4) for details).

SELECT/PASTE
       X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests con&#8208;
       veyed by the server.

   PRIMARY
       When  configured  to  use  the primary selection, (the default) xterm can
       provide the selection data in ways which help to retain character  encod&#8208;
       ing information as it is pasted.

       A  user  &#8220;selects&#8221;  text on xterm, which highlights the selected text.  A
       subsequent &#8220;paste&#8221; to another client forwards a  request  to  the  client
       owning  the selection.  If xterm owns the primary selection, it makes the
       data available in the form of one or more  &#8220;selection  targets&#8221;.   If  it
       does  not  own  the  primary  selection,  e.g.,  if it has released it or
       another client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers  to  pass
       the data.  But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data (officially - some
       clients ignore the rules).

   CLIPBOARD
       When configured to use the clipboard  (see  resource  selectToClipboard),
       the  problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed.  Otherwise, there
       is no difference regarding the data which can be passed via selection.

   SELECTION TARGETS
       The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving
       client asks for.  These are termed selection targets.

       When  asking  for  the selection data, xterm tries the following types in
       this order:

              UTF8_STRING
                   This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data  is
                   encoded  in  UTF-8.   When xterm is built with wide-character
                   support, it both accepts and provides this type.

              TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current
                   locale.

              COMPOUND_TEXT
                   this  is  a  format  for multiple character set data, such as
                   multi-lingual text.  It can store UTF-8  data  as  a  special
                   case.

              STRING
                   This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.

       The  middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if xterm is configured
       with the i18nSelections resource set to &#8220;true&#8221;.

       UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list) since xterm stores
       text as Unicode data when running in wide-character mode, and no transla&#8208;
       tion is needed.  On the other hand, TEXT and  COMPOUND_TEXT  may  require
       translation.   If  the  translation  is  incomplete, they will insert X&apos;s
       &#8220;defaultString&#8221; whose value cannot be  set,  and  may  simply  be  empty.
       Xterm&apos;s defaultString resource specifies the string to use for incomplete
       translations of the UTF8_STRING.

       You can alter the types which xterm tries using  the  eightBitSelectTypes
       or utf8SelectTypes resources.  For instance, you might have some specific
       locale setting which does not use UTF-8 encoding.  The resource value  is
       a  comma-separated  list  of  the selection targets, which consist of the
       names shown.  You can use the special name I18N to  denote  the  optional
       inclusion  of  TEXT  and  COMPOUND_TEXT.   The names are matched ignoring
       case, and can be abbreviated.  The default list can be expressed in  sev&#8208;
       eral ways, e.g.,

              UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
              utf8,i18n,string
              u,i,s

MENUS
       Xterm  has  four  menus,  named  mainMenu, vtMenu, fontMenu, and tekMenu.
       Each menu pops up under  the  correct  combinations  of  key  and  button
       presses.   Each  menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal
       line.  Some menu entries correspond to modes  that  can  be  altered.   A
       check  mark  appears  next to a mode that is currently active.  Selecting
       one of these modes toggles its state.  Other menu entries  are  commands;
       selecting one of these performs the indicated function.

       All  of the menu entries correspond to X actions.  In the list below, the
       menu label is shown followed by the action&apos;s name in parenthesis.

   Main Options
       The xterm mainMenu pops up when the &#8220;control&#8221; key and pointer button  one
       are pressed in a window.  This menu contains items that apply to both the
       VT102 and Tektronix windows.  There are several sections:

       Commands for managing X events:

              Toolbar
                     Clicking on the &#8220;Toolbar&#8221; menu entry hides the  toolbar  if
                     it is visible, and shows it if it is not.

              Secure Keyboard (securekbd)
                     The  Secure  Keyboard  mode is helpful when typing in pass&#8208;
                     words or other sensitive data in an  unsecure  environment;
                     see SECURITY below (but read the limitations carefully).

              Allow SendEvents (allowsends)
                     Specifies  whether  or  not synthetic key and button events
                     generated using the X protocol SendEvent request should  be
                     interpreted   or   discarded.    This  corresponds  to  the
                     allowSendEvents resource.

              Redraw Window (redraw)
                     Forces the X display to repaint; useful  in  some  environ&#8208;
                     ments.

       Commands for capturing output:

              Log to File (logging)
                     Captures text sent to the screen in a logfile, as in the -l
                     logging option.

              Print-All Immediately
                     Invokes the print-immediate action, sending the text of the
                     current  window  directly  to  a  file, as specified by the
                     printFileImmediate, printModeImmediate and printOptsImmedi&#8208;
                     ate resources.

              Print-All on Error
                     Invokes  the  print-on-error  action,  which toggles a flag
                     telling xterm that if it exits with an X error, to send the
                     text of the current window directly to a file, as specified
                     by the printFileXError, printModeXError and printOptsXError
                     resources.

              Print Window (print)
                     Sends  the  text of the current window to the program given
                     in the printerCommand resource.

              Redirect to Printer (print-redir)
                     This sets the printerControlMode to 0 or 2.   You  can  use
                     this  to  turn the printer on as if an application had sent
                     the appropriate control sequence.  It is  also  useful  for
                     switching  the  printer  off  if an application turns it on
                     without resetting the print control mode.

       Modes for setting keyboard style:

              8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control)
                     Enabled for VT220 emulation, this  controls  whether  xterm
                     will  send  8-bit control sequences rather than using 7-bit
                     (ASCII) controls, e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159
                     rather than the escape character followed by a second byte.
                     Xterm  always  interprets  both  8-bit  and  7-bit  control
                     sequences (see the document Xterm Control Sequences).  This
                     corresponds to the eightBitControl resource.

              Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow key)
                     Modifies the behavior  of  the  backarrow  key,  making  it
                     transmit  either a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.
                     This corresponds to the backarrowKey resource.

              Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
                     Controls the treatment of Alt- and  NumLock-key  modifiers.
                     This corresponds to the numLock resource.

              Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc)
                     Controls whether Meta keys are converted into a two-charac&#8208;
                     ter sequence with the character  itself  preceded  by  ESC.
                     This corresponds to the metaSendsEscape resource.

              Delete is DEL (delete-is-del)
                     Controls  whether  the  Delete  key  on  the editing keypad
                     should send DEL (127)  or  the  VT220-style  Remove  escape
                     sequence.  This corresponds to the deleteIsDEL resource.

              Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys)

              HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys)

              SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys)

              Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)

              VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard)
                     These  act  as  a radio-button, selecting one style for the
                     keyboard layout.  It corresponds to more than one  resource
                     setting:  sunKeyboard, sunFunctionKeys, scoFunctionKeys and
                     hpFunctionKeys .&quot;

       Commands for process signalling:

              Send STOP Signal (suspend)

              Send CONT Signal (continue)

              Send INT Signal (interrupt)

              Send HUP Signal (hangup)

              Send TERM Signal (terminate)

              Send KILL Signal (kill)
                     These send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT,  SIGINT,  SIGHUP,  SIGTERM
                     and  SIGKILL  signals respectively, to the process group of
                     the process running under xterm (usually the  shell).   The
                     SIGCONT function is especially useful if the user has acci&#8208;
                     dentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending the process.

              Quit (quit)
                     Stop processing  X  events  except  to  support  the  -hold
                     option,  and  then  send a SIGHUP signal to the the process
                     group of the  process  running  under  xterm  (usually  the
                     shell).

   VT Options
       The  vtMenu  sets  various modes in the VT102 emulation, and is popped up
       when the &#8220;control&#8221; key and pointer button two are pressed  in  the  VT102
       window.

       VT102/VT220 Modes:

              Enable Scrollbar (scrollbar)
                     Enable (or disable) the scrollbar.  This corresponds to the
                     -sb option and the scrollBar resource.

              Enable Jump Scroll (jumpscroll)
                     Enable (or disable) jump scrolling.   This  corresponds  to
                     the -j option and the jumpScroll resource.

              Enable Reverse Video (reversevideo)
                     Enable (or disable) reverse-video.  This corresponds to the
                     -rv option and the reverseVideo resource.

              Enable Auto Wraparound (autowrap)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-wraparound.  This  corresponds  to
                     the -aw option and the autoWrap resource.

              Enable Reverse Wraparound (reversewrap)
                     Enable  (or  disable) reverse wraparound.  This corresponds
                     to the -rw option and the reverseWrap resource.

              Enable Auto Linefeed (autolinefeed)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-linefeed.  This is the  VT102  NEL
                     function,  which  causes  the  emulator  to emit a linefeed
                     after each carriage return.  There is no corresponding com&#8208;
                     mand-line option or resource setting.

              Enable Application Cursor Keys (appcursor)
                     Enable  (or  disable) application cursor keys.  This corre&#8208;
                     sponds to the appcursorDefault resource.  There is no  cor&#8208;
                     responding command-line option.

              Enable Application Keypad (appkeypad)
                     Enable  (or  disable) application keypad keys.  This corre&#8208;
                     sponds to the appkeypadDefault resource.  There is no  cor&#8208;
                     responding command-line option.

              Scroll to Bottom on Key Press (scrollkey)
                     Enable   (or  disable)  scrolling  to  the  bottom  of  the
                     scrolling region on a keypress.  This  corresponds  to  the
                     -sk option and the scrollKey resource.

                     As  a special case, the XON / XOFF keys (control/S and con&#8208;
                     trol/Q) are ignored.

              Scroll to Bottom on Tty Output (scrollttyoutput)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  scrolling  to  the  bottom  of   the
                     scrolling  region  on  output to the terminal.  This corre&#8208;
                     sponds to the -si option and the scrollTtyOutput resource.

              Allow 80/132 Column Switching (allow132)
                     Enable (or disable) switching between 80 and  132  columns.
                     This corresponds to the -132 option and the c132 resource.

              Keep Selection (keepSelection)
                     Tell  xterm  whether  to disown the selection when it stops
                     highlighting it, e.g., when  an  application  modifies  the
                     display  so  that  it  no longer matches the text which has
                     been highlighted.  As long as xterm continues  to  own  the
                     selection,  it  can provide the corresponding text to other
                     clients via cut/paste.  This corresponds to the  keepSelec&#8208;
                     tion  resource.   There  is  no  corresponding command-line
                     option.

              Select to Clipboard (selectToClipboard)
                     Tell xterm whether to use  the  PRIMARY  or  CLIPBOARD  for
                     SELECT  tokens in the translations resource which maps key&#8208;
                     board and mouse actions to select/paste actions.  This cor&#8208;
                     responds  to  the  selectToClipboard resource.  There is no
                     corresponding command-line option.

              Enable Visual Bell (visualbell)
                     Enable (or disable) visible bell (i.e.,  flashing)  instead
                     of an audible bell.  This corresponds to the -vb option and
                     the visualBell resource.

              Enable Bell Urgency (bellIsUrgent)
                     Enable (or disable) Urgency window manager hint  when  Con&#8208;
                     trol-G  is  received.  This corresponds to the bellIsUrgent
                     resource.

              Enable Pop on Bell (poponbell)
                     Enable (or disable) raising of the window when Control-G is
                     received.   This  corresponds  to  the  -pop option and the
                     popOnBell resource.

              Enable Blinking Cursor (cursorblink)
                     Enable (or disable) the blinking-cursor feature.  This cor&#8208;
                     responds  to  the  -bc option and the cursorBlink resource.
                     There is also an escape sequence (see  the  document  Xterm
                     Control Sequences).  The menu entry and the escape sequence
                     states are XOR&apos;d: if both are enabled, the cursor will  not
                     blink, if only one is enabled, the cursor will blink.

              Enable Alternate Screen Switching (titeInhibit)
                     Enable (or disable) switching between the normal and alter&#8208;
                     nate  screens.   This  corresponds   to   the   titeInhibit
                     resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              Enable Active Icon (activeicon)
                     Enable  (or  disable) the active-icon feature.  This corre&#8208;
                     sponds to the -ai option and the activeIcon resource.

       VT102/VT220 Commands:

              Do Soft Reset (softreset)
                     Reset scroll regions.  This can  be  convenient  when  some
                     program  has left the scroll regions set incorrectly (often
                     a problem when using VMS or TOPS-20).  This corresponds  to
                     the VT220 DECSTR control sequence.

              Do Full Reset (hardreset)
                     The  full  reset entry will clear the screen, reset tabs to
                     every eight columns, and reset the terminal modes (such  as
                     wrap  and smooth scroll) to their initial states just after
                     xterm has finished processing  the  command  line  options.
                     This  corresponds to the VT102 RIS control sequence, with a
                     few obvious differences.  For example, your session is  not
                     disconnected as a real VT102 would do.

              Reset and Clear Saved Lines (clearsavedlines)
                     Perform a full reset, and also clear the saved lines.

       Commands for setting the current screen:

              Show Tek Window (tekshow)
                     When  enabled,  pops the Tektronix 4014 window up (makes it
                     visible).  When disabled, hides the Tektronix 4014 window.

              Switch to Tek Mode (tekmode)
                     When enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up  if  it  is
                     not  already visible, and switches the input stream to that
                     window.  When disabled, hides the Tektronix 4014 window and
                     switches input back to the VTxxx window.

              Hide VT Window (vthide)
                     When  enabled,  hides the VTxxx window, shows the Tektronix
                     4014 window if it was not already visible and switches  the
                     input  stream  to  that  window.   When disabled, shows the
                     VTxxx window, and switches the input stream to that window.

              Show Alternate Screen (altscreen)
                     When enabled, shows the alternate screen.   When  disabled,
                     shows  the  normal screen.  Note that the normal screen may
                     have saved lines; the alternate screen does not.

   VT Fonts
       The fontMenu pops up when when the &#8220;control&#8221; key and pointer button three
       are  pressed  in a window.  It sets the font used in the VT102 window, or
       modifies the way the font is specified or displayed.  There  are  several
       sections.

       The  first  section  allows you to select the font from a set of alterna&#8208;
       tives:

              Default (fontdefault)
                     Set the font to  the  default,  i.e.,  that  given  by  the
                     *VT100.font resource.

              Unreadable (font1)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font1 resource.

              Tiny (font2)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font2 resource.

              Small (font3)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font3 resource.

              Medium (font4)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font4 resource.

              Large (font5)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font5 resource.

              Huge (font6)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font6 resource.

              Escape Sequence
                     This  allows  you to set the font last specified by the Set
                     Font  escape  sequence  (see  the  document  Xterm  Control
                     Sequences).

              Selection (fontsel)
                     This  allows  you  to  set  the  font specified the current
                     selection as a font  name  (if  the  PRIMARY  selection  is
                     owned).

       The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:

              Bold Fonts
                     This  is normally checked (enabled).  When unchecked, xterm
                     will not use bold fonts.  The setting  corresponds  to  the
                     allowBoldFonts resource.

              Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing)
                     When  set, tells xterm to draw its own line-drawing charac&#8208;
                     ters.  Otherwise it relies on the  font  containing  these.
                     Compare to the forceBoxChars resource.

              Packed Font (font-packed)
                     When set, tells xterm to use the minimum glyph-width from a
                     font when displaying characters.   Use  the  maximum  width
                     (unchecked) to help display proportional fonts.  Compare to
                     the forcePackedFont resource.

              Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize)
                     When set, xterm may ask the font server to  produce  scaled
                     versions  of the normal font, for VT102 double-size charac&#8208;
                     ters.

       The third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:

              TrueType Fonts (render-font)
                     If the renderFont and  corresponding  resources  were  set,
                     this  is  a further control whether xterm will actually use
                     the Xft library calls to obtain a font.

              UTF-8 Encoding (utf8-mode)
                     This  controls  whether  xterm  uses  UTF-8   encoding   of
                     input/output.  It is useful for temporarily switching xterm
                     to display text from an application which does  not  follow
                     the locale settings.  It corresponds to the utf8 resource.

              UTF-8 Fonts (utf8-fonts)
                     This  controls  whether xterm uses UTF-8 fonts for display.
                     It is useful for temporarily  switching  xterm  to  display
                     text  from  an application which does not follow the locale
                     settings.  It combines the utf8 and utf8Fonts resources.

              UTF-8 Titles (utf8-titles)
                     This controls whether  xterm  accepts  UTF-8  encoding  for
                     title  control  sequences.  It corresponds to the utf8Fonts
                     resource.

                     Initially the checkmark is set according to both  the  utf8
                     and  utf8Fonts  resource  values.   If the latter is set to
                     &#8220;always&#8221;, the checkmark is disabled.   Likewise,  if  there
                     are  no fonts given in the utf8Fonts subresources, then the
                     checkmark also is disabled.

                     The standard XTerm app-defaults file defines both  sets  of
                     fonts,  while the UXTerm app-defaults file defines only one
                     set.  assuming the standard app-defaults files,  this  com&#8208;
                     mand  will  launch  xterm  able to switch between UTF-8 and
                     ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:

                         uxterm -class XTerm

       The fourth section allows you to enable  or  disable  special  operations
       which  can  be  controlled  by  writing escape sequences to the terminal.
       These are disabled if the SendEvents feature is enabled:

              Allow Color Ops (allow-font-ops)
                     This corresponds to the allowColorOps resource.  Enable  or
                     disable control sequences that set/query the colors.

              Allow Font Ops (allow-font-ops)
                     This  corresponds  to the allowFontOps resource.  Enable or
                     disable control sequences that set/query the font.

              Allow Tcap Ops (allow-tcap-ops)
                     Enable or disable control sequences that query  the  termi&#8208;
                     nal&apos;s  notion  of  its  function-key strings, as termcap or
                     terminfo capabilities.  This  corresponds  to  the  allowT&#8208;
                     capOps resource.

              Allow Title Ops (allow-title-ops)
                     Enable  or disable control sequences that modify the window
                     title or icon name.  This corresponds to the  allowTitleOps
                     resource.

              Allow Window Ops (allow-window-ops)
                     Enable  or  disable  extended  window control sequences (as
                     used in dtterm).  This corresponds  to  the  allowWindowOps
                     resource.

   TEK Options
       The  tekMenu sets various modes in the Tektronix emulation, and is popped
       up when the &#8220;control&#8221; key and pointer button two are pressed in the  Tek&#8208;
       tronix  window.  The current font size is checked in the modes section of
       the menu.

              Large Characters (tektextlarge)

              #2 Size Characters (tektext2)

              #3 Size Characters (tektext3)

              Small Characters (tektextsmall)

       Commands:

              PAGE (tekpage)
                     Clear the Tektronix window.

              RESET (tekreset)

              COPY (tekcopy)

       Windows:

              Show VT Window (vtshow)

              Switch to VT Mode (vtmode)

              Hide Tek Window (tekhide)

SECURITY
       X environments differ in their security consciousness.

       &#183;   Most servers, run under xdm, are capable of using  a  &#8220;magic  cookie&#8221;
           authorization  scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security
           for many people.  If your server is only using a host-based mechanism
           to  control  access  to the server (see xhost(1)), then if you enable
           access for a host and other users are also permitted to  run  clients
           on that same host, it is possible that someone can run an application
           which uses the basic services of the X  protocol  to  snoop  on  your
           activities, potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type
           at the keyboard.

       &#183;   Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate  it  in
           ways that you might not anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard to
           itself and sending events to your  application&apos;s  windows.   This  is
           true  even  with  the &#8220;magic cookie&#8221; authorization scheme.  While the
           allowSendEvents provides some protection against  rogue  applications
           tampering with your programs, guarding against a snooper is harder.

       &#183;   The  X  input  extension for instance allows an application to bypass
           all of the  other  (limited)  authorization  and  security  features,
           including the GrabKeyboard protocol.

       &#183;   The  possibility  of  an  application spying on your keystrokes is of
           particular concern when you want to type in a password or other  sen&#8208;
           sitive  data.   The  best solution to this problem is to use a better
           authorization mechanism than is provided by X.

       Subject to all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for protecting
       keyboard input in xterm.

       The  xterm menu (see MENUS above) contains a Secure Keyboard entry which,
       when enabled, attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is directed only
       to  xterm (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).  When an application
       prompts you for a password (or other  sensitive  data),  you  can  enable
       Secure Keyboard using the menu, type in the data, and then disable Secure
       Keyboard using the menu again.

       &#183;   This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.

       &#183;   It cannot ensure that there are no processes  which  have  access  to
           your X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well.

       Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt to
       enable Secure Keyboard it may fail.  In this case, the bell  will  sound.
       If  the  Secure  Keyboard  succeeds, the foreground and background colors
       will be exchanged (as if you selected the  Reverse  Video  entry  in  the
       Modes  menu); they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode.  If
       the colors do not switch, then you should be very suspicious that you are
       being  spoofed.   If  the  application  you are running displays a prompt
       before asking for the password, it is safest to enter secure mode  before
       the  prompt  gets  displayed,  and to make sure that the prompt gets dis&#8208;
       played correctly (in the new colors),  to  minimize  the  probability  of
       spoofing.   You  can  also  bring  up the menu again and make sure that a
       check mark appears next to the entry.

       Secure Keyboard mode will be disabled automatically if your xterm  window
       becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up a reparent&#8208;
       ing window manager (that places a title bar or  other  decoration  around
       the  window)  while in Secure Keyboard mode.  (This is a feature of the X
       protocol not easily overcome.)  When this  happens,  the  foreground  and
       background  colors will be switched back and the bell will sound in warn&#8208;
       ing.

CHARACTER CLASSES
       Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession (double-click&#8208;
       ing) causes all characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white space,
       punctuation) to be selected as a &#8220;word&#8221;.   Since  different  people  have
       different  preferences  for  what should be selected (for example, should
       filenames be selected as a whole or  only  the  separate  subnames),  the
       default mapping can be overridden through the use of the charClass (class
       CharClass) resource.

       This resource is a series of comma-separated of range:value  pairs.   The
       range  is  either a single number or low-high in the range of 0 to 65535,
       corresponding to the code for the character or characters to be set.  The
       value  is arbitrary, although the default table uses the character number
       of the first character occurring in the set.  When  not  in  UTF-8  mode,
       only the first 256 bytes of this table will be used.

       The default table starts as follows -

           static int charClass[256] = {

       For  example,  the string &#8220;33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48&#8221; indicates that the
       exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash, and ampersand  char&#8208;
       acters should be treated the same way as characters and numbers.  This is
       useful for cutting and pasting electronic  mailing  addresses  and  file&#8208;
       names.

ACTIONS
       It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings
       for input, by changing  the  translations  resources  for  the  vt100  or
       tek4014  widgets.   Changing  the  translations resource for events other
       than key and button events is not expected, and will cause  unpredictable
       behavior.  The following actions are provided for use within the vt100 or
       tek4014 translations resources:

       allow-color-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This action set or toggles the allowColorOps resource and is also
               invoked by the allow-color-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-font-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This  action set or toggles the allowFontOps resource and is also
               invoked by the allow-font-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-send-events(on/off/toggle)
               This action set or toggles the allowSendEvents  resource  and  is
               also invoked by the allowsends entry in mainMenu.

       allow-tcap-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This  action set or toggles the allowTcapOps resource and is also
               invoked by the allow-tcap-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-title-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This action set or toggles the allowTitleOps resource and is also
               invoked by the allow-title-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-window-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This  action  set  or  toggles the allowWindowOps resource and is
               also invoked by the allow-window-ops entry in fontMenu.
&#12;       alt-sends-escape()
               This action toggles the state of the altSendsEscape resource.

       bell([percent])
               This action rings the keyboard bell at the  specified  percentage
               above or below the base volume.

       clear-saved-lines()
               This  action  does  hard-reset()  (see below) and also clears the
               history of lines saved off the top of the  screen.   It  is  also
               invoked  from the clearsavedlines entry in vtMenu.  The effect is
               identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.

       copy-selection(destname [, ...])
               This action puts the currently selected  text  into  all  of  the
               selections  or  cutbuffers specified by destname.  Unlike select-
               end, it does not send a mouse position or  otherwise  modify  the
               internal selection state.

       create-menu(m/v/f/t)
               This action creates one of the menus used by xterm, if it has not
               been previously created.   The  parameter  values  are  the  menu
               names: mainMenu, vtMenu, fontMenu, tekMenu, respectively.

       dabbrev-expand()
               Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text
               on the screen and in the scrollback  buffer  for  words  starting
               with that abbreviation.  Repeating dabbrev-expand() several times
               in sequence searches for an alternative expansion by looking far&#8208;
               ther  back.   Lack  of  more  matches  is  signaled  by a beep().
               Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor  is  preceded
               by  a  space) yield successively all previous words.  Consecutive
               identical expansions are ignored.  The word here is defined as  a
               sequence  of  non-whitespace  characters.  This feature partially
               emulates the behavior  of  &#8220;dynamic  abbreviation&#8221;  expansion  in
               Emacs (bound there to M-/).  Here is a resource setting for xterm
               which will do the same thing:

                   *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
                        Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt; /:dabbrev-expand()


       deiconify()
               Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.

       delete-is-del()
               This action toggles the state of the deleteIsDEL resource.

       dired-button()
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by  echoing
               the  event&apos;s  position  (i.e.,  character line and column) in the
               following format:

                       ^X ESC G &lt;line+&#8220; &#8221;&gt; &lt;col+&#8220; &#8221;&gt;

       fullscreen()
               Asks the window manager to change the window to full-screen.

       iconify()
               Iconifies the window.

       hard-reset()
               This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window  size,  and
               cursor  keys  and clears the screen.  It is also invoked from the
               hardreset entry in vtMenu.

       ignore()
               This action ignores the event  but  checks  for  special  pointer
               position escape sequences.

       insert()
               This  action  inserts the character or string associated with the
               key that was pressed.

       insert-eight-bit()
               This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the  character
               or string associated with the key that was pressed.  Only single-
               byte values are treated specially.  The exact action  depends  on
               the  value  of the altSendsEscape and the metaSendsEscape and the
               eightBitInput resources.  The metaSendsEscape resource is  tested
               first.  See the eightBitInput resource for a full discussion.

               The term &#8220;eight-bit&#8221; is misleading: xterm checks if the key is in
               the range 128 to 255 (the eighth bit is set).  If the value is in
               that  range,  depending on the resource values, xterm may then do
               one of the following:

               &#183;   add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,

               &#183;   send an ESC byte before the key, or

               &#183;   send the key unaltered.

       exec-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])
               Execute an external command, using the current selection for part
               of  the  command&apos;s parameters.  The first parameter, format gives
               the basic command.  Succeeding parameters specify  the  selection
               source as in insert-selection.

               The format parameter allows these substitutions:

               %%   inserts a &quot;%&quot;.

               %P   the  screen-position  at  the  beginning  of the highlighted
                    region, as a semicolon-separated pair of integers using  the
                    values that the CUP control sequence would use.

               %p   the  screen-position  after the beginning of the highlighted
                    region, using the same convention as &#8220;%P&#8221;.

               %S   the length of the string that &#8220;%s&#8221; would insert.

               %s   the content of the selection, unmodified.

               %T   the length of the string that &#8220;%t&#8221; would insert.

               %t   the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing  whitespace,  and
                    newlines changed to single spaces.

               %V   the  video  attributes  at  the beginning of the highlighted
                    region, as a semicolon-separated list of integers using  the
                    values that the SGR control sequence would use.

               %v   the  video  attributes  after  the  end  of  the highlighted
                    region, using the same convention as &#8220;%V&#8221;.

               After constructing the command-string, xterm forks  a  subprocess
               and executes the command, which completes independently of xterm.

       exec-selectable(format, onClicks)
               Execute  an  external  command, using data copied from the screen
               for part of the command&apos;s parameters.  The first parameter,  for&#8208;
               mat  gives  the  basic  command as in exec-formatted.  The second
               parameter specifies the method for copying the  data  as  in  the
               onClicks resource.

       insert-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])
               Insert  the  current  selection or data related to it, formatted.
               The first parameter, format gives the template for the data as in
               exec-formatted.   Succeeding  parameters  specify  the  selection
               source as in insert-selection.

       insert-selectable(format, onClicks)
               Insert data copied from the screen, formatted.  The first parame&#8208;
               ter, format gives the template for the data as in exec-formatted.
               The second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as
               in the onClicks resource.

       insert-selection(sourcename [, ...])
               This  action  inserts  the  string found in the selection or cut&#8208;
               buffer indicated by sourcename.  Sources are checked in the order
               given  (case  is  significant) until one is found.  Commonly-used
               selections include: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and CLIPBOARD.  Cut  buf&#8208;
               fers are typically named CUT_BUFFER0 through CUT_BUFFER7.

       insert-seven-bit()
               This  action  is  a  synonym for insert() The term &#8220;seven-bit&#8221; is
               misleading: it only implies that xterm does not try to add 128 to
               the key&apos;s value as in insert-eight-bit().

       interpret(control-sequence)
               Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without pass&#8208;
               ing it to the host.  This works by inserting the control sequence
               at the front of the input buffer.  Use &#8220;\&#8221; to escape octal digits
               in the string.  Xt does not allow you to  put  a  null  character
               (i.e., &#8220;\000&#8221;) in the string.

       keymap(name)
               This  action  dynamically  defines  a new translation table whose
               resource name is name with the suffix Keymap  (case  is  signifi&#8208;
               cant).  The name None restores the original translation table.

       larger-vt-font()
               Set  the  font  to  the next larger one, based on the font dimen&#8208;
               sions.  See also set-vt-font().

       load-vt-fonts(name[,class])
               Load fontnames from the given subresource name and  class.   That
               is,  load  the &#8220;*VT100.name.font&#8221;, resource as &#8220;*VT100.font&#8221; etc.
               If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.

               Unlike set-vt-font(),  this  does  not  affect  the  escape-  and
               select-fonts,  since  those are not based on resource values.  It
               does affect the fonts loosely organized under the &#8220;Default&#8221;  menu
               entry, including font, boldFont, wideFont and wideBoldFont.

       maximize()
               Resizes the window to fill the screen.

       meta-sends-escape()

       popup-menu(menuname)
               This action displays the specified popup menu.  Valid names (case
               is significant) include:  mainMenu, vtMenu,  fontMenu,  and  tek&#8208;
               Menu.

       print(printer-flags)
               This  action  prints  the window and is also invoked by the print
               entry in mainMenu.

               The action accepts optional parameters, which  temporarily  over&#8208;
               ride  resource settings.  The parameter values are matched ignor&#8208;
               ing case:

               noFormFeed
                    no form feed will be sent  at  the  end  of  the  last  line
                    printed (i.e., printerFormFeed is ``false&apos;&apos;).

               FormFeed
                    a form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed
                    (i.e., printerFormFeed is ``true&apos;&apos;).

               noNewLine
                    no newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed,
                    and  wrapped  lines  will be combined into long lines (i.e.,
                    printerNewLine is ``false&apos;&apos;).

               NewLine
                    a newline will be sent at the end of the last line  printed,
                    and  each  line will be limited (by adding a newline) to the
                    screen width (i.e., printerNewLine is ``true&apos;&apos;).

               noAttrs
                    the page  is  printed  without  attributes  (i.e.,  printAt&#8208;
                    tributes is ``0&apos;&apos;).

               monoAttrs
                    the  page  is  printed  with  monochrome  (vt220) attributes
                    (i.e., printAttributes is ``1&apos;&apos;).

               colorAttrs
                    the page is printed with ANSI color attributes (i.e., print&#8208;
                    Attributes is ``2&apos;&apos;).

       print-everything(printer-flags)
               This  action  sends  the  entire text history, in addition to the
               text currently visible, to the program given in  the  printerCom&#8208;
               mand  resource.   It  allows  the same optional parameters as the
               print action.  With a suitable printer command, the action can be
               used to load the text history in an editor.

       print-immediate()
               Sends the text of the current window directly to a file, as spec&#8208;
               ified by the printFileImmediate, printModeImmediate and printOpt&#8208;
               sImmediate resources.

       print-on-error()
               Toggles a flag telling xterm that if it exits with an X error, to
               send the text of the current window directly to a file, as speci&#8208;
               fied  by the printFileXError, printModeXError and printOptsXError
               resources.

       print-redir()
               This action toggles the printerControlMode between 0 and 2.   The
               corresponding  popup  menu  entry  is  useful  for  switching the
               printer off if you happen to change your mind after  deciding  to
               print random binary files on the terminal.

       quit()  This  action  sends  a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.  It is
               also invoked by the quit entry in mainMenu.

       readline-button()
               Supports the optional readline feature by echoing repeated cursor
               forward or backward control sequences on button release event, to
               request that the host application update its notion of  the  cur&#8208;
               sor&apos;s position to match the button event.

       redraw()
               This  action redraws the window and is also invoked by the redraw
               entry in mainMenu.

       restore()
               Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.

       scroll-back(count [,units [,mouse] ])
               This action scrolls the text window backward so  that  text  that
               had previously scrolled off the top of the screen is now visible.

               The  count  argument  indicates the number of units (which may be
               page, halfpage, pixel, or line) by which to scroll.

               An adjustment can be specified for these values  by  appending  a
               &#8220;+&#8221;  or  &#8220;-&#8221; sign followed by a number, e.g., page-2 to specify 2
               lines less than a page.

               If the third parameter mouse is given, the action is ignored when
               mouse reporting is enabled.

       scroll-forw(count [,units [,mouse] ])
               This  action  is similar to scroll-back except that it scrolls in

               This action puts the currently selected  text  into  all  of  the
               selections  or cutbuffers specified by destname.  It also sends a
               mouse position  and  updates  the  internal  selection  state  to
               reflect the end of the selection process.

       select-extend()
               This  action  tracks  the  pointer and extends the selection.  It
               should only be bound to Motion events.

       select-set()
               This action stores text that corresponds to  the  current  selec&#8208;
               tion, without affecting the selection mode.

       select-start()
               This  action  begins  text selection at the current pointer loca&#8208;
               tion.  See the section on POINTER USAGE for information on making
               selections.

               invoked by the selectToClipboard entry in vtMenu.

       set-sco-function-keys(on/off/toggle)
               This action toggles the  scoFunctionKeys  resource  and  is  also
               invoked by the scoFunctionKeys entry in mainMenu.

       set-sun-function-keys(on/off/toggle)

               invoked by the sunFunctionKeys entry in mainMenu.

       set-sun-keyboard(on/off/toggle)
               This action toggles the sunKeyboard resource and is also  invoked
               by the sunKeyboard entry in mainMenu.

       set-tek-text(large/2/3/small)
               This  action  sets font used in the Tektronix window to the value
               of the resources tektextlarge, tektext2, tektext3, and  tektexts&#8208;
               mall  according  to  the  argument.   It  is  also invoked by the
               entries of the same names as the resources in tekMenu.

       set-terminal-type(type)
               This action directs output to  either  the  vt  or  tek  windows,
               according  to the type string.  It is also invoked by the tekmode
               entry in vtMenu and the vtmode entry in tekMenu.

       set-titeInhibit(on/off/toggle)
               This action toggles  the  titeInhibit  resource,  which  controls
               switching between the alternate and current screens.

       set-toolbar(on/off/toggle)
               This  action  toggles  the toolbar feature and is also invoked by

               utf8-mode entry in fontMenu.

       set-utf8-title(on/off/toggle)
               This action toggles the utf8Title resource and is also invoked by
               the utf8-title entry in fontMenu.

       set-visibility(vt/tek,on/off/toggle)
               This action controls whether or not the vt  or  tek  windows  are
               visible.   It is also invoked from the tekshow and vthide entries
               in vtMenu and the vtshow and tekhide entries in tekMenu.

       set-visual-bell(on/off/toggle)
               This action toggles the visualBell resource and is  also  invoked
               by the visualbell entry in vtMenu.

       set-vt-font(d/1/2/3/4/5/6/e/s [,normalfont [, boldfont]])
               This  action  sets  the font or fonts currently being used in the
               VT102 window.  The first argument  is  a  single  character  that
               specifies the font to be used:

               d  or  D  indicate the default font (the font initially used when
                      xterm was started),

               1 through 6 indicate the fonts specified  by  the  font1  through
                      font6 resources,

               e  or  E  indicate  the  normal and bold fonts that have been set
                      through escape codes (or specified as the second and third
                      action arguments, respectively), and

               s  or  S indicate the font selection (as made by programs such as
                      xfontsel(1)) indicated by the second action argument.

               If xterm is configured to support wide characters, an  additional
               two  optional  parameters are recognized for the e argument: wide
               font and wide bold font.

       smaller-vt-font()
               Set the font to the next smaller one, based on  the  font  dimen&#8208;
               sions.  See also set-vt-font().

       soft-reset()
               This  action resets the scrolling region and is also invoked from
               the softreset entry in vtMenu.  The effect is identical to a soft
               reset (DECSTR) control sequence.

       spawn-new-terminal(params)
               Spawn  a  new  xterm process.  This is available on systems which
               have a modern version of the process filesystem,  e.g.,  &#8220;/proc&#8221;,
               which xterm can read.

               Use  the &#8220;cwd&#8221; process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/cwd to obtain the
               working directory of the process which is running in the  current
               xterm.

               On   systems   which   have   the   &#8220;exe&#8221;  process  entry,  e.g.,
               /proc/12345/exe, use this to obtain the actual executable.   Oth&#8208;
               erwise, use the $PATH variable to find xterm.

               If parameters are given in the action, pass them to the new xterm
               process.

       start-extend()
               This action is similar to select-start except that the  selection
               is extended to the current pointer location.

       start-cursor-extend()
               This action is similar to select-extend except that the selection
               is extended to the current text cursor position.

       string(string)
               This action inserts the specified text string as if it  had  been
               typed.   Quotation is necessary if the string contains whitespace
               or non-alphanumeric characters.  If the  string  argument  begins
               with  the  characters  &#8220;0x&#8221;, it is interpreted as a hex character
               constant.

       tek-copy()
               This action copies the escape codes used to generate the  current
               window contents to a file in the current directory beginning with
               the name COPY.  It is also invoked from the tekcopy entry in tek&#8208;
               Menu.

       tek-page()
               This  action  clears  the Tektronix window and is also invoked by
               the tekpage entry in tekMenu.

       tek-reset()
               This action resets the Tektronix window and is  also  invoked  by
               the tekreset entry in tekMenu.

       vi-button()
               Handles  a button event (other than press and release) by echoing
               a control sequence computed from the event&apos;s line number  in  the
               screen relative to the current line:

                       ESC ^P
               or
                       ESC ^N

               according  to  whether  the event is before, or after the current
               line, respectively.  The ^N (or ^P) is  repeated  once  for  each
               line  that  the event differs from the current line.  The control
               sequence is omitted altogether if the button event is on the cur&#8208;
               rent line.

       visual-bell()
               This action flashes the window quickly.

       The Tektronix window also has the following action:

       gin-press(l/L/m/M/r/R)
               This action sends the indicated graphics input code.
&#12;       The  default  bindings in the VT102 window use the SELECT token, which is
       set by the selectToClipboard resource:

                     Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Prior:scroll-back(1,halfpage) \n\
                      Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Next:scroll-forw(1,halfpage) \n\
                    Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Select:select-cursor-start() \

                                  &lt;BtnDown&gt;:ignore()

       The default bindings for the scrollbar widget are separate from the VT100
       widget:

                                 &lt;Btn5Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                                 &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                                 &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                                 &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                                 &lt;Btn4Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                                 &lt;Btn2Motion&gt;: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                                 &lt;BtnUp&gt;:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

       The default bindings in the Tektronix window are:

                            ~Meta&lt;KeyPress&gt;: insert-seven-bit() \n\
                             Meta&lt;KeyPress&gt;: insert-eight-bit() \n\
                           !Ctrl &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                           !Ctrl &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: gin-press(L) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: gin-press(l) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: gin-press(M) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: gin-press(m) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: gin-press(R) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: gin-press(r)

       Here  is  an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clip&#8208;
       board, and unshifted select/paste for the  primary  selection.   In  each
       case,  a  (different)  cut  buffer  is  also  a  target  or source of the
       select/paste operation.  It is important to remember  however,  that  cut
       buffers  store  data  in  ISO-8859-1 encoding, while selections can store
       data in a variety of formats and encodings.  While xterm owns the  selec&#8208;
       tion, it highlights it.  When it loses the selection, it removes the cor&#8208;
       responding highlight.  But you can still paste from the corresponding cut
       buffer.

           *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
               ~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
               Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) \n\
               ~Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:       select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
               Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:        select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)

       Below  is a sample of how the keymap() action is used to add special keys
       for entering commonly-typed works:

           *VT100.Translations: #override &lt;Key&gt;F13: keymap(dbx)
           *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
                &lt;Key&gt;F14: keymap(None) \n\
                &lt;Key&gt;F17: string(&quot;next&quot;) string(0x0d) \n\
                &lt;Key&gt;F18: string(&quot;step&quot;) string(0x0d) \n\
                &lt;Key&gt;F19: string(&quot;continue&quot;) string(0x0d) \n\
                &lt;Key&gt;F20: string(&quot;print &quot;) insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)

       Some people prefer using the left pointer button for dragging the scroll&#8208;
       bar  thumb.   That  can  be  setup by altering the translations resource,
       e.g.,

           *VT100.scrollbar.translations:#override \n\
                &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                &lt;Btn4Down&gt;:StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                &lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                &lt;BtnUp&gt;:  NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()


CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD
       The Xterm Control Sequences document lists the control sequences which an
       application  can  send xterm to make it perform various operations.  Most
       of these operations are standardized, from either the  DEC  or  Tektronix
       terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.

ENVIRONMENT
       Xterm sets several environment variables:

       DISPLAY
            is  the display name, pointing to the X server (see DISPLAY NAMES in
            X(7)).

       TERM is set according to the termcap (or  terminfo)  entry  which  it  is
            using as a reference.

       WINDOWID
            is set to the X window id number of the xterm window.

       XTERM_LOCALE
            shows  the  locale  which  was used by xterm on startup.  Some shell
            initialization scripts may set a different locale.

       XTERM_SHELL
            is set to the pathname of the program  which  is  invoked.   Usually
            that is a shell program, e.g., /bin/sh.  Since it is not necessarily
            a shell program however, it is distinct from &#8220;SHELL&#8221;.

       XTERM_VERSION
            is set to the string displayed by the -version option.  That is nor&#8208;
            mally  an identifier for the X Window libraries used to build xterm,
            followed by xterm&apos;s patch number in parenthesis.  The  patch  number
            is  also  part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes (DA)
            control sequence (see Xterm Control Sequences).

       Depending on your system configuration, xterm may also set the following:

       COLUMNS
            the width of the xterm in characters (cf: &#8220;stty columns&#8221;).

       HOME when xterm is configured to update utmp.

       LINES
            the height of the xterm in characters (cf: &#8220;stty rows&#8221;).

       LOGNAME
            when xterm is configured to update utmp.

       SHELL
            when xterm is configured to update utmp.  It is also set if you pro&#8208;
            vide the shell name as the optional parameter.

       TERMCAP
            the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to $TERM, with lines
            and columns values substituted for the actual size window  you  have
            created.

       TERMINFO
            may be defined to a nonstandard location in the configure script.

FILES
       The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.
&#12;       /var/run/utmp
            the system logfile, which records user logins.

       /var/log/wtmp
            the system logfile, which records user logins and logouts.

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm
            the xterm default application resources.

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color
            the  xterm  color  application  resources.  If your display supports
            color, use this
                      *customization: -color
            in your .Xdefaults file to  automatically  use  this  resource  file
            rather  than  /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.   If  you do not do this,
            xterm uses its compiled-in default resource settings for colors.

ERROR MESSAGES
       Most of the fatal error messages from xterm use the following format:
              xterm: Error XXX, errno YYY: ZZZ
       The XXX codes (which are used by  xterm  as  its  exit-code)  are  listed
       below, with a brief explanation.

       1    is  used for miscellaneous errors, usually accompanied by a specific
            message,

BUGS
       Large pastes do not work on some systems.  This is not a bug in xterm; it
       is  a  bug  in  the pseudo terminal driver of those systems.  xterm feeds
       large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty  will  accept  data,  but
       some  pty  drivers  do not return enough information to know if the write
       has succeeded.

       When connected to an input method, it is possible for xterm  to  hang  if
       the XIM server is suspended or killed.

       Many of the options are not resettable after xterm starts.

       This  program  still needs to be rewritten.  It should be split into very
       modular sections, with the various emulators  being  completely  separate
       widgets  that  do  not  know about each other.  Ideally, you&apos;d like to be
       able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick  them  into  a  single
       control widget.

       There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.
