XTRLOCK(1)                                                            XTRLOCK(1)



NAME
       xtrlock - Lock X display until password supplied, leaving windows visible

SYNOPSIS
       xtrlock

DESCRIPTION
       xtrlock  locks  the  X  server till the user enters their password at the
       keyboard.

       While xtrlock is running, the mouse and  keyboard  are  grabbed  and  the
       mouse cursor becomes a padlock.  Output displayed by X programs, and win&#8208;
       dows put up by new X clients, continue to be visible, and any new  output
       is displayed normally.

       The  mouse  and keyboard are returned when the user types their password,
       followed by Enter or Newline.  If an incorrect password  is  entered  the
       bell  is sounded.  Pressing Backspace or Delete erases one character of a
       password partially typed; pressing Escape or Clear clears  anything  that
       has been entered.

       If too many attempts are made in too short a time further keystrokes gen&#8208;
       erate bells and are otherwise ignored until a timeout has expired.

       The X server screen saver continues to operate normally; if it comes into
       operation  the  display  may be restored by the usual means of touching a
       key (Shift, for example) or the mouse.

OPTIONS, X RESOURCES, CONFIGURATION
       None.

BUGS
       Additional input devices other than the keyboard and mouse are  not  dis&#8208;
       abled.

       The timeouts, bitmaps and mouse cursor colour cannot be modifed.
