xvkbd(1)                                                                xvkbd(1)



NAME
       xvkbd - virtual keyboard for X window system


DESCRIPTION
       xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X Window System which
       provides facility to enter characters onto other clients  (softwares)  by
       clicking  on  a  keyboard  displayed on the screen.  This may be used for
       systems without a hardware keyboard such as kiosk terminals  or  handheld
       devices.   This program also has facility to send characters specified as
       the command line option to another client.

       The standard keyboard layout is based on the traditional US  layout,  but
       some  other  keyboard layout (see &quot;Screen Shot&quot;) are also supported.  The
       default window size may be too large for systems with small  screen,  but
       it  can  be configured to use smaller space (220x90 pixels, for example).
       For details, see also &quot;Screen Shot&quot; and &quot;How to Customize  xvkbd&quot;  below,
       and resouce files in the distribution.

       xvkbd  version  2.1  and later support word completion, which may make it
       easier to enter long words with xvkbd.

       IMPORTANT NOTE: When invoking xvkbd from display managers  such  as  XDM,
       GDM,  etc., always use xvkbd with -secure option or you will have serious
       security risk.


Environment
       xvkbd will work on X11R5 or X11R6.  It is  tested  on  redhat  Linux  and
       Solaris, and it will work also on most UNIX-like systems.

       This  program  uses  Xaw  (use  of  Xaw3d  is recommended) and no special
       library is required.


Operation
    Input Keys
       When xvkbd is started, the image of a keyboard will be displayed  on  the
       screen.   Clicking any key on the xvkbd window will send the character to
       the focused window as if the key had been actually typed with  the  hard&#8208;
       ware keyboard.

       If  you  want  to  input  upper-case alphabets or other characters on the
       upper position on the keyboard, you should click the key after  selecting
       Shift  by  clicking it, or click the key with mouse button 3 (maybe right
       button) or mouse button 4.  In the similar manner, if you want  to  input
       Controled characters, you should click the key after clicking Control, or
       click the key with mouse button 2 (maybe middle button).   Alt  and  Meta
       can  be  used in the similar manner with Control, but there are no short&#8208;
       cuts with mouse buttons.


    ``Quick Modifiers&apos;&apos;
       xvkbd 2.5 and later support another way to input  characters  with  modi&#8208;
       fiers such as Shift, Control, AltGr, etc., which may be useful especially
       for machines with touch panels such as PDAs - we  would  call  it  &quot;Quick
       Modifiers&quot;.

       Quick  Modifiers  can  be  enabled/disabled  by the ``Enable &quot;Quick Modi&#8208;
       fiers?&apos;&apos; entry on the property panel.  If Quick Modifiers is enabled,  it
       will be activated by pressing a key on the xvkbd window, move the pointer
       outside of the key, and then release the mouse button or equivalent.

       The direction of the pointer motion will select the modifier:

             up        - Shift
             right     - AltGr
             right-up  - Shift AltGr
             left      - Control
             left-up   - Shift Control
             down      - Meta
             left-down - Alt



    Setting Input Focus
       If you are using a window manager and clients where  you  can  set  input
       focus  by clicking mouse button on the window (and you don&apos;t have to keep
       pointer in the window after that), you can simply set input focus in  the
       normal  way  and then click keys on the xvkbd window - the character will
       be sent to the selected position.

       If you are using a window manager or clients  where  you  must  keep  the
       pointer  in  the  input field to input from the keyboard, or if the input
       focus is switched to the xvkbd window when you clicked on the key on  the
       xvkbd window, you must make xvkbd to set input focus explicitly by click&#8208;
       ing the Focus button on the xvkbd window and  then  click  on  the  input
       field.   This  input  focus  can be cleared by clicking Focus button with
       mouse button 3, or simply clicking Focus button twice.


    Word Completion
       Choosing ``Word Completion...&apos;&apos; in the main menu will popup the Word Com&#8208;
       pletion panel.

       When  you entered characters by clicked keys on the xvkbd window as usual
       while the Word Completion panel open, words started with  the  characters
       will  be  listed in the panel, and you can enter the remaining characters
       of the selected word by clicking one of the words in the list.

       The dictionary (list of words) file is /usr/share/dict/words by  default,
       but it can be changed by -dict option or xvkbd.dictFile resouce.


    Main Menu
       Pressing the ``xvkbd&apos;&apos; logo on the main keyboard (placed near left-bottom
       corner in the default configuration) will popup the main menu.

       The menu contains following items:

           Toggle locking/momentary of Control, Alt and Meta keys.

       Always on Top?
           If  this  entry  is  set  ON, xvkbd attempts to keep the xvkbd window
           always on the top of the display (i.e. not to be hidden by other win&#8208;
           dows).   This  feature  is  experimental, and care should be taken as
           this feature can cause problem in some situations.

       Use XTEST Extension?
           XTEST extension will be used if this entry is checked.  If this entry
           is set inactive, the X server does not support XTEST extension.

       Jump Pointer?
           If this entry is set ON, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer to the
           focused window, if XTEST extension is to be used to simulate keyboard
           events.

       Key-Click Sound
           Set on/off and duration of key-click sound.

       Automatic Click
           Set  on/off of the automatic click feature and the delay before auto&#8208;
           matic click is activated.  If this feature is set, xvkbd will work as
           if left mouse button is clicked when mouse pointer is moved on a but&#8208;
           ton and stays long enough.  You may want to set Jump Pointer? to  OFF
           to avoid auto-repeating.


    Options
       xvkbd  accept  following  command  line  options,  in addition to general
       options such as `-display&apos;.

       -xsendevent
           Make xvkbd to use XSendEvent() to simulate keyboard events, as it was
           in  xvkbd  version  1.0.  xvkbd version 1.1 and later will try to use
           XTEST extension instead in the default configuration.
           If XTEST extension is not supported by the X server, xvkbd will auto&#8208;
           matically switch to this mode.
           Resource `xvkbd.xtest: false&apos; has the same function.

       -no-sync
           Normally,  xvkbd  attempts to synchronize with the destinating client
           step by step.  This can cause problem  when  the  client  (or  the  X
           server)  responded  too slow.  In such situation, maybe this -no-sync
           can solve the problem.
           Resource `xvkbd.noSync: true&apos; has the same function.

       -no-jump-pointer
           Make xvkbd not to jump the  pointer  when  sending  events.   In  the
           default, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer to the focused window,
           if input focus is set explicitly via Focus button, and  XTEST  exten&#8208;
           sion is to be used to simulate keyboard events.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointer: false&apos; has the same function.

       -no-back-pointer
           Make  xvkbd  not  to  jump  the pointer back to the original position
           after events has been sent.  Maybe this  can  be  useful  when  using
           xvkbd to move the pointer position.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointerBack: false&apos; has the same function.

       -modal
           Make  labels  on keys in the xvkbd window to be set independently for
           each of four shift states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and Shift-AltGr.
           This is useful when you want to make the xvkbd window very small.
           See  also &quot;Customizing Keyboard Layout&quot; and resouce files in the dis&#8208;
           tribution.
           Resource `xvkbd.modalKeytop: true&apos; has the same function.

       -geometry  [widthxheight][+xoff+yoff]
           Set window geometry (size and position).
           You can use form like -geometry 400x130 to specify the  window  size,
           -geometry  +100+100 to specify the window position from left/top edge
           of the screen, and -geometry 400x130+100+100 to specify both the size
           and the position.  You can specify position from right/bottom edge of
           the screen by using - instead of +, but please  note  that  you  must
           take  account of size of the window border.  (If you specify `-geome&#8208;
           try -0-0&apos;, the window will not fit in the screen.)
           This can be set by xvkbd.windowGeometry resource (note that it is not
           xvkbd.geometry), too.

       -no-repeat
           Do not auto-repeat even if key is depressed long time.
           If  auto-repeat  is  enabled (this is the default), time before start
           auto-repeat can be set  as  `xvkbd*Repeater.initialDelay:  600&apos;,  and
           period  of  repeat  can  be set as `xvkbd*Repeater.minimumDelay: 100&apos;
           (unit of there parameters are milli-seconds).
           Resource `xvkbd.autoRepeat: false&apos; has the same function.

       -no-functionkey
           Do not display function keys.
           Resource `xvkbd.functionkey: false&apos; has the same function.

       -no-keypad
           Do not display keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypad: false&apos; has the same function.

       -compact
           Do not display function keys nor keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.compact: true&apos; has the same function.

       -keypad
           Display only keypad.  This option will be ignored if `-no-keypad&apos;  or
           `-compact&apos; is specified.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadOnly: true&apos; has the same function.

       -text string
           Send the string to the focused window (see also `-window&apos; option).
           If  this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and ter&#8208;
           minate soon after sending the string.
           The string can contain:

           - \r - Return

           - \t - Tab

           - \b - Backspace

           - \e - Escape

           - \d - Delete

           - \S - Shift (modify the next character; please note that modify with
             ``\S&apos;&apos; will be ignored in many cases.  For example, ``a\Cb\ScD\CE&apos;&apos;
             will be interpreted as a, Control-b, c, Shift-D, and Control-Shift-
             E.)

           - \C - Control (modify the next character)

           - \A - Alt (modify the next character)

           - \M - Meta (modify the next character)

           - \[keysym] - the keysym keysym (e.g., \[Left])

           - \Ddigit - delay digit * 100 ms

           - \xvalue - move mouse pointer (use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; for relative motion)

           - \yvalue - move mouse pointer (use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; for relative motion)

           - \mdigit - simulate click of the specified mouse button

       -file filename
           Send  the  contents  of the specified file to the focused window (see
           also `-window&apos; option).  If ``-&apos;&apos;  was  specified  as  the  filename,
           string to be sent will be read from the standard input (stdin).
           If  this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and ter&#8208;
           minate soon after sending the string.

       -delay value
           Put value ms of delay for every  character  when  sending  characters
           with  -text  or -file.  Maybe this is useful when problem arises when
           characters are entered too fast.

       -window window
           Specify the ID (hexadecimal value leaded with `0x&apos;, or decimal value)
           or  name  (instance  name  or  class name) of the window to set input
           focus.  If this is not specified, xvkbd will use  input  focus  under
           control  of  the window manager, unless focus is specified explicitly
           via Focus button.  Even if this option  is  specified,  you  can  set
           input  focus  to other windows using Focus button, or clear the input
           focus.
           If there are two or more windows which have the name  specified  with
           this option, the window which was found first will be selected.

       -widget widget-name
           Specify  the  name of the widget to set the input focus.  To use this
           feature, the client must support Editres protocol.  In general,  this
           option will be used with `-window&apos; option.
           If  you  want  to  set input focus to the widget foo.bar.zot, you can
           write zot, bar.zot or foo.bar.zot as widget-name.   To  avoid  confu&#8208;
           sion,  the  widget-name  should  match  with  a  single widget of the
           client.
           For example,

               xvkbd -window xarchie -widget searchText -text &quot;\Ca\Ckabc\r&quot;

           will enter the string ``abc&apos;&apos; to  the  ``Search  Term&apos;&apos;  field  of  a
           xarchie window.

       -true-keypad
           If  this  option is specified, xvkbd will attempt to use keysyms such
           as XK_KP_1 instead of XK_1.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadKeysym: true&apos; has the same function.

       -dict filename
           Specify the dictionary (list of words) file to be used for word  com&#8208;
           pletion.
           Resource `xvkbd.dictFile: filename&apos; has the same function.
           See also ``Making your own completion dictionary&apos;&apos;.

       -minimizable
           Make xvkbd window can be minimized (iconified) even if no window man&#8208;
           ager is in use.  When this feature is enabled, small triangle will be
           displayed  at  left  ot the xvkbd main menu, and xvkbd window will be
           minimized when the triangle is clicked.
           Resource `xvkbd.minimizable: true&apos; has the same function.

       -secure
           Disable invocation of external commands, including user assigned com&#8208;
           mand  and  the  online manual reader.  Connection to another displays
           would also be disabled.  This option may be useful when xvkbd  is  to
           be run with some kind of privileges.
           Resource `xvkbd.secure: true&apos; has the same function.

       -nonexitable
           Disable  termination of the xvkbd program.  This option may be useful
           when xvkbd is to be run automatically for systems with  no  keyboards
           and users should not terminate the xvkbd.
           Resource `xvkbd.nonexitable: true&apos; has the same function.

       -xdm
           Same  as  -secure  -nonexitable.   When  xvkbd is to be run for login
           screen, it would be suggested to use this option.

       -modifiers modifiers
           Normally, xvkbd will activate modifiers (control, shift, etc.)   only
           whille  sending  characters.   If  modifiers were specified with this
           option, the specified modifiers will be activated while corresponding
           key  on  the xvkbd window is in active.  For example, you can specify
           -modifiers shift,control,meta,alt to apply this for those four  modi&#8208;
           fiers.   Maybe  this  can  be  useful when attempting to decorate the
           mouse operations with the modifiers.  Please note that the  modifiers
           will also be applied when attempting to click on the xvkbd window and
           which can prevent the correct operation in some situations.
           Resource `xvkbd.positiveModifiers: modifiers...&apos; has the  same  func&#8208;
           tion.

           - source of version 2.9 (2008-03-30)

       xvkbd is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.


Install
         o untar the source in a directory, and move to the directory

         o If  you  wish  to use genuine Xaw insead of Xaw3d, edit Imakefile and
           remove (or comment-out) `#define XAW3D&apos;.
           When you are installing xvkbd (for example) in very old systems,  you
           may also want to remove `#define XTEST&apos; and `#define I18N&apos; to disable
           XTEST and internationalization facility respectively.

         o Run xmkmf; make install install.man


Customization
    How to Customize xvkbd
       Some degree of customization of xvkbd is possible by  setting  resources.
       Some  resources are already described above, and resources to customizing
       keyboard layout are described below.

       To set resources, you can:

         o put them in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or

         o load them via xrdb(1), or

         o set the filename to the $XENVIRONMENT environment variable, or

         o put them in application default directory as `XVkbd-suffix&apos;  and  set
           resource ``xvkbd.customization: -suffix&apos;&apos;, or

         o put them in application default directory as XVkbd.

       Here, application default directory can be either of:

         o directories  specified with $XUSERFILESEACHPATH, $XAPPLRESDIR or else
           $HOME environment variable

         o system&apos;s application default directory specified with $XFILESEACHPATH
           environment  variable, or else the directory specified when compiling
           the X (e.g., /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults)

       When the application default file is to be stored in the system&apos;s  appli&#8208;
       cation  default  directory,  the file must contain ``#include &quot;XVkbd-com&#8208;
       mon&quot;&apos;&apos; near top of the file.

       xvkbd is distributed with some application default files, and  they  will
       be installed in the system&apos;s application default directory.


    Making Window Small
       Size  (and position) of xvkbd window can be set by `xvkbd.windowGeometry&apos;
       resource.  When making window small, you may need to choose  the  smaller
       font, too.

             xvkbd.windowGeometry: 220x90
             xvkbd.compact: true
             xvkbd*Font: 6x12


       You may also want to set:

             xvkbd.modalKeytop: true

       to display only the labels for the current shift state, instead of trying
       to always display all of them in the small keytop.

       See also XVkbd-small.ad in the xvkbd distribution.


    Removing Unwanted Keys
       Keys on xvkbd window can be removed by setting its width to 1.

       To remove Compose key and make Shift key larger, you can write:

             xvkbd*Multi_key.width: 1
             xvkbd*Shift_R.width: 75


       To remove right Alt and Meta key, you can write:

             xvkbd*Alt_R.width: 1
             xvkbd*Meta_R.width: 1



    Customizing Keyboard Layout
       Layout of keys on the xvkbd  window  can  be  customized  with  following
       resources:

       xvkbd.NormalKeys
           list of keys available when neighter of Shift and AltGr are selected

       xvkbd.ShiftKeys
           list of keys available when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeys
           list of keys available when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeys
           list of keys available when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       xvkbd.KeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys

       xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when neither of Shift and AltGr are selected.

       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       Four   resources  to  set  labels  on  the  keys  (xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels,
       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels, xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels and xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeyLabels)
       will  be  used instead of xvkbd.KeyLabels when xvkbd.modalKeytop resoruce
       is set true.

       In all of those resources, each keys are separated by spaces, and rows of
       keys  are  terminated  with ` \n\&apos; (note that `\n&apos; must have space before
       it).  Please refer XVkbd-german.ad and XVkbd-latin1.ad in the xvkbd  dis&#8208;
       tribution for more about these resources.

       XVkbd-german  and XVkbd-latin1 will be installed in the system&apos;s applica&#8208;
       tion default directory, and setting the  resource  ``xvkbd.customization:
       -german&apos;&apos;  will  make xvkbd to use the German layout.  For another method
       to activate those settings, please refer &quot;How to Customize xvkbd&quot; above.


    Assigning Text to Function Keys
       Text can be assigned to each function keys (and, actually, to most  other
       keys).  If text is assigned to the function key, clicking on the key will
       send the assigned text instead of the function key itself.  When  pointer
       is  on  a key where text is assigned, the text will be displayed near the
       key.

       The setting will be read from a text file which contains  text  for  each
       function keys as:

             F1 text for F1
             F2 text for F2
             s:F1 text for Shift-F1
             c:F1 text for Control-F1
             m:F1 text for Meta-F1
             a:F1 text for Alt-F1
             ...


       `s:&apos;,  `c:&apos;,  `m:&apos; and `a:&apos; before the keys name indicates four modifiers
       (Shift, Control, Meta and Alt) respectively.

       If the first character of the assigned string is `!&apos;, the string will  be
       used  as command to be executed when the key is clicked.  String starting
       with `!&apos; can be assigned by putting `\&apos; before `!&apos;.

       The file is $HOME/.xvkbd in default, and it can be changed by setting the
       filename with xvkbd.keyFile resource.

       For  F1 to F12 with or without Shift modifier, it is possible to edit the
       assigned string on a panel popped up via &quot;Edit Function Keys...&quot;  in  the
       main menu.


Miscellaneous Informations
    Notes
         o On  XFree86, resolution switch with Ctrl + Alt + Keypad-Plus and Ctrl
           + Alt + Keypad-Minus  may  be  simulated.   However,  Ctrl  +  Alt  +
           Backspace will not be simulated.

         o Shift  is  used  to decide key to be sent and it will not used to set
           modifier bit when sending the event.  You  can  use  xev  command  to
           check what is actually sent.

         o If  Alt  or Meta is not defined as modifier, the key can&apos;t be used as
           modifier.  You can use `xmodmap  -pm&apos;  to  check  how  modifiers  are
           defined.

         o Num Lock (and maybe other modifiers) on the physical keyboard may not
           work correctly when xvkbd is in use.

             The first release, not announced anywhere.

       Version 0.2 (2000-09-15)

           - Compose key is added.  In the environments  where  Compose  key  is
             supported,  some  characters  (mainly  letters  with accent symbol)
             which can&apos;t be entered directly from keyboard can be entered  using
             dedicated key combinations.
&#12;           - Make keyboard layout not to be disturbed when window size if speci&#8208;
             fied with -geometry option.

       Version 0.3 (2000-10-05)

           - -text option can now accept some modifiers (\S, \C, etc.)  and  any
             keysyms (\[keysym]).

           - In  addition to the window ID, -window option can now accept window
             name.

           - New -widget option to specify the widget to set the input focus.

       Version 1.0 (2000-11-03)

           - Keyboard layout can be now configured with  resources.   See  &quot;Cus&#8208;
             tomizing Keyboard Layout&quot; above, and XVkbd-german.ad in the distri&#8208;
             bution.

           - xvkbd can now send keys with Mode_switch  (AltGr)  modifier,  which
             enables those characters in the position to be entered.

           - xvkbd  now  support  AltGr key so that German (and some other) key&#8208;
             board layout can be used.  See XVkbd-german.ad in the distribution.

           - XVkbd-german and XVkbd-latin1 are  included  in  the  distribution,
             which  modifies  keyboard layout and put some non-ASCII keys on the
             xvkbd window.

           - CapsLock key is supported now.

       Version 1.1 (2000-12-23)

           - xvkbd can now use XTEST extension to simulate keyboard events.   It
             can  still  use  XSendEvent(),  as  it  was  in  the older release.
             (thanks, Bjoern)

           - Labels on keys can now be set independently for each of four  shift
             states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and Shift-AltGr.  (thanks, Jim)

           - -kterm option and xvkbd.kterm resource are removed.

       Version 1.2 (2001-02-18)

           - Focus  button  is  now placed in the main keyboard, too, so that it
             will be available also in compact mode.  If you don&apos;t need  it,  it
             can be removed by setting ``xvkbd*row5.Focus.width: 1&apos;&apos;.

           - Input focus set by Focus button can now be cleard by clicking Focus
             button twice.  Clicking Focus button with mouse button 3 will still
             clear the input focus, too.

           - Text  can  now be assigned to function keys (and, actually, to most
             other keys).

           - It is now possible to assign keys modified with Shift, Control, Alt
             and Meta on the main keyboard, by putting `s:&apos;, `c:&apos;, `a:&apos; and `m:&apos;
             before those keysym name when customizing the keyboard layout.

           - xvkbd now ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT so that it will not terminated
             accidently.

       Version 1.3 (2001-03-19)

           - New  app-defaults  file  for  Swiss-German  layout, XVkbd-swissger&#8208;
             man.ad.  (contributed from Marcel Portner)

           - xvkbd now catches MappingNotify event and reload the  new  mapping.
             This allows users to use xmodmap while xvkbd is running.

           - NumLock  key is supported now.  (I&apos;d removed Print, ScrLk and Pause
             from keypad - somebody need them?)

       Version 1.4 (2001-04-22)

           - Auto-repeat didn&apos;t work when focus was  set  explicitly  via  Focus
             button.  It is now fixed.

           - When  required  keysym  was  not defined in the keymap table, xvkbd
             will now add it on-the-fly.  This means that we don&apos;t have  to  add
             them via xmodmap.

           - Keypad panel can now be popped up from the main keyboard as a sepa&#8208;
             rate window.

           - Sun function keys is now supported.  It can be popped up  from  the
             main keyboard as a separate window.

           - Manual page is now available.

       Version 1.5 (2001-10-08)

           - Key  events  can  now  be sent to windows on a remote display (i.e.
             windows on other X servers) - use &quot;Connect to Remote Display...&quot; in
             the main menu to connect to remote display.

           - Shift,  Control, Alt and Meta can now be locked - use &quot;Lock Shift?&quot;
             and &quot;Lock Control, Alt and Meta?&quot;  in the main menu.  Those initial
             settings  can  be  set  by  xvkbd.shiftLock and xvkbd.modifiersLock
             resource.

           - If the first keysym for a key is an alphabet and the second  keysym
             is NoSymbol, it is now interpreted as if the first keysym is lower&#8208;
             case alphabet and the second keysym is uppercase alphabet.   Keymap
             may  be  defined in this way in some systems including Solaris, and
             older xvkbd may not work correctly in such situation.

       Version 1.6 (2001-11-10)

           - New `-file&apos; option  to  send  characters  in  the  specified  file.
             (thanks, Gregory)

           - New  entry `Use XTEST Extension?&apos; is added to the main menu, mainly
             to indicate the availability of the XTEST extension.

           - xvkbd would crash when the window explicitly focused via Focus but&#8208;
             ton becomes was destroyed.  This problem is now fixed.

       Version 2.0 (2001-12-09)

           - Keyboard  layout (default, German, French, etc.) can now be changed
             after xvkbd is invoked.

           - Show/hide of the keypad and funcion keys on the main window can now
             be toggled from the main menu.

           - New  app-defaults  file  for French layout, XVkbd-french.ad.  (con&#8208;
             tributed from Jean-Pierre Demailly)

       Version 2.1 (2002-01-27)

           - When height of the xvkbd window is smaller than  XVkbd.modalThresh&#8208;
             old,  xvkbd  will  now automatically switch the keytop as if -modal
             option was specified.

           - \[keysym] in -text option would send wrong keys - this  problem  is
             now fixed.

           - Target  distclean in the Imakefile is renamed to avoid the possible
             confusion on some systems.

           - Word completion is now supported.

       Version 2.2 (2002-03-17)

           - String assigned to function keys can  now  be  edited  on  a  panel
             popped up via &quot;Edit Function Keys...&quot; in the main menu.

           - When  ``-&apos;&apos;  was  specified  as  the  filename  parameter for -file
             option, xvkbd will now read its standard input (stdin) to  get  the
             string to be sent.

           - In  the  previous release, less-portable setenv() function was used
             instead of putenv() function, may cause compilation error  on  some
             systems including Solaris.

       Version 2.3 (2002-04-05)

           - New  &quot;Dead  Keys&quot;  panel  added.   Which can be used to enter Latin
             characters with accent symbol in double stroke.

           - More localized keyboard layout: Belgian,  Danish,  French,  German,
             Icelandic,  Italian,  Japanese (JIS-X-6004), Norwegian, Portuguese,
             Spanish, Swedish, Swiss/German, United Kingdom and Latin-1.

           - -keypad option would crash previous version of xvkbd - this problem
             is now fixed.

       Version 2.4 (2002-10-02)

           - Command  can  now  be assigned to function keys so that clicking on
             the function key will execute the command instead  of  sending  the
             string to clients.

           - Assigned string for F1 to F12 with Shift modifier can now be edited
             on a panel popped up via &quot;Edit Function Keys...&quot; in the main menu.

       Version 2.5 (2002-10-12)

           - Quick Modifier feature added - now, it is possible to enter charac&#8208;
             ters  with  modifiers  by pressing a key and then move the pointer.
             (suggested by Niklas Rokaeus)

           - ``Lock AltGr?&apos;&apos; entry is added in the main menu.

           - Status of ``Lock Shift?&apos;&apos;, ``Lock AltGr&apos;&apos;, ``Lock Control, Alt  and
             Meta?&apos;&apos;  will  be recorded in $HOME/.xvkbd file and it will be read
             when xvkbd is invoked next time.

       Version 2.5a (2003-06-25)

           - ``Fitaly&apos;&apos; layout is now supported - may be useful for PDAs.

       Version 2.6 (2004-05-04)

           - Code to adding keysyms which were not found in the keymap table  is
             revised.  xvkbd now avoid to add keysyms in the shifted position of
             keys which already have a keysym defined in the  non-shifted  posi&#8208;
             tion,  and  entries in the keymap table which is modified keys will
             be redefined rather than redefining the entire keymap table.   This
             change is to avoid possible problem (AltGr key could be effectively
             disabled) which may caused in some systems  where  XGetKeyboardMap&#8208;
             ping()  can  produce  incorrect  map  when  keys have more then two
             keysyms.

           - If  Mode_switch  is  not  defined  in  the   modifier   table   but
             ISO_Level3_Shift  is  defined, xvkbd now attempt to add Mode_switch
             as the same modifier with ISO_Level3_Shift.

           - Korean layout is now supported.  Although Hangul characters will be
             displayed  on the keys, xvkbd will simply generate alphabet charac&#8208;
             ters when those keys are clicked.  It is intented to be  used  with
             &quot;ami&quot; or similar Hangul input program.

           - URL  of  the  xvkbd  main  page  is  now  changes  to  http://home&#8208;
             page3.nifty.com/tsato/xvkbd/.

       Version 2.7 (2005-05-05)

           - Yet another Japanese keyboard layout, JIS X 6002, is now supported.

           - It is now possible to minimize (iconify) the main window even if no
             window  manager is in use.  This feature can be activated by -mini&#8208;
             mizable option or xvkbd.minimizable resource.

           - Experimental code to keep the xvkbd window always on the top of the
             display.   This  feature can be activated by -always-on-top option,
             xvkbd.alwaysOnTop resource or the &quot;Always on  Top?&quot;  entry  in  the
             main  menu.  Care should be taken as this feature can cause problem
             in some situations.

           - -text option now support combinations of modifiers  and  a  special
             key.   For  example,  -text  &apos;\C\A\d&apos;  can be used for Control-Alt-
             Delete key combination.

           - New options: -secure option (xvkbd.secure resource) which  disables
             invocation  of external commands, -nonexitable option (xvkbd.nonex&#8208;
             itable resource) which inhibits termination  of  the  program,  and
             -xdm  option  which is equivalent to -secure -nonexitable and maybe
             useful when run xvkbd from a display manager.

       Version 2.7a (2005-05-07)

           - Fixed a problem  that  xvkbd  could  cause  segmentation  fault  on
             startup.

       Version 2.8 (2006-09-10)

           - ISO_Level3_Shift  is  now  to  be prefered over Mode_switch so that
             AltGr can be used on relatively  new  systems  where  we  must  use
             ISO_Level3_Shift instead of Mode_switch.

           - Reference    to    the    target    bitmap    is    changed    from
             /usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps/target   to    /usr/include/X11/bit&#8208;
             maps/target.

           - New options: -no-back-pointer, -no-sync, -modifiers.

           - Russian (Cyrillic) keyboard layout supported. (thanks, Victor)

           - New -delay option.

           - \D special sequence in -text can be used to put a delay in specific
             position.

           - -text can now simulate mouse operation via \x, \y  and  \m  special
             sequences.
