NAME
       vncviewer - an X viewer client for VNC

SYNOPSIS
       vncviewer [options] [host][:display]
       vncviewer [options] [host][::port]
       vncviewer [options] -listen [display]
       vncviewer -help

DESCRIPTION
       vncviewer  is an Xt-based client application for the VNC (Virtual Network
       Computing) system. It can connect to any VNC-compatible  server  such  as
       Xvnc  or WinVNC, allowing you to control desktop environment of a differ&#8208;
       ent machine.

       You can use F8 to display a pop-up utility menu. Press F8 twice  to  pass
       single F8 to the remote side.

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a short usage notice to stderr.

       -listen
              Make  the  viewer  listen on port 5500+display for reverse connec&#8208;
              tions from a server. WinVNC supports reverse connections using the
              &quot;Add New Client&quot; menu option, or the -connect command line option.
              Xvnc requires the use of the helper program vncconnect.

       -via gateway
              Automatically create encrypted TCP tunnel to the  gateway  machine
              before  connection,  connect  to  the  host  through  that  tunnel
              (TightVNC-specific). By default, this  option  invokes  SSH  local
              port  forwarding,  assuming that SSH client binary can be accessed
              as /usr/bin/ssh. Note that when using the -via  option,  the  host
              machine  name should be specified as known to the gateway machine,
              e.g.  &quot;localhost&quot; denotes  the  gateway,  not  the  machine  where
              vncviewer  was launched. See the ENVIRONMENT section below for the
              information on configuring the -via option.

       -shared
              When connecting, specify that a shared connection is requested. In
              TightVNC,  this  is  the  default  mode, allowing you to share the
              desktop with other clients already using it.

       -noshared
              When connecting, specify that the session may not be shared.  This
              would  either  disconnect  other  connected clients or refuse your
              connection, depending on the server configuration.

       -viewonly
              Disable transfer of mouse and keyboard events from the  client  to
              the server.

       -fullscreen
              Start  in  full-screen  mode.  Please  be  aware that operating in
              full-screen mode may confuse X window  managers.  Typically,  such
              conflicts  cause  incorrect  handling  of  input focus or make the
              viewer window disappear mysteriously. See the grabKeyboard setting
              in  the  RESOURCES section below for a method to solve input focus
              problem.

       -noraiseonbeep
              By default, the viewer shows and raises its window on remote  beep
              (bell)  event.  This option disables such behaviour (TightVNC-spe&#8208;
              cific).

       -user username
              User name for Unix login authentication. Default is to use current
              Unix  user  name. If this option was given, the viewer will prefer
              Unix login authentication over the standard VNC authentication.

       -passwd passwd-file
              File from which to get the password  (as  generated  by  the  vnc&#8208;
              passwd(1)  program).  This  option  affects  only the standard VNC
              authentication.

       -encodings encoding-list
              TightVNC supports several different compression methods to  encode
              screen  updates;  this  option  specifies  a set of them to use in
              order of preference. Encodings are specified separated  with  spa&#8208;
              ces, and must thus be enclosed in quotes if more than one is spec&#8208;
              ified. Available encodings, in default order for a remote  connec&#8208;
              tion, are &quot;copyrect tight hextile zlib corre rre raw&quot;. For a local
              connection (to the same machine), the default order to try is &quot;raw
              copyrect  tight  hextile  zlib  corre rre&quot;. Raw encoding is always
              assumed as a last option if no other encoding can be used for some
              reason.  For more information on encodings, see the section ENCOD&#8208;
              INGS below.

       -bgr233
              Always use the BGR233 format to encode pixel  data.  This  reduces
              network  traffic,  but colors may be represented inaccurately. The
              bgr233 format is an 8-bit &quot;true color&quot; format, with 2 bits blue, 3
              bits green, and 3 bits red.

       -owncmap
              Try  to  use  a  PseudoColor  visual  and a private colormap. This
              allows the VNC server to control the colormap.

       -truecolour, -truecolor
              Try to use a TrueColor visual.

       -depth depth
              On an X server which supports multiple TrueColor visuals  of  dif&#8208;
              ferent  depths,  attempt  to  use  the  specified one (in bits per
              pixel); if successful, this depth will be requested from  the  VNC
              server.

       -compresslevel level
              Use  specified  compression  level  (0..9)  for &quot;tight&quot; and &quot;zlib&quot;
              encodings (TightVNC-specific). Level 1 uses minimum  of  CPU  time
              and  achieves  weak  compression ratios, while level 9 offers best
              compression but is slow in terms of CPU time  consumption  on  the
              server  side.  Use high levels with very slow network connections,
              and low levels when working over high-speed LANs. It&apos;s not  recom&#8208;
              mended  to  use compression level 0, reasonable choices start from
              the level 1.

       -quality level
              Use the specified JPEG quality level (0..9) for the &quot;tight&quot; encod&#8208;
              ing (TightVNC-specific). Quality level 0 denotes bad image quality
              but very impressive compression ratios, while level 9 offers  very
              good  image  quality  at  lower  compression ratios. Note that the
              &quot;tight&quot; encoder uses JPEG to encode only those screen  areas  that
              look  suitable  for lossy compression, so quality level 0 does not
              always mean unacceptable image quality.

       -nojpeg
              Disable lossy JPEG compression in  Tight  encoding  (TightVNC-spe&#8208;
              cific).   Disabling JPEG compression is not a good idea in typical
              cases, as that makes the Tight encoder less efficient.  You  might
              want  to  use  this option if it&apos;s absolutely necessary to achieve
              perfect image quality (see also the -quality option).

       -nocursorshape
              Disable cursor shape updates, protocol extensions used  to  handle
              remote  cursor movements locally on the client side (TightVNC-spe&#8208;
              cific). Using cursor shape updates decreases  delays  with  remote
              cursor movements, and can improve bandwidth usage dramatically.

       -x11cursor
              Use  a  real X11 cursor with X-style cursor shape updates, instead
              of drawing the remote cursor on the framebuffer. This option  also
              disables  the  dot cursor, and disables cursor position updates in
              non-fullscreen mode.

       -autopass
              Read a plain-text password from stdin. This  option  affects  only
              the standard VNC authentication.

ENCODINGS
       The  server  supplies  information  in  whatever format is desired by the
       client, in order to make the client as easy as possible to implement.  If
       the  client represents itself as able to use multiple formats, the server
       will choose one.

       Pixel format refers to the representation of  an  individual  pixel.  The
       most  common  formats  are  24  and 16 bit &quot;true-color&quot; values, and 8-bit
       &quot;color map&quot; representations, where an arbitrary map  converts  the  color
       number to RGB values.

       Encoding refers to how a rectangle of pixels are sent (all pixel informa&#8208;
       tion in VNC is sent as rectangles). All rectangles  come  with  a  header
       giving  the  location and size of the rectangle and an encoding type used
       by the data which follows. These types are listed below.

       Raw    The raw encoding  simply  sends  width*height  pixel  values.  All
              clients  are  required  to support this encoding type. Raw is also
              the fastest when the server and viewer are on the same machine, as
              the connection speed is essentially infinite and raw encoding min&#8208;
              imizes processing time.

       CopyRect
              The Copy Rectangle encoding is efficient when something  is  being
              moved;  the  only  data  sent  is the location of a rectangle from
              which data should be copied  to  the  current  location.  Copyrect
              could also be used to efficiently transmit a repeated pattern.

       RRE    The  Rise-and-Run-length-Encoding  is  basically  a  2D version of
              run-length encoding (RLE). In this encoding, a sequence of identi&#8208;
              cal  pixels  are compressed to a single value and repeat count. In
              VNC, this is implemented with a background color, and then  speci&#8208;
              fications  of  an  arbitrary number of subrectangles and color for
              each. This is an efficient encoding for large blocks  of  constant
              color.

       CoRRE  This is a minor variation on RRE, using a maximum of 255x255 pixel
              rectangles. This allows for single-byte values to be used,  reduc&#8208;
              ing  packet  size.  This is in general more efficient, because the
              savings from sending 1-byte values generally outweighs the  losses
              from  the  (relatively  rare)  cases  where very large regions are
              painted the same color.

       Hextile
              Here, rectangles are split up in to 16x16 tiles, which are sent in
              a  predetermined  order.  The data within the tiles is sent either
              raw or as a variant on RRE. Hextile encoding is usually  the  best
              choice for using in high-speed network environments (e.g. Ethernet
              local-area networks).

       Zlib   Zlib is a very simple encoding that uses zlib library to  compress
              raw  pixel data. This encoding achieves good compression, but con&#8208;
              sumes a lot of CPU time. Support for this encoding is provided for
              compatibility  with  VNC  servers  that might not understand Tight
              encoding which is more efficient than Zlib in nearly all real-life
              situations.

       Tight  Like  Zlib  encoding, Tight encoding uses zlib library to compress
              the pixel data, but it pre-processes data to maximize  compression
              ratios,  and to minimize CPU usage on compression. Also, JPEG com&#8208;
              pression may be used to encode color-rich screen  areas  (see  the
              description of -quality and -nojpeg options above). Tight encoding
              is usually the best choice for low-bandwidth network  environments
              (e.g. slow modem connections).

RESOURCES
       X  resources  that  vncviewer  knows  about,  aside  from  the  normal Xt
       resources, are as follows:

       shareDesktop
              Equivalent of -shared/-noshared options. Default true.

              Equivalent of -fullscreen option. Default false.

       grabKeyboard
              Grab keyboard in full-screen mode. This can help to solve problems
              with losing keyboard focus. Default false.

       userLogin
              Equivalent of -user option.

       passwordDialog
              Whether to use a dialog box to get the password (true) or  get  it
              from  the  tty (false). Irrelevant if passwordFile is set. Default
              false.

       encodings
              Equivalent of -encodings option.

       compressLevel
              Equivalent of -compresslevel option (TightVNC-specific).

       qualityLevel
              Equivalent of -quality option (TightVNC-specific).

       enableJPEG
              Equivalent of -nojpeg option, when set to false. Default true.

       useRemoteCursor
              Equivalent  of  -nocursorshape   option,   when   set   to   false

       useBGR233
              Equivalent of -bgr233 option. Default false.
&#12;       nColours
              When  using  BGR233, try to allocate this many &quot;exact&quot; colors from
              the BGR233 color cube. When using a shared colormap, setting  this
              resource  lower leaves more colors for other X clients. Irrelevant
              when using truecolor. Default is 256 (i.e. all of them).

       useSharedColours
              If the number of &quot;exact&quot; BGR233 colors successfully  allocated  is
              less than 256 then the rest are filled in using the &quot;nearest&quot; col&#8208;
              ors available. This resource says whether to only use the  &quot;exact&quot;
              BGR233  colors  for this purpose, or whether to use other clients&apos;
              &quot;shared&quot; colors as well. Default true  (i.e.  use  other  clients&apos;
              colors).

       useSharedMemory
              Use  MIT  shared  memory extension if on the same machine as the X
              server. Default true.

       wmDecorationWidth, wmDecorationHeight
              The total width and height taken up by window manager decorations.
              This  is used to calculate the maximum size of the VNC viewer win&#8208;
              dow.  Default is width 4, height 24.

       bumpScrollTime, bumpScrollPixels
              When in full screen mode and the VNC desktop is bigger than the  X
              display, scrolling happens whenever the mouse hits the edge of the
              screen. The maximum speed of scrolling is bumpScrollPixels  pixels
              every  bumpScrollTime  milliseconds. The actual speed of scrolling
              will be slower than this, of course, depending on  how  fast  your
              machine is.  Default 20 pixels every 25 milliseconds.

       popupButtonCount
              The number of buttons in the popup window. See the README file for
              more information on how to customize the buttons.

       debug  For debugging. Default false.

       rawDelay, copyRectDelay
              For debugging, see the README file for details. Default 0 (off).

ENVIRONMENT
       When started with the -via option, vncviewer reads the VNC_VIA_CMD  envi&#8208;
       ronment  variable, expands patterns beginning with the &quot;%&quot; character, and
       executes result as a command assuming that it  would  create  TCP  tunnel
       that  should  be  used  for  VNC connection. If not set, this environment
       variable defaults to &quot;/usr/bin/ssh -f -L %L:%H:%R %G sleep 20&quot;.

       The following patterns are recognized in the VNC_VIA_CMD (note  that  all
       the patterns %G, %H, %L and %R must be present in the command template):

       %%     A literal &quot;%&quot;;

       %G     gateway host name;

       %H     remote VNC host name, as known to the gateway;

       %L     local TCP port number;

       %R     remote TCP port number.
