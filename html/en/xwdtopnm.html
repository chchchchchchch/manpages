NAME
       xwdtopnm - convert a X11 or X10 window dump file into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       xwdtopnm [xwdfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a X11 or X10 window dump file as input.  Produces a portable anymap
       as output.  The type of the output file depends on the input  file  -  if
       it&apos;s  black  &amp; white, a pbm file is written, else if it&apos;s grayscale a pgm
       file, else a ppm file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

       Using this program, you can convert anything on an X workstation&apos;s screen
       into  an  anymap.  Just display whatever you&apos;re interested in, do an xwd,
       run it through xwdtopnm, and then use pnmcut to select the part you want.

BUGS
       I haven&apos;t tested this tool with very many configurations,  so  there  are
       probably bugs.  Please let me know if you find any.
