NAME
       xwud - image displayer for X

SYNOPSIS
       xwud  [-in  file]  [-noclick]  [-geometry geom] [-display display] [-new]
       [-std &lt;maptype&gt;] [-raw] [-vis &lt;vis-type-or-id&gt;]  [-scale]  [-help]  [-rv]
       [-plane number] [-fg color] [-bg color] [-dumpheader]

DESCRIPTION
       Xwud  is an X Window System image undumping utility.  Xwud allows X users
       to display in a window an image saved in a specially formatted dump file,
       such as produced by xwd(1).

OPTIONS
       -bg color
               If  a  bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed,
               this option can be used to specify the color to display  for  the
               &quot;0&quot; bits in the image.

       -display display
               This  option  allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
               X(7).

       -dumpheader
               This option prints out the XWD header information only.   Nothing
               is displayed.

       -fg color
               If  a  bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed,
               this option can be used to specify the color to display  for  the
               &quot;1&quot; bits in the image.

       -geometry geom
               This  option  allows  you to specify the size and position of the
               window.  Typically you will only want to  specify  the  position,
               and let the size default to the actual size of the image.

       -help   Print out a short description of the allowable options.

       -in file
               This  option allows the user to explicitly specify the input file
               on the command line.  If no input file  is  given,  the  standard
               input is assumed.

       -new    This  option forces creation of a new colormap for displaying the
               image.  If the image characteristics happen to match those of the
               display,  this can get the image on the screen faster, but at the
               cost of using a new colormap (which on most displays  will  cause
               other windows to go technicolor).

       -noclick
               Clicking any button in the window will terminate the application,
               unless this option  is  specified.   Termination  can  always  be
               achieved by typing &apos;q&apos;, &apos;Q&apos;, or ctrl-c.

       -plane number
               You  can  select  a single bit plane of the image to display with
               this option.  Planes are numbered with zero being the least  sig&#8208;
               nificant bit.

       -raw    This  option forces the image to be displayed with whatever color
               values happen to currently exist on the screen.  This  option  is
               mostly  useful  when undumping an image back onto the same screen
               that the image originally came from, while the  original  windows
               are  still on the screen, and results in getting the image on the
               screen faster.

       -rv     If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image)  is  displayed,
               this  option  forces  the  foreground and background colors to be
               swapped.  This may be needed when displaying a bitmap image which
               has  the  color  sense  of pixel values &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; reversed from
               what they are on your display.

       -scale  Allow the window to be resized, and scale the image to  the  size
               of the window.

       -std maptype
               This  option causes the image to be displayed using the specified
               Standard Colormap.  The property name is obtained  by  converting
               the  type to upper case, prepending &quot;RGB_&quot;, and appending &quot;_MAP&quot;.
               Typical types are &quot;best&quot;, &quot;default&quot;, and &quot;gray&quot;.  See xstdcmap(1)
               for one way of creating Standard Colormaps.

       -vis vis-type-or-id
               This  option  allows you to specify a particular visual or visual
               class.  The default is to pick  the  &quot;best&quot;  one.   A  particular
               class can be specified: &quot;StaticGray&quot;, &quot;GrayScale&quot;, &quot;StaticColor&quot;,
               &quot;PseudoColor&quot;, &quot;DirectColor&quot;, or &quot;TrueColor&quot;.  Or &quot;Match&quot; can  be
               specified,  meaning  use  the  same  class  as  the source image.
               Alternatively, an exact visual id (specific to the server) can be
               specified, either as a hexadecimal number (prefixed with &quot;0x&quot;) or
               as a decimal number.  Finally, &quot;default&quot; can be specified,  mean&#8208;
               ing  to  use  the  same class as the colormap of the root window.
               Case is not significant in any of these strings.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY To get default display.

FILES
       XWDFile.h
               X Window Dump File format definition file.

BUGS
       xwud doesn&apos;t handle big/deep images very well on servers that don&apos;t  have
       the BIG-REQUESTS extension.
