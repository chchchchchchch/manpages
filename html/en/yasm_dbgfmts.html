YASM_DBGFMTS(7)           Yasm Supported Debug Formats           YASM_DBGFMTS(7)



NAME
       yasm_dbgfmts - Yasm Supported Debugging Formats

SYNOPSIS
       yasm -g dbgfmt ...

DESCRIPTION
       The standard Yasm distribution includes a number of modules for different
       debugging formats. The debugging information is embedded into the object
       file. Use of a non-&#8220;null&#8221; debug format also causes Yasm to output all
       symbols to the object file (including local symbols).

       The debug format is selected on the yasm(1) command line by use of the -g
       dbgfmt command line option.

CV8
       The CV8 debug format is used by Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (version
       8.0) and is completely undocumented, although it bears strong
       similarities to earlier CodeView formats. Yasm&#180;s support for the CV8
       debug format is currently limited to generating assembly-level line
       number information (to allow some level of source-level debugging). The
       CV8 debug information is stored in the .debug$S and .debug$T sections of
       the Win64 object file.

DWARF2
       The DWARF 2 debug format is a complex, well-documented standard for
       debugging information. It was created to overcome shortcomings in STABS,
       allowing for much more detailed and compact descriptions of data
       structures, data variable movement, and complex language structures such
       as in C++. The debugging information is stored in sections (just like
       normal program sections) in the object file. Yasm supports full
       pass-through of DWARF2 debugging information (e.g. from a C++ compiler),
       and can also generate assembly-level line number information.

NULL
       The &#8220;null&#8221; debug format is a placeholder; it adds no debugging
       information to the output file.

STABS
       The STABS debug format is a poorly documented, semi-standard format for
       debugging information in COFF and ELF object files. The debugging
       information is stored as part of the object file&#180;s symbol table and thus
       is limited in complexity and scope. Despite this, STABS is a common
       debugging format on older Unix and compatible systems, as well as DJGPP.
