YASM_OBJFMTS(7)           Yasm Supported Object Formats          YASM_OBJFMTS(7)



NAME
       yasm_objfmts - Yasm Supported Object Formats

SYNOPSIS
       yasm -f objfmt ...

DESCRIPTION
       The standard Yasm distribution includes a number of modules for different
       object formats (Yasm&#180;s primary output).

       The object format is selected on the yasm(1) command line by use of the
       -f objfmt command line option.

BIN
       The &#8220;bin&#8221; object format produces a flat-format, non-relocatable binary
       file. It is appropriate for producing DOS .COM executables or things like
       boot blocks. It supports only 3 sections and those sections are written
       in a predefined order to the output file.

COFF
       The COFF object format is an older relocatable object format used on
       older Unix and compatible systems, and also (more recently) on the DJGPP
       development system for DOS.

DBG
       The &#8220;dbg&#8221; object format is not a &#8220;real&#8221; object format; the output file it
       creates simply describes the sequence of calls made to it by Yasm and the
       final object and symbol table information in a human-readable text format
       (that in a normal object format would get processed into that object
       format&#180;s particular binary representation). This object format is not
       intended for real use, but rather for debugging Yasm&#180;s internals.

ELF
       The ELF object format really comes in two flavors: &#8220;elf32&#8221; (for 32-bit
       targets) and &#8220;elf64&#8221; (for 64-bit targets). ELF is a standard object
       format in common use on modern Unix and compatible systems (e.g. Linux,
       FreeBSD). ELF has complex support for relocatable and shared objects.

MACHO
       The Mach-O object format really comes in two flavors: &#8220;macho32&#8221; (for
       32-bit targets) and &#8220;macho64&#8221; (for 64-bit targets). Mach-O is used as the
       object format on MacOS X. As Yasm currently only supports x86 and AMD64
       instruction sets, it can only generate Mach-O objects for Intel-based
       Macs.

RDF
       The RDOFF2 object format is a simple multi-section format originally
       designed for NASM. It supports segment references but not WRT references.
       It was designed primarily for simplicity and has minimalistic headers for
       ease of loading and linking. A complete toolchain (linker, librarian, and
       loader) is distributed with NASM.

WIN32
       The Win32 object format produces object files compatible with Microsoft
       compilers (such as Visual C++) that target the 32-bit x86 Windows
       platform. The object format itself is an extended version of COFF.

WIN64
       The Win64 object format produces object files compatible with Microsoft
       compilers that target the 64-bit &#8220;x64&#8221; Windows platform. This format is
       very similar to the win32 object format, but produces 64-bit objects.
&#12;XDF
       The XDF object format is essentially a simplified version of COFF. It&#180;s a
       multi-section relocatable format that supports 64-bit physical and
       virtual addresses.
