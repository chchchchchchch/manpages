YASM_PARSERS(7)              Yasm Supported Parsers              YASM_PARSERS(7)



NAME
       yasm_parsers - Yasm Supported Parsers (Assembler Syntaxes)

SYNOPSIS
       yasm -p parser [-r preproc] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The standard Yasm distribution includes a number of modules for different
       parsers (assembler syntaxes).

       The parser is selected on the yasm(1) command line by use of the -p
       parser command line option.

NASM PARSER
       NASM syntax, selected with -p nasm, is the most full-featured syntax
       supported by Yasm. Yasm is nearly 100% compatible with NASM for 16-bit
       and 32-bit x86 code. Yasm additionally supports 64-bit AMD64 code with
       Yasm extensions to the NASM syntax; see yasm_arch(7) for details. NASM
       syntax is the Yasm default.

GAS PARSER
       The GNU Assembler (GAS) is the de-facto cross-platform assembler for
       modern Unix systems, and is used as the backend for the GCC compiler.
       Yasm&#180;s support for GAS syntax is moderately good, although immature: not
       all directives are supported, and only 32-bit x86 and AMD64 architectures
       are supported. Nearly all of the GAS preprocessor is also supported.
       Yasm&#180;s GAS syntax support is good enough to handle essentially all x86
       and AMD64 GCC compiler output. The GAS parser can be selected with -p
       gas.
