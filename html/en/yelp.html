NAME
       yelp &#8212; browse system documentation

USAGE
       yelp [file]

       The  GNOME  Help Browser includes detailed documentation for the majority
       of applications, utilities and other components, such as the panel or the
       Nautilus file manager.


       Yelp can display some HTML and XML files when passed on the command-line,
       but it&apos;s primarily called from applications.

       You can also start Yelp by choosing Desktop-&gt;Help.  This  will  show  the
       top-level  help  system  page,  listing  all GNOME documents conveniently
       organized by topic.

OPTIONS
       This program accepts all the standard GNOME and GTK+ options, which  fol&#8208;
       low  the  usual  GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with
       two dashes (`-&apos;). To get more information about these options launch Yelp
       with the `--help&apos; argument.
