NAME
       zbarcam - scan and decode bar codes from a video device

SYNOPSIS
       zbarcam [-qv] [--quiet] [--nodisplay] [--xml] [--verbose[=n]]
               [--prescale=WxH] [-S[symbology.]config[=value]]
               [--set [symbology.]config[=value]] [device]

       zbarcam {-h | --help | --version}

DESCRIPTION
       zbarcam scans a video4linux video source (eg, a webcam) for bar codes and
       prints any decoded data to the standard output. The video stream is also
       displayed to the screen.

       device is the path to the video4linux (version 1 or 2) character device
       special file (major number 81 and minor number 0 thru 63). It defaults to
       /dev/video0

       The underlying library currently supports EAN-13 (including UPC and ISBN
       subsets), EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, and Interleaved 2 of 5 symbologies.
       The specific type of each detected symbol is printed with the decoded
       data.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax. Single letter
       options may be bundled, long options start with two dashes (`-&#180;).

       -h, --help
           Print a short help message describing command line options to
           standard output and exit

       --version
           Print program version information to standard output and exit

       -v, --verbose[=n]
           Increase debug output level. Multiple -v options create more spew.
           Alternatively specify n to set the debug level directly

       -S[symbology.]config[=value], --set [symbology.]config[=value]
           Set decoder configuration option config for symbology to value.
           value defaults to 1 if omitted.  symbology is one of ean13, ean8,
           upca, upce, isbn13, isbn10, i25, code39, code128 or the special value
           *. If symbology is omitted or *, the config will be set for all
           applicable symbologies. These are the currently recognized configs.
           Prefix a config with &quot;no-&quot; to negate it. Not all configs are
           appropriate for every symbology.

           enable
               Control decoding/reporting of a symbology. For symbologies which
               are just subsets of ean13 (upca, upce, isbn13, isbn10), this
               config controls whether the subsets are detected and reported as
               such. These special cases are disabled by default, all other
               symbologies default to enabled

           disable
               Antonym for enable

           emit-check
               Control whether check digits are included in the decoded output.
               Enabled by default. This config does not apply for code128, which
               never returns the check digit. It also not apply for cases where
               the check digit is disabled (see add-check). Check digits are
               currently not implemented for i25 or code39

           add-check
               Enable decode and verification of a check digit for symbologies
               where it is optional: this will include code39 and i25, neither
               of which implements the check digit yet

           ascii
               Enable escape sequences that encode the full ASCII character set.
               This would apply to code39, except that it&#180;s not implemented
               either...

           position
               Enable collection of symbol position information. Enabled by
               default. Currently, the position information is unusable, so you
               can save a few cycles by disabling this.

           min-length=n, max-length=n
               Bound the number of decoded characters in a valid symbol. If a
               decode result is outside the configured min/max range
               (inclusive), it will not be reported. Set to 0 to disable the
               corresponding check. This setting applies to variable-length
               symbologies: i25, code39, code128 and pdf417.  min-length
               defaults to 6 for i25 and 1 for code39 (per Code 39
               autodiscrimination recommendation); all others default to 0

           x-density=n, y-density=n
               Adjust the density of the scanner passes. Lower values scan more
               of the image at the cost of decreased performance. Setting to 0
               disables scanning along that axis. Defaults are both 1.

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet operation; disable the audible beep otherwise emitted when a
           symbol is decoded

       --nodisplay
           Disable output video window. Video input will be scanned until the
           program is interrupted or otherwise signaled

       --xml
           Stream results using an XML output format. This format wraps the raw
           data from the symbol with information about the scan in an easy to
           parse format. The latest schema is available from
           http://zbar.sourceforge.net/2008/barcode.xsd

       --raw
           Use raw symbol data output format. This format prints symbol data
           separated by newlines without the additional symbology type
           information that is printed by default

       --prescale=WxH
           Request video input scaling from the camera driver. Possibly useful
           for reducing huge frames to achieve a higher frame rate. Note that
           the driver may adjust or completely ignore the scaling request

EXAMPLES
       Scan for barcodes using the second video device and pipe the resulting
       data through a script that searches for each code in a database and does
       something useful with them:

           zbarcam /dev/video1 | upcrpc.py

       The upcrpc.py example script included in the examples/ subdirectory of
       the distribution will make an XMLRPC call to a popular internet UPC
       database and print the product description if found.

       Scan for barcodes using the default video device and stream results to
       stdout in XML format, also disable recognition of Interleaved 2 of 5
       codes to prevent confusion with other symbologies or background noise:

           zbarcam --xml -Si25.disable

       Scan only for Code 39, without using the preview window - maybe for a
       fixed installation. To enable only Code 39, first all symbologies are
       disabled, then Code 39 is re-enabled:

           zbarcam --nodisplay -Sdisable -Scode39.enable
