ZDIFF(1)                                                                ZDIFF(1)



NAME
       zcmp, zdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       zcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       zdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zcmp  and  zdiff  are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on files
       compressed via gzip.  All options specified are passed directly to cmp or
       diff.   If only one file is specified, then it is compared to a file with
       the same name without the .gz extension. If two files are specified, then
       they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff.  The exit sta&#8208;
       tus from cmp or diff is preserved.

       When both files must be uncompressed before  comparison,  the  second  is
       uncompressed  to  /tmp.   In  all  other cases, zdiff and zcmp use only a
       pipe.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1),  diff(1),  zmore(1),  zgrep(1),  znew(1),   zforce(1),   gzip(1),
       gzexe(1)

BUGS
       Messages  from  the  cmp  or  diff  programs refer to temporary filenames
       instead of those specified.
