ZEITGEIST-DAEMON(1)                                          ZEITGEIST-DAEMON(1)



NAME
       zeitgeist-daemon - D-Bus interface providing a log of activities


SYNOPSIS
       zeitgeist-daemon [OPTION]


DESCRIPTION
       zeitgeist-daemon  is  daemon  providing an activity log. That is, it con&#8208;
       sists of a central database for events such as file usage,  browser  his&#8208;
       tory, calendar entries, etc.

       All  this  information  is  made available to external applications which
       communicate with zeitgeist-daemon over D-Bus. Interested applications can
       request information, insert new events or delete existing events.

       Zeitgeist  is  also capable of establishing relationships between activi&#8208;
       ties. Its purpose is enabling an  activity-aware  desktop  with  adaptive
       user interfaces.

       By default, zeitgeist-daemon will also start the bundled logging applica&#8208;
       tion zeitgeist-datahub.


OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual  GNU  command  line  syntax,  with  options
       starting with two dashes (`--&apos;). A summary of options is included below.

       --no-datahub
              Do not start zeitgeist-datahub together with this daemon.

       --replace
              Replace  any  existing  Zeitgeist instance if there is one already
              running. If this option isn&apos;t used, zeitgeist-daemon  will  refuse
              to start if another running instance is found.

       --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
              Specifies  how  much information should be printed to the standard
              output.  Possible values are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR,  CRITI&#8208;
              CAL.

       --quit Stop  a  currently  running Zeitgeist instance and exit. This lets
              Zeitgeist finish any operation it may currently be doing.

       -v, --version
              Shows which version of Zeitgeist is being executed.

       --help Shows a short help message listing all supported options.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       ZEITGEIST_DATA_PATH
              Overrides the directory where user  data  files  are  placed.  The
              default    value    is   that   of   XDG&apos;s   data   dir   (usually
              ~/.local/share/zeitgeist).

       ZEITGEIST_DATABASE_PATH
              This variable lets you specify an override for the filename of the
              main  database.  The  default value is $ZEITGEIST_DATA_PATH/activ&#8208;
              ity.sqlite.
&#12;       ZEITGEIST_DATABASE_BACKUP_PATH
              This variable lets you specify an override for the filename  of  a
              possible   database   backup.   The   default   value   is  $ZEIT&#8208;
              GEIST_DATA_PATH/activity.sqlite.bck.

       ZEITGEIST_DISABLED_EXTENSIONS
              This variable lets you specify comma separated list  of  extension
              names which shouldn&apos;t be loaded. The names are extracted from type
              names of the extensions, so to disable extension  with  type  name
              ZeitgeistDataSourceRegistry, value of the variable should be Data&#8208;
              SourceRegistry.


SIGNALS
       SIGHUP: zeitgeist-daemon will shut itself down in a clean way.
              It is recommended that system updates of Zeitgeist send this  sig&#8208;
              nal  to all running instances of zeitgeist-daemon. DBus activation
              will make sure the updated  software  is  automatically  restarted
              when needed.


EXIT CODES
       0      Zeitgeist terminated normally.

       1      An unspecified error occurred.

       10     There is already a running Zeitgeist instance.

       21     Could not access the database file.
