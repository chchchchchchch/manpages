ZLESS(1)                                                                ZLESS(1)



NAME
       zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

SYNOPSIS
       zless [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zless  is  a  filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text
       files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equiva&#8208;
       lent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to &apos;|gzip -cdfq -- %s&apos;,
       and  the  environment  variable   LESSMETACHARS   to   &apos;&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;new&#8208;
       line&gt;;*?&quot;()&lt;&gt;[|&amp;^`#\$%=~&apos;, and then running less.  However, enough people
       seem to think that having the command zless available is important to  be
       worth providing it.

SEE ALSO
       zmore(1), less(1)

BUGS
       Zless does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard
       input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.   To  read
       compressed  data  from  a  pipe,  you  can use ...|gunzip|less instead of
       ...|zless.
