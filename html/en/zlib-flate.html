ZLIB-FLATE(1)                     User Commands                    ZLIB-FLATE(1)



NAME
       zlib-flate - raw zlib compression program

SYNOPSIS
       zlib-flate -compress | -uncompress

DESCRIPTION
       The zlib-flate program is part of the qpdf package.

       The  zlib-flate  program reads from standard input and writes to standard
       output either compressing or uncompressing its input using raw zlib  com&#8208;
       pression.   It  can  be used to uncompress or compress raw PDF streams or
       other data that is compressed with raw zlib compression.  This program is
       provided primarily as a debugging tool, though it could be used for other
       purposes, such as being called from a  script  that  creates  simple  PDF
       files.

       This  program  should  not be used as a general purpose compression tool.
       Use something like gzip(1) instead.

       For details about qpdf, please see the qpdf manual, which can be found in
       /usr/share/doc/qpdf/qpdf-manual.html   or   /usr/share/doc/qpdf/qpdf-man&#8208;
