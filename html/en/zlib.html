ZLIB(3)                                                                  ZLIB(3)



NAME
       zlib - compression/decompression library

SYNOPSIS
       [see zlib.h for full description]

DESCRIPTION
       The zlib library is a general purpose data compression library.  The code
       is thread safe, assuming that the standard  library  functions  used  are
       thread  safe,  such as memory allocation routines.  It provides in-memory
       compression and decompression functions, including  integrity  checks  of
       the  uncompressed  data.   This  version of the library supports only one
       compression method (deflation) but other algorithms may  be  added  later
       with the same stream interface.

       Compression  can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough
       or can be done by repeated calls of the  compression  function.   In  the
       latter  case,  the application must provide more input and/or consume the
       output (providing more output space) before each call.

       The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip(1) (.gz) for&#8208;
       mat with an interface similar to that of stdio.

       The  library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks the
       consistency of the compressed data, so the  library  should  never  crash
       even in the case of corrupted input.

       All  functions  of  the  compression  library  are documented in the file
       zlib.h.  The distribution source includes examples of use of the  library
       in  the  files test/example.c and test/minigzip.c, as well as other exam&#8208;
       ples in the examples/ directory.

       Changes to this version are documented in the file ChangeLog that  accom&#8208;
       panies the source.

       zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package:

              http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/com&#8208;
              pression/

       A Perl interface to zlib, written by Paul  Marquess  (pmqs@cpan.org),  is
       available at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including:

              http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/

       A Python interface to zlib, written by A.M. Kuchling (amk@magnet.com), is
       available in Python 1.5 and later versions:

              http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html

       zlib is built into tcl:

       An experimental package to read and write files in .zip  format,  written
       on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com), is available at:

              http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html  and also in the con&#8208;
              trib/minizip directory of the main zlib source distribution.

       The zlib web site can be found at:

       The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFC (Request for
       Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files:

              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950   (for   the  zlib  header  and
              trailer format)
              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951  (for  the  deflate  compressed
              data format)
              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952   (for   the  gzip  header  and
              trailer format)

       Mark Nelson wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997 issue  of   Dr.
       Dobb&apos;s Journal; a copy of the article is available at:

REPORTING PROBLEMS
       Before reporting a problem, please check the zlib web site to verify that
       you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise, obtain the latest version
       and see if the problem still exists.  Please read the zlib FAQ at:

              http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html

       before asking for help.  Send questions and/or comments to zlib@gzip.org,
       or (for the Windows DLL version) to Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com).
