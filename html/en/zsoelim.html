ZSOELIM(1)                     Manual pager utils                     ZSOELIM(1)



NAME
       zsoelim - satisfy .so requests in roff input

SYNOPSIS
       zsoelim [-CVh] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zsoelim  parses  file  arguments,  or if none are specified, its standard
       input for lines of the form:

       .so &lt;filename&gt;

       These requests are replaced by the contents of  the  filename  specified.
       If  the  request cannot be met, zsoelim looks for filename.ext where .ext
       can be one of .gz, .Z or .z.  Other  extension  types  may  be  supported
       depending upon compile time options.  If the request can be met by a com&#8208;
       pressed file, this file is decompressed using an appropriate decompressor
       and its output is used to satisfy the request.

       Traditionally,  soelim  programs were used to allow roff preprocessors to
       be able to preprocess the files referred to by the requests.   This  par&#8208;
       ticular version was written to circumvent problems created by support for
       compressed manual pages.

OPTIONS
       -C, --compatible
              This flag is available for compatibility with  other  soelim  pro&#8208;
              grams.   Its  use  is to enable .so requests followed by something
              other than whitespace.  As this is already the default  behaviour,
              it is ignored.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
